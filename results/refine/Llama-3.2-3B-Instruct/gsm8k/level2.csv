"To determine Janet's daily earnings at the farmers' market, we must first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she consumes and bakes.

Janet's daily egg production is 16. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast, leaving her with 16 - 3 = 13 eggs. She then bakes 4 eggs for her friends, resulting in 13 - 4 = 9 eggs available for sale.

The selling price of each egg is $2. To find Janet's daily earnings, we multiply the number of eggs sold (9) by the selling price ($2):

9 eggs * $2/egg = $18

Janet's daily earnings at the farmers' market are $18."
"To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we must consider the ratio of blue to white fiber. The problem states that the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber. This implies a direct proportionality between the two types of fiber.

Let's represent the number of white fiber bolts as x. Since the amount of white fiber is half that of blue fiber, we can express this relationship as:

2 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 2 / 2
x = 1

Now that we know the number of white fiber bolts, we can calculate the total number of bolts by adding the blue and white fiber bolts:

Total bolts = 2 (blue) + 1 (white)
Total bolts = 3

Therefore, the total number of bolts required for the robe is 3."
"To calculate the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To find the new value, we multiply the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase). 

New value = $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000

Now, we subtract the original price from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

The final answer is: $120,000"
"To calculate the total number of meters James runs per week, we can utilize the fundamental principles of arithmetic. Specifically, we will employ the multiplication operation, which is a basic yet essential concept in mathematics.

The problem involves multiplying the number of sprints per week (3) by the number of meters per sprint (60). This can be represented as:

3 × 60 = 180

Therefore, James runs a total of 180 meters per week."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we must first calculate the total daily feed required for her flock. Since each chicken receives three cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens, the total daily feed can be calculated as follows:

Total daily feed = 3 cups/chicken * 20 chickens
Total daily feed = 60 cups

Since Wendi has already provided 40 cups of feed, we can find the remaining amount needed for the final meal by subtracting the amount already given from the total daily feed:

Remaining feed = Total daily feed - Feed already given
Remaining feed = 60 cups - 40 cups
Remaining feed = 20 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs 20 cups of feed for the final meal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the glasses, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is a straightforward $5.

For the remaining 15 glasses, we need to calculate 60% of the original price of $5. This can be expressed as 0.6 * $5.

Let's calculate the cost of the remaining 15 glasses: 15 * 0.6 * $5 = $45.

Now, we add the cost of the first glass to the cost of the remaining glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay a total of $50 for the 16 glasses.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we can utilize the given information to establish a linear relationship between the number of sheep in each city.

Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as S, Charleston as C, and Toulouse as T. We are given the following relationships:

1. C = 4S (Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle)
2. T = 2C (Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston)

We can substitute the expression for C from equation (1) into equation (2) to find the relationship between S and T:

T = 2(4S)
T = 8S

Now, we are given that S = 20. We can substitute this value into the equation T = 8S to find the number of sheep in Toulouse:

T = 8(20)
T = 160

Now, we can find the total number of sheep in all three cities by adding the number of sheep in each city:

Total = S + C + T
Total = 20 + 4(20) + 160
Total = 20 + 80 + 160
Total = 260

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To calculate the total time it takes to download the file, we need to consider the two distinct phases of the download process: the initial download and the restart.

The initial download consists of Carla downloading 80% of the 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute. To find the time taken for this phase, we can use the formula:

Time = Total Amount / Rate

Time = (0.8 * 200 GB) / 2 GB/minute
Time = 160 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 80 minutes

However, this initial download is interrupted by a 20-minute restart. Therefore, we need to add this time to the initial download time.

Total Time = Initial Download Time + Restart Time
Total Time = 80 minutes + 20 minutes
Total Time = 100 minutes

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we can break down his journey into segments.

Let's denote the distance from home as 'd'. 

1. John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph:
d = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

2. He spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move:
d = 180 miles

3. He drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
d = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

4. He drives for 2 hours at 80 mph:
d = 80 * 2 = 160 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance traveled. Since John is initially 180 miles away from home, we subtract the distance traveled from the initial distance:
d = 180 - 15 + 160 = 325 miles

Therefore, John is 325 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{325}$"
"To calculate Eliza's total earnings for the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: regular hours and overtime hours.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the regular hours:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Next, we need to calculate her earnings for the overtime hours. Since she worked 5 hours of overtime, we multiply the overtime pay rate (1.2 times her regular hourly rate) by the number of overtime hours:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 = 5 * 12 = $60

Now, we add the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours to find the total earnings:
$400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460.

Final answer: $460"
"To calculate the total number of downloads over the three months, we can break it down into individual components.

First, we need to find the number of downloads in the second month, which is three times the downloads in the first month. This can be expressed as:

Downloads in Month 2 = 3 * Downloads in Month 1
= 3 * 60
= 180

Next, we need to calculate the number of downloads in the third month, which is 30% less than the downloads in the second month. This can be expressed as:

Downloads in Month 3 = Downloads in Month 2 - (30% of Downloads in Month 2)
= 180 - (0.3 * 180)
= 180 - 54
= 126

Now, we can find the total number of downloads over the three months by adding the downloads in each month:

Total Downloads = Downloads in Month 1 + Downloads in Month 2 + Downloads in Month 3
= 60 + 180 + 126
= 366

The final answer is: $\boxed{366}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we can break down the problem into individual components and apply the necessary arithmetic operations.

First, we'll calculate the cost of each item:

Donuts: 3 dozen donuts * $68 per dozen = 3 * 68 = $204
Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen cupcakes * $80 per dozen = 2 * 80 = $160
Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen cheesecakes * $55 per dozen = 6 * 55 = $330

Now, we'll add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To determine the break-even point for the lemon tree, we can set up an equation based on the net profit per year. Let's denote the number of years as 't'. The initial cost of the tree is $90, and the net profit per year is $7.50.

The equation to represent the break-even point is:

90 = 7.50t

To solve for 't', we can divide both sides by 7.50:

t = 90 / 7.50
t = 12

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

Final answer: 12"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as x.

We know that Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which can be represented as x/3. She sold 2 more at the red house, so the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red houses is x/3 + 2.

The remaining vacuum cleaners are then sold at the orange house, which is half of what was left after the green and red house sales. This can be expressed as (x - (x/3 + 2))/2.

We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) = 5

To simplify the equation, we can first combine like terms:

(2x/3 - 2) = 5

Next, we can add 2 to both sides:

2x/3 = 7

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

2x = 21

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 21/2

x = 10.5

Since the number of vacuum cleaners must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot sell a fraction of a vacuum cleaner.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we must first calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

The number of students enrolled in contemporary dance is 20% of the total, which can be calculated as 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16.

The number of students enrolled in jazz dance is 25% of the remaining students, which can be calculated as 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

Now, we can find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting the students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total: 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

Therefore, the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine the best choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option using the concept of compound interest. We'll apply the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount after t years, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time the money is invested for.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost (P) = $5,000
Market increase (r) = 2.5% or 0.025
Time (t) = 1 month
Assuming monthly compounding, n = 12

Potential value = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025/12)^(12*1) ≈ $5,250.63

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost (P) = $8,000
Market increase (r) = 1.2% or 0.012
Time (t) = 1 month
Assuming monthly compounding, n = 12

Potential value = $8,000 * (1 + 0.012/12)^(12*1) ≈ $8,160.96

Since the potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160.96) is higher than the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250.63), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250.63 - $5,000 = $250.63
For electronic gadgets: $8,160.96 - $8,000 = $160.96

The merchant would make a profit of $160.96 by choosing the electronic gadgets."
"In the context of two-dimensional space, we can analyze the motion of the trains using vector addition. Let's consider the initial positions of the trains as the origin (0, 0) of a coordinate system. Since they travel westward for 80 miles on the first day, their positions become (-80, 0).

On the second day, they travel northward for 150 miles. We can represent this as a vector addition, where the northward movement is added to their initial position. The resulting position of each train is (-80, 150).

To find the total distance covered by each train, we can use the distance formula:

d = √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)

where (x1, y1) = (-80, 0) and (x2, y2) = (-80, 150)

d = √((-80 - (-80))² + (150 - 0)²)
d = √(0² + 150²)
d = √(0 + 22500)
d = √22500
d = 150

The distance covered by each train in the two days is 150 miles.

The final answer is: 150"
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we can break down her earnings into two components: teaching and coaching. 

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from teaching: 35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching would be $700/week * 50 weeks = $35,000.

Next, we'll calculate her weekly earnings from coaching: 15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week. Her annual earnings from coaching would be $450/week * 50 weeks = $22,500.

Now, we can find her total annual salary by adding her earnings from teaching and coaching: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we can utilize the concept of unit conversions. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can calculate the total number of eggs in 4 weeks and then convert it to dozens.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks: 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Now, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 84 eggs ÷ 12 = 7.

Therefore, Claire eats 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the required speed for the remaining distance, we can utilize the concept of average speed and the formula for average speed, which is:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

We know that Marissa wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail. Let's denote the time spent walking the remaining distance as 't'. The total time spent will be the sum of the time spent walking the first 4 miles (1 hour) and the time spent walking the next 2 miles (1 hour), which is 2 hours, plus the time 't' spent walking the remaining distance.

Total Time = 2 + t

We can set up an equation using the average speed formula:

4 = 12 / (2 + t)

To solve for 't', we can first multiply both sides of the equation by (2 + t) to eliminate the fraction:

4(2 + t) = 12

Expanding the left side of the equation:

8 + 4t = 12

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

4t = 4

Dividing both sides by 4:

t = 1

Now that we have found the time 't', we can calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:

Required Speed = Distance / Time
= 6 / 1
= 6 miles per hour

The final answer is 6."
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 49/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water: 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters.

To add the remaining amount of the orange drink to the pineapple drink, we need to convert the 1 liter to a fraction with a denominator of 3: 1 = 3/3.

Now, we can add the remaining amount of the orange drink to the pineapple drink: 9 + 3/3 = 30/3 liters.

The total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, so the amount of the pineapple drink is 24 - 9 = 15 liters.

Now, we can calculate the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters: 
The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters, and the amount of water in the remaining 15 liters of orange drink is 30/3 - 10/3 = 20/3 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 9 + 20/3 = 9 + 20/3 = 39/3 liters.

To convert the improper fraction to a mixed number, we divide the numerator by the denominator: 39 ÷ 3 = 13 with a remainder of 0.

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 13 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the number of years ago Raymond's son was born, we can use the information provided. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Raymond's current age is 25 (31 - 6, since he was born 6 years before Samantha). We also know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23.

To find the number of years ago his son was born, we subtract the son's age at the time of birth (23) from Raymond's current age (25).

25 - 23 = 2

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

Final answer: 2"
"To determine the total number of DVDs sold by Billy, we can employ the concept of arithmetic series. The first 3 customers purchased 1 DVD each, resulting in a total of 3 DVDs. The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, contributing 4 DVDs to the total. The last 3 customers made no purchases.

Using the principle of addition, we can calculate the total number of DVDs sold as follows:

3 (DVDs from the first 3 customers) + 4 (DVDs from the next 2 customers) + 0 (DVDs from the last 3 customers) = 7

Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total length reduction of the candle, we must first calculate the duration of the burning period. The time elapsed from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Given that the candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, we can calculate the total length reduction by multiplying the duration by the rate:

Length reduction = Duration * Rate
= 4 hours * 2 cm/hour
= 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Final answer: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the original price of the book, we can use the formula:

Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage)

In this case, the discounted price is $19.50 and the discount percentage is 25%. Plugging in the values, we get:

Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
Original Price = $19.50 / 0.75
Original Price = $26

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26."
"To determine the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of pizza boxes as x.

The total cost of the items, excluding pizza, is $12 (chicken meal) + $15 (5 packs of milk) + $6 (4 apples) = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

We know that each pizza box costs $8.50. To find the number of pizza boxes, we can divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box:

x = $17 ÷ $8.50

x = 2

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Mishka's clothing items, we can apply the principle of multiplication to find the cost of each type of item and then add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 × $16.50 = $49.50
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 × $22.50 = $67.50
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 × $42 = $126

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Therefore, Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To determine the total cost of ice cream, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Cynthia consumes one serving per night, resulting in a total of 60 servings over 60 days. Given that each carton contains 15 servings, we can calculate the number of cartons required as follows:

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To determine the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip: 60 - 20 = 40 miles
2. Distance from the end of the trip to the second stop: 60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:

40 - 45 = -5 miles

However, since distance cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's rephrase the question: Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. This means the second stop is 15 miles from the end of the trip, not from the first stop.

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip: 60 - 20 = 40 miles
Distance from the end of the trip to the second stop: 15 miles

Now, we add the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop:

40 + 15 = 55 miles

Therefore, the distance between Henry's first and second stops is 55 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the cost of the boots as 'b' and the cost of the first pair of heels as 'h1', and the cost of the second pair of heels as 'h2'.

We are given that h1 = $33 and h2 = 2h1. We also know that the total cost of the two pairs of heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots, so we can write the equation:

h1 + h2 = b - 5

Substituting the values of h1 and h2, we get:

$33 + 2($33) = b - 5

Combine like terms:

$99 = b - 5

Add 5 to both sides:

b = $104

Therefore, the cost of the boots is $104.

The final answer is: $104"
"To solve this problem, we can employ the concept of ratios and algebraic manipulation. Let's represent Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, where x is a common multiplier.

The total age of Darrell and Allen is given as 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combining like terms, we get:

18x = 162

To isolate x, we can divide both sides by 18:

x = 162 / 18
x = 9

Now that we have the value of x, we can find their current ages:

Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10
Allen's age 10 years from now = 109

The final answer is: $\boxed{109}$"
"To calculate the average of the three guesses, we can use the formula for the mean:

Mean = (Guess 1 + Guess 2 + Guess 3) / 3

Given the guesses, we can substitute the values into the formula:

Mean = (80 + 60 + 100) / 3

First, we'll add the guesses:

80 + 60 = 140
140 + 100 = 240

Now, we'll divide the sum by 3:

Mean = 240 / 3
Mean = 80

Therefore, the average guess is 80."
"To calculate the total hours spent taking care of dogs per week, we can utilize the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

First, we establish the daily care time per dog as 0.5 hours. Multiplying this value by the total number of dogs (10) yields the daily care time:

10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Next, we apply the concept of weekly duration by multiplying the daily care time by the number of days in a week (7):

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of his dogs.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of silver coins as x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as x + 30.

We are given that the total number of coins is 110. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides yields:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 40

Now that we have determined the number of silver coins, we can easily calculate the number of gold coins by adding 30 to x:

x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

Thus, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we can represent the number of jewels each person has with variables. Let's denote the number of jewels Siobhan has as S, the number of jewels Aaron has as A, and the number of jewels Raymond has as R.

We are given the following information:

1. R = 40 (Raymond has 40 jewels)
2. A = R/2 + 5 (Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels)
3. S = A - 2 (Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron)

We can substitute the expression for A from equation (2) into equation (3) to find S:

S = (R/2 + 5) - 2
S = (40/2 + 5) - 2
S = (20 + 5) - 2
S = 23

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To calculate the total points scored by Mike, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. This is a straightforward calculation, as it is a fixed value.

In the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we can multiply 4 by 0.25, which equals 1 point. Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To calculate Terry's total yogurt expenditure over 30 days, we can employ the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

First, we determine the daily yogurt consumption, which is 2 yogurts per day. Multiplying this by the number of days (30) yields a total of 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Next, we establish the cost of a single yogurt, which is $5.00 divided by 4, resulting in a cost of $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts (60) by the cost per yogurt ($1.25) to obtain the total expenditure: 60 * $1.25 = $75.

Therefore, Terry's total expenditure on yogurt over 30 days is $75.

Final answer: $75"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial number of Lego sets John had before selling them. We know he sold 13 sets for $15 each and had $5 left after buying 8 video games for $20 each.

First, let's calculate the total amount John got from selling the Lego sets: 13 * 15 = $195.

Next, we need to find out how much he spent on video games: 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find the initial amount he had by adding the amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left: $160 + $5 = $165.

Now, we can find the initial number of Lego sets by dividing the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets by the price of each set: 195 / 15 = 13.

However, this is the number of sets he sold. To find the initial number of sets, we need to add the number of sets he sold to the number of sets he still has. Since he sold all his sets, he still has 0 sets.

The final answer is 0."
"To determine John's speed, we must first calculate the total distance he covers in a week. Given that he runs 60 miles in a week, we can directly use this value as the total distance.

Next, we need to calculate the total time he spends running in a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much (1.5 hours) on the other two days. Therefore, the total time spent running is:

Total Time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours
Total Time = 6 hours

Now, we can find John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we can employ the concept of weighted averages to determine Dana's overall speed and then calculate the total distance traveled.

Let's denote Dana's walking speed as W and her running speed as R. We are given that R = 4W and W = 1.5 miles per hour. We can express Dana's overall speed as a weighted average of her walking and running speeds:

Overall Speed = (2/3)W + (1/3)R

Substituting the given values, we get:

Overall Speed = (2/3)(1.5) + (1/3)(4)(1.5)
= 1 + 2
= 3 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled in 6 hours:

Total Distance = Overall Speed * Time
= 3 * 6
= 18 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we can apply the given information using a step-by-step approach.

First, we know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows:

Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Next, we are told that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. To find Brandon's iPhone age, we can multiply Ben's iPhone age by 4:

Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the relationship between the distance Polly can throw the javelin with and without the gemstone. Let's denote the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone as x. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so the distance with the gemstone is 3x.

We are given that the dragon's range is 1000 feet, and we want to find the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone. This distance is the difference between the distance with the gemstone (3x) and the dragon's range (1000 feet).

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

3x - 1000 = distance

We are also given that the distance without the gemstone (x) is 400 feet. We can substitute this value into the equation:

3(400) - 1000 = distance

Simplifying the equation, we get:

1200 - 1000 = distance

1200 - 1000 = 200

Therefore, the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone is 200 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of pieces of pie taken by the guests, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

Let's denote the total number of pieces initially set out as T and the number of pieces remaining as R. We are given that T = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces and R = 14 pieces. 

The number of pieces taken by the guests can be calculated as T - R. 

T - R = 40 - 14
= 26

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the number of grams of chips you can eat, we need to calculate the remaining calories in your daily target and then convert that to grams.

First, let's calculate the remaining calories: 2000 (daily calorie target) - 1800 (calories consumed) = 200 calories left.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can find the number of servings you can have with 200 calories left by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

To convert the number of servings to grams, we know that each serving is 100g. Therefore, we multiply the number of servings by the grams per serving: 0.8 servings * 100g/serving = 80g.

So, you can eat 80g of chips."
"To calculate Charlie's net profit, we need to consider the cost of the beeswax and the wicks, as well as the revenue generated from selling the candles.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax and the cost of one pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00, the cost per candle can be calculated as follows:

Cost per candle = Total cost / Number of candles made per pound
Cost per candle = $10.00 / 10 candles
Cost per candle = $1.00

Now, we can calculate the total cost of producing 20 candles:

Total cost = Number of candles * Cost per candle
Total cost = 20 candles * $1.00 per candle
Total cost = $20.00

Next, we can calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle
Total revenue = $40.00

Finally, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20"
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we need to break down the information provided.

First, let's find the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of articles on Tuesday = 5 (Monday's articles) + (2/5 * 5)
= 5 + 2
= 7

Now, we can calculate the total hours spent on Tuesday:
7 articles * 4 hours per article = 28 hours

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
7 * 2 = 14 articles

Now, we can calculate the total hours spent on Wednesday:
14 articles * 4 hours per article = 56 hours

To find the total hours spent on all three days, we add the hours spent on each day:
Total hours = 20 hours (Monday) + 28 hours (Tuesday) + 56 hours (Wednesday)
= 104 hours

Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 104 hours writing articles in the three days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{104}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes Candice initially had as x. We know that she used 220 notes at work and had 23 notes remaining. Therefore, the total number of notes she had initially can be represented as x = 80 (initial notes in her purse) + 220 (notes used at work) + 23 (notes remaining).

x = 80 + 220 + 23

Combine like terms:

x = 323

However, we want to find the number of notes in the package she purchased. Let's denote the number of notes in the package as y. We know that the total number of notes Candice initially had is equal to the sum of the notes in her purse, the notes used at work, and the notes in the package:

x = 80 + 220 + y

Since we know that x = 323, we can substitute this value into the equation:

323 = 80 + 220 + y

Subtract 300 from both sides:

23 = y

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 23.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of blue ties as B and the cost of a blue tie as C. We are given that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the number of red ties is 2B. The cost of a red tie is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie, so the cost of a red tie is 1.5C.

We are also given that John spent $200 on blue ties, so we can write the equation:
B * C = 200

We know that the number of red ties is 2B, and the total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties. Since the cost of a red tie is 1.5C, the total amount spent on red ties is 2B * 1.5C = 3BC. Therefore, the total amount spent on ties is:
B * C + 3BC = 200 + 3BC

We can simplify this equation by factoring out B:
B(C + 3C) = 200
4BC = 200

Now, we can solve for C:
C = 200 / 4B
C = 50 / B

We are given that B * C = 200, so we can substitute C = 50 / B into this equation:
B * (50 / B) = 200
50 = 200

This equation is not true, so we need to re-examine our previous steps. Let's go back to the equation B * C = 200. We know that the cost of a red tie is 1.5C, so the total amount spent on red ties is 2B * 1.5C = 3BC. Therefore, the total amount spent on ties is:
B * C + 3BC = 200 + 3BC

We can simplify this equation by factoring out B:
B(C + 3C) = 200 + 3BC
B(4C) = 200 + 3BC
4BC - 3BC = 200
BC = 200

Now, we can solve for C:
C = 200 / B

We are given that the cost of a red tie is 1.5C, so the cost of a red tie is 1.5(200 / B). We know that the number of red ties is 2B, so the total amount spent on red ties is 2B * 1.5(200 / B) = 600. Therefore, the total amount spent on ties is:
B * C + 600

We can substitute C = 200 / B into this equation:
B * (200 / B) + 600
200 + 600
800

The final answer is: $\boxed{800}$"
"To determine the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, we can convert 4 feet to inches by multiplying 4 by 12:

4 feet × 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we must first calculate the total number of units. Given that there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, we can express this as a multiplication problem:

15 * 8 = 120 units

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units by the fraction representing the occupied portion:

(3/4) * 120 = 90 units

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

120 - 90 = 30 units

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To calculate the weekly earnings of Lloyd's egg farm, we can employ the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

First, we need to determine the total number of eggs produced per week. This can be achieved by multiplying the daily egg production (252 eggs) by the number of days in a week (7 days).

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Next, we must convert the total number of eggs to dozens, as the selling price is given per dozen. This can be accomplished by dividing the total number of eggs by 12.

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Finally, we can calculate the total weekly earnings by multiplying the number of dozen eggs sold by the selling price per dozen ($2).

147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

Therefore, Lloyd's weekly earnings from his egg farm are $294."
"To calculate the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first determine the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at a constant speed of 10 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

Given that the time elapsed from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = 10 mph x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the weight of the comic books Uriah is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

7.5 pounds

Now, Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: 15"
"To determine the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360, and the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480. The total revenue on Friday is $480.

To find the difference in revenue between the two days, we subtract the smaller revenue from the larger revenue: $480 - $520 = -$40. However, since we are looking for the day with higher revenue, we can conclude that Friday had lower revenue.

The correct answer is C."
"To determine the total number of kittens, we must first calculate the number of kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can express this relationship as an equation: 

Let x be the number of kittens Patchy had. Then, 3x = 12 (since Patchy had thrice the number of kittens as Trixie). Solving for x, we get x = 12 / 3 = 4.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had: 4 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 16 kittens.

Therefore, the Doubtfire family now has 16 kittens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the number of bags Jean can fill, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of lollipops per bag. 

The number of lollipops remaining after Jean eats 2 is 30 - 2 = 28. 

Now, we divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find the number of bags:
28 ÷ 2 = 14

Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

Final answer: 14"
"To determine the number of times Peter can go to the movies, we can use the following calculation:

Total money available: $42
Cost of ticket and popcorn: $14

We can divide the total money available by the cost of the ticket and popcorn to find the number of times Peter can go to the movies:

42 ÷ 14 = 3

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to consider the total weight available for the boxes. This can be calculated by subtracting the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can calculate the maximum number of boxes as follows:

Maximum number of boxes = Maximum weight available for boxes / Weight of a single box
= 245 / 15
= 16.33

Since we cannot load a fraction of a box, we must round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To calculate the final price of Stephen's groceries, we must first determine the total amount of the extra fees. The 25% fee is calculated as 0.25 times the original bill of $40.00, resulting in $10.00. Adding the $3.00 delivery fee, the total extra fees amount to $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00. Finally, we add the $4.00 tip, yielding a final total of $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To determine the total number of raspberries, we can employ the principle of addition. We have two distinct components to consider: the clusters and the individual raspberries.

First, we calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters. Since there are 6 clusters with 20 raspberries in each cluster, we can express this as 6 × 20. Multiplying these values, we obtain 120 raspberries in the clusters.

Next, we add the 67 individual raspberries to the total from the clusters. This gives us 120 + 67 = 187 raspberries.

Therefore, the total number of raspberries is 187."
"To determine the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the number of bad, sour, and unripe oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Now, subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges."
"To calculate the total amount Janet paid, we need to consider the costs associated with the brooch. The total cost consists of the material cost and the construction cost, which are $500 and $800, respectively. Additionally, she pays 10% of the total cost to insure the brooch.

The total cost of the brooch can be calculated as follows:

Total Cost = Material Cost + Construction Cost
Total Cost = $500 + $800
Total Cost = $1300

The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost, which can be calculated as:

Insurance Cost = 0.10 x Total Cost
Insurance Cost = 0.10 x $1300
Insurance Cost = $130

Therefore, the total amount Janet paid is the sum of the total cost and the insurance cost:

Total Amount Paid = Total Cost + Insurance Cost
Total Amount Paid = $1300 + $130
Total Amount Paid = $1430

The final answer is: $1430"
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the pension structure. For the first 20 years, her annual pension is a fixed amount of $50,000. 

For the remaining 10 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. Since the pension is $50,000, 5% of that is $2,500. 

To find the total annual pension after 30 years, we add the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the remaining 10 years:

$50,000 (first 20 years) + $2,500 (remaining 10 years) = $52,500

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $52,500."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month for 6 months. This can be calculated as:

140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. To find the amount she paid, we need to calculate 10% of the original amount and subtract it from the original amount.

10% of $140 is 0.1 * 140 = $14
The amount she paid for the second half of the year is 140 - 14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, she paid 126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year:
840 + 756 = $1596

Therefore, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To determine the miles per gallon (mpg) for Sophia's vehicle, we can use the formula:

mpg = Total Distance ÷ Total Fuel Consumption

We know the total distance Sophia has traveled since the last fill-up is 100 miles, and the total fuel consumption for that fill-up is 4 gallons. We also know the total capacity of her tank is 12 gallons.

First, let's calculate the total fuel consumption for the entire tank:
Total Fuel Consumption = Total Capacity - Remaining Fuel
Total Fuel Consumption = 12 gallons - 4 gallons
Total Fuel Consumption = 8 gallons

Now, we can calculate the miles per gallon:
mpg = Total Distance ÷ Total Fuel Consumption
mpg = 100 miles ÷ 8 gallons
mpg = 12.5 miles per gallon

Therefore, Sophia can drive 12.5 miles on a single tank of gas.

Final answer: $\boxed{12.5}$"
"To calculate the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we can break down the problem into two parts: hours spent watching TV and hours spent reading.

The total hours spent watching TV per week is 2 hours, and the total hours spent reading per week is 1 hour (half of the time spent watching TV). 

Since Jim does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on TV and reading per week is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly hours by 4: 3 * 4 = 12 hours.

Therefore, the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 12 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of people sent by the schools, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Each school has two teams, consisting of five players each, and one coach. Therefore, the total number of individuals per school is 2 (teams) * 5 (players per team) + 1 (coach) = 11.

Since there are four schools, the total number of individuals sent by the schools is 11 (individuals per school) * 4 (schools) = 44.

In conclusion, the total number of people sent by the schools is 44."
"To determine the total number of gems in the treasure chest, we can use the given information to set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of diamonds as D, rubies as R, and emeralds as E.

We know that the number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds, so we can express this as:

R = D - 35

We also know that the number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so we can express this as:

E = 2R

Substituting the expression for R into the equation for E, we get:

E = 2(D - 35)

Now, we are given that there are 175 diamonds. We can substitute this value into the equation for R:

R = D - 35
R = 175 - 35
R = 140

Now that we have the value of R, we can find the value of E:

E = 2R
E = 2(140)
E = 280

Finally, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:

Total = D + R + E
Total = 175 + 140 + 280
Total = 595

Therefore, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 595."
"To determine the number of teachers, we can utilize the ratio of students to teachers. Given that there are 5 students per teacher, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of teachers.

Let's denote the number of teachers as 't'. The ratio of students to teachers is 5:1, so the total number of students (60 girls + 120 boys = 180) can be expressed as 5t. 

We can set up the equation: 5t = 180

To solve for 't', we can divide both sides by 5:

t = 180 / 5
t = 36

Therefore, there are 36 teachers.

The final answer is 36."
"To determine the initial amount of money Bailey had, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the initial amount as 'x'. Since Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, the total amount of her allowance is 5 * 8 = $40. At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 40 = 100

To solve for x, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

So, Bailey started with $60."
"To calculate Judy's weekly earnings, we can break down the problem into manageable components. 

First, let's determine the total number of classes she teaches in a week. She teaches 5 classes per weekday, and there are 5 weekdays, resulting in 5 * 5 = 25 classes. Additionally, she teaches 8 classes on Saturday, bringing the total to 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week. With 33 classes and 15 students per class, the total number of students is 33 * 15 = 495.

"To determine the total number of instructions, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

We know that Recipe 1 has 20 instructions. Since Recipe 2 has twice as many instructions as Recipe 1, we can express this relationship as a multiplication factor. Let's denote the number of instructions in Recipe 2 as 2 times the number of instructions in Recipe 1. This can be represented as 2 * 20.

To find the total number of instructions, we add the number of instructions in both recipes: 20 + (2 * 20).

First, we calculate the multiplication: 2 * 20 = 40.

Then, we add the results: 20 + 40 = 60.

Therefore, Kelian has a total of 60 instructions to read to prepare the two dishes.

The final answer is: 60"
"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the number of brownies as B and the number of cheesecakes as C. We are given that the price of a brownie is $3 and the price of a cheesecake is $4.

The total amount of money raised from brownies can be represented as 3B, and the total amount of money raised from cheesecakes can be represented as 4C. We are given that B = 43 and C = 23.

To find the total amount of money raised, we can add the two expressions together: 3B + 4C. Substituting the given values, we get:

3(43) + 4(23) = 129 + 92

Using the commutative and associative properties of addition, we can simplify the expression:

129 + 92 = 221

Therefore, the total amount of money Tommy raises is $221."
"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay for the cell phones, we need to consider the interest charged on the initial purchase price. The interest rate is 2% per unit, and the cost of each cell phone is $150.

The interest for each unit can be calculated as 2% of $150, which is 0.02 x $150 = $3. 

The total amount Shiela will pay for each cell phone per month is the sum of the cost and the interest, which is $150 + $3 = $153.

Since Shiela bought 5 cell phones, the total amount she will pay each month is 5 x $153 = $765.

The answer is: $765"
"To calculate Artie's total revenue, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. 

First, we multiply the quantity of each type of flower by its respective price and then sum the results.

Marigolds: 12 pots * $2.74 = $32.88
Rounded to the nearest dollar: $33

Petunias: 9 pots * $1.87 = $16.83
Rounded to the nearest dollar: $17

Begonias: 17 pots * $2.12 = $35.64
Rounded to the nearest dollar: $36

Total revenue = $33 + $17 + $36 = $86

The final answer is: $86"
"The problem at hand involves a geometric sequence, where each term is half the preceding term. Given that the top level of the sandcastle has a square footage of 16, we can express this as a geometric sequence with the first term (a) being 16 and the common ratio (r) being 1/2.

The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is: an = a * r^(n-1)

We are interested in finding the average of the four levels, which can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum of the series, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 16, r = 1/2, and n = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = 16 * (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2)
S = 16 * (1 - 1/16) / (1/2)
S = 16 * (15/16) / (1/2)
S = 16 * (15/16) * 2
S = 30

To find the average, we divide the sum by the number of terms:

Average = S / n
Average = 30 / 4
Average = 7.5

Therefore, the average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"To determine the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days and the rest of her life.

The puppy will be fed 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. This can be calculated as:

1 * 180 = 180 cups

After the first 180 days, the puppy will be 1 year old, and Cecilia will feed it 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the total amount of dog food used in the rest of the year is:

2 * 365 = 730 cups

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is the sum of these two amounts:

180 + 730 = 910 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags used in the first year is:

910 cups / 110 cups per bag = 8.2727 (round up to 9 bags, since you can't buy a fraction of a bag)

Therefore, Cecilia will use 9 bags of dog food in the first year.

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as 'd', the amount of laundry Sarah does as 's', and the amount of laundry Raymond does as 'r'.

We are given that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so we can write an equation:

s = 4d

We are also given that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so we can write another equation:

r = s/2

Since we know Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find David's laundry:

400 = 4d
d = 400/4
d = 100

Now that we have David's laundry, we can find Raymond's laundry by substituting the value of 'd' into the second equation:

r = s/2
r = 400/2
r = 200

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:

Difference = r - d
= 200 - 100
= 100

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the more cost-effective option for purchasing 18 flowers, we must analyze the pricing structure of both options.

The first option involves purchasing flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50. To calculate the cost of 18 flowers, we can use the following formula:

Cost = (Number of flowers / Package size) * Package price
Cost = (18 / 3) * $2.50
Cost = 6 * $2.50
Cost = $15

The second option involves purchasing flowers in packages of 2 for $1. To calculate the cost of 18 flowers, we can use the following formula:

Cost = (Number of flowers / Package size) * Package price
Cost = (18 / 2) * $1
Cost = 9 * $1
Cost = $9

Comparing the costs, we can see that purchasing flowers in packages of 2 for $1 is the more cost-effective option, as it results in a lower total cost of $9 compared to $15.

The amount of money saved by choosing the better option is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To calculate the cost of the grooming after the discount, we can apply the concept of percentage decrease. The discount offered is 30% of the original cost, which can be represented as 0.3 in decimal form.

Original cost = $100
Discount = 0.3 x $100 = $30

To find the cost after the discount, we subtract the discount from the original cost:

Cost after discount = Original cost - Discount
= $100 - $30
= $70

Therefore, the grooming cost after the discount is $70."
"To determine the amount of water left, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we calculate the total amount of water the two girls received. Since each girl received 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can express this as a fraction and then convert it to a decimal or perform the division to find the amount each girl received. 

24 liters * (1/6) = 24/6 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, we multiply the amount each girl received by 2:
4 liters * 2 = 8 liters

Next, we add the 6 liters the boy received to the total amount the girls received:
8 liters + 6 liters = 14 liters

Now, we subtract the total amount of water given from the initial 24 liters to find the amount left:
24 liters - 14 liters = 10 liters

Therefore, there are 10 liters of water left.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the number of stickers Charlie has left, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers. He then acquired 21 more stickers from a store and received 23 stickers as a birthday gift. This results in a total of 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers.

Next, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister, leaving him with 54 - 9 = 45 stickers. Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, which reduces his total to 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we can follow a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to calculate Alex's weight by multiplying Grace's weight by 4 and then subtracting 2. 

Let's denote Grace's weight as G and Alex's weight as A. We know that G = 125 pounds. 

A = 4G - 2
A = 4(125) - 2
A = 500 - 2
A = 498 pounds

Now, we can find their combined weight by adding G and A:
Combined weight = G + A
Combined weight = 125 + 498
Combined weight = 623 pounds

The final answer is 623."
"To calculate the total number of thorns, we can employ the fundamental principles of arithmetic multiplication. 

We are given the following information:
- Number of rose bushes: 3
- Number of roses per bush: 25
- Number of thorns per rose: 8

Using the associative property of multiplication, we can rearrange the expression to facilitate easier calculation: (3 * 25) * 8.

First, we multiply 3 and 25: 3 * 25 = 75.

Next, we multiply the result by 8: 75 * 8 = 600.

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600.

The final answer is: $\boxed{600}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of games lost as x. Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the number of games won and lost is 22. This can be expressed as:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Now that we have found the value of x, we can determine the number of games won by substituting x into the expression x + 8:

Number of games won = x + 8
= 7 + 8
= 15

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the total number of quilt blocks, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Since Gene goes on four vacations per year and has been vacationing for 11 years, we can calculate the total number of blocks by multiplying the number of years by the number of vacations per year.

Let's apply the formula: Total blocks = Number of years * Number of vacations per year
Total blocks = 11 years * 4 vacations/year
Total blocks = 44

Therefore, Gene has a total of 44 quilt blocks.

Final answer: 44"
"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we can analyze the given information as follows:

Let's denote the duration of the first ring as x. According to the problem, the second ring lasted 3 times as long, so its duration is 3x. The third ring lasted half as long as the second ring, so its duration is (3x)/2.

We are given that the first ring lasted 4 times, so we can set up the equation: x = 4.

Now, we can find the duration of each ring:
- The first ring lasted 4 times.
- The second ring lasted 3x = 3(4) = 12 times.
- The third ring lasted (3x)/2 = (3(4))/2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add the durations of all three rings: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

Therefore, the alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we can apply the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) formula. 

The initial salary is $600, and the annual increase is 10% of the previous year's salary. 

Year 1: 
Salary after 1 year = $600 + (10% of $600) = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2: 
Salary after 2 years = $660 + (10% of $660) = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3: 
Salary after 3 years = $726 + (10% of $726) = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4: 
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + (10% of $798.60) = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5: 
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + (10% of $878.46) = $878.46 + $87.84 = $966.30

Year 6: 
Salary after 6 years = $966.30 + (10% of $966.30) = $966.30 + $96.63 = $1062.93

Year 7: 
Salary after 7 years = $1062.93 + (10% of $1062.93) = $1062.93 + $106.29 = $1169.22

Year 8: 
Salary after 8 years = $1169.22 + (10% of $1169.22) = $1169.22 + $116.92 = $1286.14

Year 9: 
Salary after 9 years = $1286.14 + (10% of $1286.14) = $1286.14 + $128.61 = $1414.75

Year 10: 
Salary after 10 years = $1414.75 + (10% of $1414.75) = $1414.75 + $141.48 = $1556.23

The final answer is: $1556.23"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as x. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, we can express the number of copies Marilyn sold as 10x.

We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can write the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 88,000 / 11
x = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is 8,000."
"To determine the number of gift bags needed, we must first calculate the fraction of attendees who will attend. Since 1/4 of the guests do not show up, the fraction of attendees is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.

Now, we multiply the fraction of attendees by the number of guests to find the total number of attendees: (3/4) * 16 = 12.

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can express this as a fraction: 3/4. To find the total number of gift bags needed, we multiply the number of attendees by this fraction: 12 * (3/4) = 9.

The cost of the gift bags is $2 each, so the total cost is 9 * $2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad required, we must consider the eating habits of both adults and children. 

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults. Since each adult consumes 10 pounds, we multiply the number of adults by this amount: 20 adults * 10 pounds/adult = 200 pounds.

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children. Given that children eat half as much as adults, we multiply the number of children by 5 pounds (half of 10 pounds): 5 children * 5 pounds/child = 25 pounds.

To find the total amount of potato salad required, we add the amounts for adults and children: 200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to ensure everyone has enough to eat.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To solve this problem, we can represent the number of pets each person has with variables. Let's denote the number of pets Cindy has as 'c', Marcia has as 'm', and Jan has as 'j'. We are given that Cindy has 4 pets, so c = 4.

We are also given that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so we can express this as m = c + 2. Substituting c = 4 into this equation, we get m = 4 + 2 = 6.

Furthermore, we know that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so we can express this as j = 3m. Substituting m = 6 into this equation, we get j = 3(6) = 18.

To find the total number of pets, we can add the number of pets each person has: total = c + m + j = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28.

Therefore, the total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we can represent the ages of the children as variables: let A = Amy's age, J = Jackson's age, C = Corey's age, and J = James' age.

We are given the following information:

1. J = 10 (James' age)
2. C = J + 1 (James is 1 year younger than Corey)
3. C = A + 2 (Amy is 2 years younger than Corey)
4. A = J + 5 (Amy is 5 years older than Jackson)

We can substitute the expression for C from equation (2) into equation (3) to get:

A = (J + 1) + 2
A = J + 3

Now, we can substitute the expression for A from equation (4) into the previous equation:

J + 3 = J + 5

Subtracting J from both sides gives us:

3 = 5

This is a contradiction, indicating that the given information is inconsistent. However, we can use the original equations to find the ages of the children.

From equation (2), we know C = J + 1. Substituting J = 10, we get C = 10 + 1 = 11.

From equation (4), we know A = J + 5. Substituting J = 10, we get A = 10 + 5 = 15.

Now that we have the ages of Amy and Corey, we can find Jackson's age using equation (4):

J = A - 5
J = 15 - 5
J = 10

However, we are given that J = 10, which is consistent with our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of percentage increase. Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x'. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's time is x + 2. We know that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 38

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

x = 36

Now, we need to find 10% of Gerald's original time. To calculate this, we can multiply his original time by 0.1:

0.1x = 0.1(36) = 3.6

Adding this to his original time, we get:

x + 0.1x = 36 + 3.6 = 39.6

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds.

The final answer is: 39.6"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of rabbits as R.

We are given that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so we can write an equation:

R = D + C - 12

We are also given that there are two cats for every dog, so we can write another equation:

C = 2D

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get:

R = D + 2D - 12
R = 3D - 12

We are also given that the number of dogs is 60, so we can substitute D = 60 into the equation:

R = 3(60) - 12
R = 180 - 12
R = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = D + C + R
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

The final answer is: $\boxed{348}$"
"To determine the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to calculate the total number of girls in the class. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls.

Total students = 200
Number of boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - (2/3 * 120)
= 120 - 80
= 40

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40."
"To determine the difference in hours slept between Harry and James, we can calculate the hours James slept by multiplying Harry's hours by the fraction 2/3.

Let's denote Harry's hours as H and James' hours as J. We know that H = 9 and J = (2/3)H.

J = (2/3)H
J = (2/3)(9)
J = 6

Now, we can find the difference in hours slept between Harry and James by subtracting James' hours from Harry's hours.

Difference = H - J
Difference = 9 - 6
Difference = 3

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To determine the number of tomatoes used, we must first calculate the total volume of tomatoes that Freda started with. Since she lost half of the volume when cooking the sauce, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Let x be the total number of 16-ounce cans of tomatoes used. Since she lost half of the volume, the amount of sauce produced is half of the total volume of tomatoes. We know that the resulting sauce weighs 32 ounces.

The total volume of tomatoes is 3 times the number of cans used (since each can contains 3 tomatoes), so we can write the equation:

3x = 32

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 32 ÷ 3
x = 10.67

Since we can't use a fraction of a can, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we're interested in the total number of tomatoes, not the number of cans. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans by 3:

Number of tomatoes = 10.67 × 3
Number of tomatoes ≈ 32

However, since we can't have a fraction of a tomato, we should re-evaluate our approach. Let's re-examine the problem. We know that the resulting sauce weighs 32 ounces, and each can of tomatoes weighs 16 ounces. Since she lost half of the volume, the amount of sauce produced is half of the total volume of tomatoes. We can set up a proportion to represent the situation:

(3x) / 2 = 32 / 16

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and simplify:

3x = 2 × 32
3x = 64
x = 64 / 3
x = 21.33

Since we can't use a fraction of a can, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, we're interested in the total number of tomatoes, not the number of cans. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans by 3:

Since she lost half of the volume, the amount of sauce produced is half of the total volume of tomatoes. We can set up a proportion to represent the situation:

(3x) / 2 = 32 / 16

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and simplify:

3x = 2 × 32
3x = 64
x = 64 / 3
x = 21.33

Since we can't use a fraction of a can, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, we're interested in the total number of tomatoes, not the number of cans. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans by 3:

Number of tomatoes = 21.33 × 3

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as x.

We know that the total number of cars is 30, and 5 cars took an exit. So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = x.

Simplifying the equation, we get x = 5.

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

Final Answer: The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of potted plants Mary initially has by multiplying the number of plants per ledge by the total number of ledges. This yields:

2 * 40 = 80

Next, we add the number of new plants she received to the initial total:

80 + 18 = 98

Finally, we subtract the number of plants she plans to give away from the total:

98 - 40 = 58

Therefore, Mary will have 58 potted plants left.

The final answer is 58."
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, we can express this as 20 + (1/4 * 20). To calculate 1/4 of 20, we multiply 20 by 1/4, which is equivalent to 20 * 0.25 = 5. Therefore, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings:
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To determine the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we must first calculate the sum of the pages from all the textbooks. This can be achieved by adding the individual page counts:

4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total to find the remaining pages:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Now, to find the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days he has left:

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

Therefore, Solo needs to read 6 pages per day to complete his reading within the given timeframe."
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the number of glasses John drinks on weekdays. Since he consumes 1 glass of water per meal, and he has 3 meals per day, the total number of glasses on weekdays is 3 * 5 = 15.

Next, we consider the weekend. On Saturday, John drinks 1 glass of water, and on Sunday, he drinks 0 glasses of water. Therefore, the total number of glasses on weekends is 1.

Now, we add the number of glasses consumed on weekdays and weekends to obtain the total number of glasses John drinks in a week. 

Total glasses of water = glasses on weekdays + glasses on weekends
Total glasses of water = 15 + 1
Total glasses of water = 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the time it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can apply the concept of unit rates. The given information states that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We can express this as a unit rate of 3 miles per 10 minutes.

To find the time it takes to cover 42 miles, we can set up a proportion:

(3 miles / 10 minutes) = (42 miles / x minutes)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

3x = 42 * 10
3x = 420

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 420 / 3
x = 140

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the number of jigsaw pieces left, we can use the concept of fractions and subtraction. 

Poppy initially places a quarter of the 1000 pieces on the board, which is equivalent to 1000 * 1/4 = 250 pieces. 

The remaining pieces are then 1000 - 250 = 750.

Next, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces, which is 750 * 1/3 = 250 pieces.

To find the number of pieces left, we subtract the pieces placed by Poppy's mom from the remaining pieces: 750 - 250 = 500.

Therefore, there are 500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.

The final answer is 500."
"To determine the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Given that Cody consumes three times the amount of cookies as Amir, we can express this relationship as a ratio: 3:1. 

Since Amir consumes 5 cookies, we can calculate Cody's consumption by multiplying Amir's amount by 3: 5 * 3 = 15 cookies. 

Now, we can find the total number of cookies eaten by adding Amir's and Cody's consumption: 5 + 15 = 20 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total inner volume of the boxes, we must first determine the inner dimensions of each box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from the outer dimensions to obtain the inner dimensions.

The inner dimensions of each box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the box) is given by the formula:
V = Length x Width x Height

Substituting the inner dimensions, we get:
V = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total Volume = 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we must first calculate the total time spent watching TV on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes, totaling 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

The total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent watching on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Converting 1.5 hours to minutes yields 90 minutes.

Dividing 90 minutes by 30 minutes results in 3.

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes each on Wednesday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

This year, Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he bakes 2x cookies. However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, resulting in a total of 2x + 15 cookies.

After dropping 5 cookies, Henry is left with 2x + 15 - 5 cookies. We are given that this total is equal to 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides yields:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we can employ the concept of subtraction. 

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is calculated as follows:

10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, it is:

10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Subtracting the cashback amount from the total cost yields:

$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

Therefore, the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we must first calculate the total number of roll-ups they consumed. 

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 * 24 = 48
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 * 14 = 42

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can divide the total by 2 to find the average number of roll-ups they ate.

Average number of roll-ups = Total number of roll-ups / 2
Average number of roll-ups = 90 / 2
Average number of roll-ups = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the amount of water the boat took on, we need to calculate the total distance Julia rowed and then find the corresponding amount of water taken on.

First, we can find the rate at which Julia rows by dividing the distance she rowed (20 feet) by the time it took her to row that distance (16 seconds):

Rate = Distance / Time = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can find the rate at which water is taken on by dividing 2 liters by 10 feet:

Rate of water taken on = 2 liters / 10 feet = 0.2 liters/foot

Now, we can find the total amount of water taken on by multiplying the rate of water taken on by the total distance Julia rowed (64 feet):

Total water taken on = Rate of water taken on x Total distance = 0.2 liters/foot x 64 feet = 12.8 liters

The final answer is: $\boxed{12.8}$"
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can apply the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

We are given the following parameters:
- Number of teachers: 4
- Number of lessons per day: 2
- Number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson: 3

Using the multiplication principle, we can calculate the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day as follows:

Total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day = Number of teachers × Number of lessons per day × Number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson
= 4 × 2 × 3
= 24

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"To calculate the total number of flowers Ryan has after 15 days, we can utilize the concept of multiplication and subtraction. 

First, we multiply the number of flowers planted per day (2) by the number of days (15) to determine the total number of flowers that would have grown if all of them were successful. This can be represented as:

2 flowers/day * 15 days = 30 flowers

However, we are informed that 5 flowers did not grow. To find the actual number of flowers Ryan has, we need to subtract the number of non-growing flowers from the total:

30 flowers - 5 flowers = 25 flowers

Therefore, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden after 15 days.

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as 'x'. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can express this relationship as an equation:

6x = 1800

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:

x = 1800 / 6
x = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. We can represent this relationship as another equation:

x = 50y

where 'y' is the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Since we already know that x = 300, we can substitute this value into the equation:

300 = 50y

To solve for 'y', we can divide both sides of the equation by 50:

y = 300 / 50
y = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To calculate the profit, we need to first determine the total cost of the lumber. The 2 x 4 x 10 boards cost $10 each, and there are 10 of them, so the total cost is 10 * $10 = $100. The 4 x 4 x 10 boards cost $16 each, and there are 5 of them, so the total cost is 5 * $16 = $80. The total cost is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 * $15 = $150. The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120. The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio of 7:13. Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as 'x'. Since the total amount of water is not required, we can directly focus on the sugar.

The ratio of sugar to total parts is 7:20. We know that the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons. 

We can set up the proportion as follows:

7/20 = 120/x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

7x = 20 * 120
7x = 2400

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 2400 / 7
x = 342.86 (approximately)

Since we are dealing with a ratio, we can express the answer as a fraction or round it to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can round to the nearest whole number.

The final answer is: $\boxed{343}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we can utilize the fundamental principles of arithmetic. Specifically, we will employ the multiplication operation to determine the total expenditure.

Let's break down the problem:

Number of pairs of shoes per child: 2
Cost per pair: $60
Number of children: 3

We can express this as a mathematical expression: 2 × 3 × $60

Using the associative property of multiplication, we can rearrange the expression to: 2 × (3 × $60)

Now, we can calculate the result of the expression inside the parentheses: 3 × $60 = $180

Finally, we multiply the result by 2: 2 × $180 = $360

Therefore, the total cost is $360."
"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we can utilize the concept of set theory and basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the initial number of containers as C1 and the number of vehicles in each container as V. We are given that C1 = 2 and V = 5.

The total number of vehicles after the second day can be represented as the sum of the vehicles from the initial containers and the vehicles from the additional containers. Let's denote the number of additional containers as C2. The total number of vehicles after the second day is given as 30.

We can set up the following equation:

C1 * V + C2 * V = 30

Substituting the given values, we get:

2 * 5 + C2 * 5 = 30

Simplifying the equation, we get:

10 + 5C2 = 30

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get:

5C2 = 20

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

C2 = 4

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

The final answer is 4."
"To calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later, we need to determine their individual salaries first.

Given that Adrien's salary was $40,000 four years ago and increased by 30%, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current Adrien's salary = Old Adrien's salary + 30% of Old Adrien's salary
= $40,000 + 0.30($40,000)
= $40,000 + $12,000
= $52,000

Next, we can find Lylah's salary four years ago using the equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + 0.30(Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.30(Lylah's salary)
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.30
= $30,769.23

Now, we can calculate Lylah's current salary by adding 40% of her old salary to her old salary:

Current Lylah's salary = Old Lylah's salary + 40% of Old Lylah's salary
= $30,769.23 + 0.40($30,769.23)
= $30,769.23 + $12,307.69
= $43,076.92

The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is the sum of their current salaries:
Total salary = Current Adrien's salary + Current Lylah's salary
= $52,000 + $43,076.92
= $95,076.92

The final answer is: $95,076.92"
"To determine the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we can employ a straightforward multiplication of the number of pads used per week by the number of weeks in a month. 

Given that Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the total number of sheets used as follows:

2 pads/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 pads/month

Since each pad contains 30 sheets of paper, we can further multiply the number of pads used per month by the number of sheets per pad:

8 pads/month * 30 sheets/pad = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"To determine the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought, we can use the following arithmetic calculations:

Let's denote the number of apples Morisette brought as A and the number of oranges she brought as O. We know that Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so A = 5 and O = 8.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples, which is 2A, and half the number of oranges, which is O/2. Therefore, the total number of fruits Kael brought is 2A + O/2.

The total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought together is A + O + 2A + O/2. We can simplify this expression by combining like terms:

A + O + 2A + O/2 = 3A + 1.5O

Substituting the values of A and O, we get:

3(5) + 1.5(8) = 15 + 12 = 27

Therefore, the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought together is 27.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To calculate the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we can break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, we establish the number of hours she slept on Monday, which is given as 8 hours. 

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so we subtract 2 hours from Monday's total for Tuesday and Wednesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours for Tuesday and 6 - 2 = 4 hours for Wednesday.

The rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days. So, for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, we add 1 hour to the previous day's total: 6 + 1 = 7 hours for Thursday, 7 + 1 = 8 hours for Friday, 8 + 1 = 9 hours for Saturday, and 9 + 1 = 10 hours for Sunday.

Now, we add up the hours for each day to find the total: 8 + 6 + 4 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 48 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours separately and then sum them up.

The distance covered in the first 3 hours is calculated as:
Distance = Speed × Time
= 10 miles/hour × 3 hours
= 30 miles

The distance covered in the remaining 4 hours is calculated as:
Distance = Speed × Time
= 5 miles/hour × 4 hours
= 20 miles

The total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is the sum of the distances covered in the two parts:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
= 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters as x.

We know that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, which is 60. This can be expressed as:

(1/3) * 60 = 20 letters

Since Jennie put stamps on 20 letters, the remaining letters in the pile of already-stamped letters are:

x - 20

We are also given that the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after Jennie put stamps on 20 letters is 30. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x - 20 = 30

To solve for x, we can add 20 to both sides of the equation:

x = 30 + 20
x = 50

So, there were 50 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia initially bought as x. We know that her husband gave her 5 spoons, and she used 3 spoons to sample her stew. The total number of spoons she had at the end is 12. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides yields:

x = 10

Therefore, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we can utilize the concept of addition. Given that he purchased 38 chicken sausages and 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Number of fish sausages = Number of chicken sausages + 6
Number of fish sausages = 38 + 6
Number of fish sausages = 44

Now, we can calculate the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages:

Total number of sausages = Number of chicken sausages + Number of fish sausages
Total number of sausages = 38 + 44
Total number of sausages = 82

Therefore, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages."
"To determine the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together, we can utilize the concept of addition. 

Given that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, we can express this relationship as an equation: 

Let's denote the number of friends Lily has as L and the number of friends Amy has as A. We know that A = L + 20. 

We are also given that L = 50. Substituting this value into the equation A = L + 20, we get A = 50 + 20 = 70.

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Amy and Lily have: A + L = 70 + 50 = 120.

Therefore, the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together is 120."
"To determine the total cost of the items Dillon is buying, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of a pepper as P, the cost of a watermelon as W, and the cost of an orange as O.

We know that a watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs, so W = 3P. We also know that an orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, so O = W - 5.

Given that each pepper costs 15$, we can substitute P = 15 into the equation for the cost of a watermelon: W = 3(15) = 45$.

Now, we can find the cost of an orange: O = W - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40$.

The total cost of the items Dillon is buying can be represented by the equation: Total Cost = (4W) + (20P) + (10O).

Substituting the values we found earlier, we get: Total Cost = (4 * 45) + (20 * 15) + (10 * 40) = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$.

Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is 880$."
"To calculate the profit, we need to consider the total time spent on patients and the revenue generated from both the hospital and the patients.

First, let's convert the total time spent on patients to hours: 500 people * 24 minutes/person = 12,000 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to hours by dividing by 60: 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours.

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, so the total revenue from patients is 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000. The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total revenue from doctors is 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from patients and doctors: $40,000 + $30,000 = $70,000.

The total cost is the sum of the revenue from doctors, as the hospital does not charge patients: $30,000.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost: $70,000 - $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To determine the number of elves left, we can break down the problem into two steps. 

First, we calculate the number of elves that quit after children vomit on them. This is equivalent to one-third of the total number of elves, which is 60. 

60 ÷ 3 = 20

So, 20 elves quit due to the incident. The remaining number of elves is then 60 - 20 = 40.

Next, we subtract the elves that quit after kids kick their shins. 

40 - 10 = 30

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30."
"To calculate the total expenditure, we can simply add the expenditures for May and June. 

Expenditure in May = $500
Expenditure in June = $500 - $60 = $440

Total expenditure = $500 + $440 = $940

Therefore, the total expenditure for those two months is $940."
"To calculate the total number of tickets used, we can break down the problem into two parts: the roller coaster rides and the luge rides.

First, let's calculate the total number of tickets used for the roller coaster rides. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, and each ride costs 6 tickets. Therefore, the total number of tickets used for the roller coaster rides is 2 * 6 = 12.

Next, let's calculate the total number of tickets used for the luge rides. Both Pam and Fred rode the luge 2 times, so the total number of tickets used for the luge rides is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.

Now, we can add the total number of tickets used for the roller coaster rides and the luge rides to find the overall total. 12 + 8 = 20.

Therefore, the total number of tickets used that day is 20."
"To determine the miles walked on Wednesday, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the miles walked on Monday as M, Tuesday as T, and Wednesday as W. We are given that M = 4 and T = 6M.

We also know that the total miles walked from Monday through Wednesday is 41. This can be expressed as:

M + T + W = 41

Substituting T = 6M into the equation, we get:

M + 6M + W = 41

Combine like terms:

7M + W = 41

Now, we can substitute M = 4 into the equation:

7(4) + W = 41

28 + W = 41

Subtract 28 from both sides:

W = 13

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

13"
"To calculate the total annual cost of car washes, we can utilize the formula for calculating total cost: Total Cost = Number of Car Washes per Month * Number of Months per Year * Cost per Car Wash.

In this scenario, Tom receives 4 car washes per month, and each car wash costs $15. By multiplying these values, we can determine the total annual cost.

Total Cost = 4 car washes/month * 12 months/year * $15/car wash
Total Cost = 4 * 12 * 15
Total Cost = 720

Therefore, Tom's annual car wash expenditure is $720."
"To determine the number of video games Bobby has, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of video games Brian has as B and the number of video games Bobby has as x.

We are told that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. This can be represented as:

x = 3B - 5

We are also given that Brian has 20 video games but lost 5 right before the comparison was made. Therefore, we can substitute B = 15 into the equation:

x = 3(15) - 5
x = 45 - 5
x = 40

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the number of female Scottish unicorns, we can apply the concept of proportional reasoning. Given that one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands and two thirds of those are female, we can calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns as follows:

Let's denote the total number of unicorns as T and the number of Scottish unicorns as S. We know that S = (1/3)T and that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns can be expressed as (2/3)S.

Substituting S = (1/3)T into the expression for the number of female Scottish unicorns, we get:

Number of female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) * (1/3)T
= (2/9)T

Given that T = 27, we can substitute this value into the expression:

Number of female Scottish unicorns = (2/9) * 27
= (2/9) * 27
= 6

Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is 6.

The final answer is 6."
"To calculate the total cost of Rory's order, we need to break down the components and apply the relevant arithmetic operations.

First, let's calculate the subtotal of the items: 2 subs at $7.50 each is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00, 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00, and 2 cookies at $1.00 each is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00. The subtotal is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

Next, we need to calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the subtotal. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20, resulting in $4.00.

Now, we add the delivery fee to the subtotal: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Finally, we add a $5.00 tip to the total: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To determine the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we must first calculate the total number of questions he completed in both tests. 

Mark completed 40 questions in the first test and 30 questions in the second test. The total number of questions completed is the sum of these two: 
40 + 30 = 70 questions

Since the first test had 75 questions, we subtract the total number of questions completed from the total number of questions in the first test to find the number of questions left incomplete: 
75 - 70 = 5 questions

Therefore, Mark left 5 questions incomplete."
"Let's analyze the given information. We are dealing with a linear relationship between the number of blue and pink gumballs. The problem states that the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

P = 4B + 22

where P represents the number of pink gumballs and B represents the number of blue gumballs.

We are given that the number of blue gumballs is 12. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

P = 4(12) + 22
P = 48 + 22
P = 70

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we can use the following formula:

Percentage = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100

Given that there are 20 cars in total, 12 are automatic, and 4 are manual, we can calculate the number of semi-automatic cars as follows:

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:

Percentage = (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of worker bees, baby bees, and queens.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W. We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write the equation:

W = 2B

We are also given that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write another equation:

B = 2Q

The total number of bees is 700, which is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens. Therefore, we can write the equation:

W + B + Q = 700

Substituting the expressions for W and B in terms of Q, we get:

2B + B + Q = 700

Combine like terms:

3B + Q = 700

Substitute B = 2Q:

3(2Q) + Q = 700

Expand and simplify:

6Q + Q = 700

Combine like terms:

7Q = 700

Divide both sides by 7:

Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:

B = 2Q
= 2(100)
= 200

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees:

W = 2B
= 2(200)
= 400

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400."

1. Calculate the total hours worked in a week: 2 hours/day × 7 days = 14 hours
2. Multiply the total hours worked by the hourly wage: 14 hours × $10/hour = $140

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working, he would earn $140 in a week."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first determine the subtotal for the non-food items and then apply the 10% tax.

The total cost of the non-food items is: $3 (light bulbs) + $3 (cups) + $4 (roach traps) = $10

To calculate the tax, we multiply the subtotal by the tax rate (10% or 0.10):
$10 * 0.10 = $1

Now, we add the tax to the subtotal:
$10 + $1 = $11

The total cost of the food items is $5 (milk) + $3 (eggs) = $8

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items (including tax):
$8 + $11 = $19

Therefore, the total cost of everything is $19.

The final answer is: $19"
"To calculate Kim's profit, we need to determine the total expenses and subtract it from his total income. 

Let's break down the costs:

- The cost of bleach per client is 2 bottles at $2 each, so the total cost of bleach for 8 clients is 2 * 8 * $2 = $32.
- The cost of cloths per client is 1 pack at $5 each, so the total cost of cloths for 8 clients is 8 * $5 = $40.

Total expenses = $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income:

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we must consider the conversion of the given units and the frequency of harvesting.

First, we need to convert the area from hectares to square meters, as the standard unit for measuring area in the International System of Units (SI). There are 10,000 square meters in one hectare. Therefore, 10 hectares is equivalent to 10,000 square meters.

Next, we can calculate the total number of pineapples per year by multiplying the area in square meters by the number of pineapples per square meter. However, we are not given the number of pineapples per square meter. We are given that there are 100 pineapples per hectare. To find the number of pineapples per square meter, we divide 100 pineapples/hectare by 10,000 square meters/hectare, which equals 0.01 pineapples/square meter.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pineapples per year by multiplying the area in square meters by the number of pineapples per square meter and then by the frequency of harvesting (4 times a year).

10,000 square meters * 0.01 pineapples/square meter * 4 = 400 pineapples/year

Therefore, John can harvest 400 pineapples within a year.

"To determine the total number of Lego pieces Johnny needs to pick up, we can calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box contains 500 pieces. The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, which can be expressed as 3 * 500. The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first box, which can be calculated as 1/4 * 500.

Using the rules of arithmetic, we can calculate the total number of pieces as follows:

500 + (3 * 500) + (1/4 * 500)

First, calculate the value of 3 * 500:
3 * 500 = 1500

Next, calculate the value of 1/4 * 500:
1/4 * 500 = 125

Now, add the values together:
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

Therefore, the total number of Lego pieces Johnny needs to pick up is 2125.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2125}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into three distinct phases, each with its own set of bee movements.

Phase 1: Initial Bee Departure (6 hours)
In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.

Phase 2: Bee Return and Second Departure (6 hours)
In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees. Then, 2 times as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Phase 3: Final Bee Return (6 hours)
The total number of bees that left in the first 2 periods is 30 + 60 = 90 bees. Since 15 bees had already returned, the number of bees that left in the first 2 periods and hadn't returned yet is 90 - 15 = 75 bees. In the last 6 hours, all the remaining bees that left in the first 2 periods return, which is 75 bees.

Therefore, Debra saw 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

Final answer: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we can use basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets. The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: 

Total Cost = Amount Given - Change

We know the total cost is $22 and the change is $8. Let's represent the amount given as 'x'. 

x - 8 = 22

To solve for 'x', we can add 8 to both sides of the equation:

x = 22 + 8
x = 30

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.

The final answer is $30."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of Dorothy's friends as 'D' and the number of James' friends as 'J'. We are given that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, so we can express this as:

Charlie's friends = 3D

We are also given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation:

3D = 12

To solve for D, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

D = 12/3
D = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' number of friends by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4:

J = 4D
J = 4(4)
J = 16

Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook.

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the time Tim will be waiting for Steve, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to cover their respective distances.

First, let's convert the distances to a common unit. Since the speeds are given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distances to feet.

Steve's distance: 3 miles × 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles × 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: t = d / r = 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: t = d / r = 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, we need to find the time difference between their times to determine how long Tim will be waiting for Steve.

Time Tim will be waiting: Δt = t_Tim - t_Steve = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to consider the cost of inflating the tires for each type of vehicle. 

First, let's calculate the cost for bicycles: 5 people * 2 tires * 25 cents = 5 * 2 * 0.25 = $1.25
Next, we calculate the cost for tricycles: 3 people * 3 tires * 25 cents = 3 * 3 * 0.25 = $2.25
Lastly, we calculate the cost for the unicycle: 1 person * 1 tire * 25 cents = 1 * 1 * 0.25 = $0.25

Now, let's add the amounts together: $1.25 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $3.75

The final answer is: $3.75"
"To calculate the change Carl receives after purchasing 10 packs of cookies, we must first determine the total cost of the cookies. Each pack contains 6 cookies, and each cookie costs $0.10. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total Cost = Number of Cookies * Cost per Cookie
Total Cost = 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack * $0.10/cookie
Total Cost = 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie
Total Cost = $6

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, the change can be calculated as follows:

Change = Amount Paid - Total Cost
Change = $10 - $6
Change = $4

"To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach to work backwards and determine the initial number of french fries in the pack.

Let's denote the initial number of french fries as 'x'. We know that the seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, which is 14. So, the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries.

After the seagull ate 7 fries, the remaining fries were 14 - 7 = 7.

Then, three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries. The remaining fries before the pigeons ate 7 + 9 = 16.

A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * 16 = 32/3. To find the remaining fries, we subtract 32/3 from 16: 16 - 32/3 = (48 - 32) / 3 = 16/3.

Since the raccoon ate 2/3 of the fries, the remaining fries before the raccoon ate 16/3 + 32/3 = 48/3 = 16.

We know that three pigeons ate 9 fries, so the remaining fries before the pigeons ate 16 + 9 = 25.

Finally, Dave ate 14 fries, so the initial number of fries in the pack is 25 + 14 = 39.

The final answer is: $\boxed{39}$"
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we can break down his class schedule into two categories: 1-hour classes and 2-hour classes.

Let's calculate the total hours spent on 1-hour classes. There are 3 days with 1-hour classes (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays), and each day has 3 classes. So, the total hours spent on 1-hour classes per week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours. Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours spent on 1-hour classes is 9 * 16 = 144 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total hours spent on 2-hour classes. There are 2 days with 2-hour classes (Tuesdays and Thursdays), and each day has 2 classes. So, the total hours spent on 2-hour classes per week is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours spent on 2-hour classes is 4 * 16 = 64 hours.

To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we add the hours spent on 1-hour classes and 2-hour classes: 144 + 64 = 208 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{208}$"
"To calculate the total length of the baked goods, we need to convert each type of baked good to a common unit, which is feet. 

First, we'll convert the length of each item to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- The length of the rolls is 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet.
- The length of the croissants is 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet.
- The length of the baguettes is 60 baguettes * 24 inches/foot * 2 feet/baguette = 288 feet.

Now, we add the lengths together: 10 feet + 10 feet + 288 feet = 308 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{308}$"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we must consider the monthly requirements of each ape species and then calculate the total for the desired time period.

First, let's calculate the monthly requirement for each species:
- Monkeys: 200 bananas/month
- Gorillas: 400 bananas/month
- Baboons: 100 bananas/month

To find the total requirement for 2 months, we multiply each monthly requirement by 2:
- Monkeys: 200 bananas/month * 2 months = 400 bananas
- Gorillas: 400 bananas/month * 2 months = 800 bananas
- Baboons: 100 bananas/month * 2 months = 200 bananas

Now, we add up the total requirements:
400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine the winner of the contest, we must calculate the total distance each individual ran.

Blake's distance can be calculated by multiplying the number of times he ran (15) by the length of the football field (100 yards): 15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards.

Kelly's distance can be calculated by first determining the total distance she ran back and forth on the entire field (100 yards * 2 = 200 yards) and then adding the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back (80 yards * 34 times = 2720 yards). Therefore, her total distance is 200 yards + 2720 yards = 2920 yards.

Since 2920 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 2920 yards - 1500 yards = 1420 yards.

The final answer is: 1420"

Let's break down the information:

- Initial tadpoles: 11
- Tadpoles that emerged from under a lily pad: +6
- Tadpoles that hid under a rock: -2

Using the principle of addition and subtraction, we can calculate the final count as follows:

11 (initial tadpoles) + 6 (tadpoles that emerged) - 2 (tadpoles that hid) = 15

Therefore, Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond.

Final Answer: The final answer is 15."
"To determine the water depth in the tank on Wednesday, we can apply the given information using basic arithmetic operations.

The tank initially had 17 feet of water on Monday. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet, resulting in a total of 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the water depth is two thirds of the depth on Tuesday. To find this, we multiply the depth on Tuesday (24 feet) by 2/3.

The calculation is: (2/3) * 24 = 16 feet.

Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"To determine the total number of fish caught, we can analyze the information provided.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which can be expressed as 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which can be expressed as 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Furthermore, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which can be expressed as 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:

Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

The total number of fish caught is the sum of their individual totals: 19 + 13 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"The exponential growth of the marble price can be modeled using the formula for compound interest, where the initial price (P) is $20, the monthly growth rate (r) is 20% or 0.20, and the number of periods (n) is 36 months. The formula for compound interest is:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where A is the final price.

Plugging in the values, we get:

A = 20(1 + 0.20)^36
A = 20(1.20)^36
A = 20(6.656)
A = 132.12

Rounded to two decimal places, the final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $132.12.

The final answer is $132.12."
"To determine the total cost of all toys, we can use the given information to establish the cost of each type of toy.

Let's denote the cost of an action figure as A, the cost of a red car as R, and the cost of the doll as D.

We are given that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so D = 3A.

We also know that one red car costs $4, so R = $4.

Additionally, we are given that an action figure costs $5, so A = $5.

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation D = 3A to find the cost of the doll:
D = 3 * $5
D = $15

Now, we can find the total cost of all toys:
Total cost = (number of red cars) * (cost of a red car) + (number of action figures) * (cost of an action figure) + (number of the doll) * (cost of the doll)
Total cost = 5 * $4 + 3 * $5 + 1 * $15
Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15
Total cost = $50

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the financial impact of hiring an accountant versus doing taxes oneself, we must consider the opportunity cost of Jackie's time and the cost of hiring a professional.

First, let's calculate the lost income due to the time spent on taxes. Assuming a 3-hour time commitment, and a lost income of $35 per hour, the total lost income is:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Next, we need to consider the cost of hiring an accountant, which is $90.

To find the net gain from hiring an accountant, we subtract the cost from the lost income:

$105 (lost income) - $90 (cost) = $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires an accountant.

Final answer: $15"
"To calculate the remaining amount for Elvira's clothing, we need to subtract the total cost of the computer accessories from her budget.

The total cost of the accessories can be calculated as follows:

€1090 (computer) + €157 (scanner) + €74 (CD burner) + €102 (printer) = €1423

To find the remaining amount, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:

€1500 (budget) - €1423 (total cost) = €77

Therefore, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

77"
"To determine the number of times Sandra needs to babysit, we can use simple division. The number of eggs required for 15 Spanish flans is 15, and she receives 3 eggs per babysitting session. 

We can express this as a division problem: 15 ÷ 3 = x, where x represents the number of babysitting sessions.

Simplifying the expression, we get:

15 ÷ 3 = 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to obtain the required eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Seth's current age as x. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Brooke's current age can be represented as x/2.

In 2 years, Seth's age will be x + 2, and Brooke's age will be x/2 + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 + x/2 + 2 = 28

To simplify the equation, we can first combine like terms:

(3x/2) + 4 = 28

Next, we'll subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the term with the variable:

3x/2 = 24

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 2:

3x = 48

Finally, we'll divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:

x = 16

Therefore, Seth's current age is 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To solve this problem, we can represent the amount of money Ethel has as 'E' and the amount of money Jimmy has as 'J'. We are given that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has, so we can write the equation:

J = 2E + 2

We are also given that Ethel has $8, so we can substitute E = 8 into the equation:

J = 2(8) + 2
J = 16 + 2
J = 18

Therefore, Jimmy has $18.

The final answer is 18."
"To calculate the total miles walked in a week, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic series. 

Let's break down the problem into two parts: weekdays and weekends. 

The number of weekdays is 5, and the miles walked on each weekday is 20. Therefore, the total miles walked on weekdays can be calculated as:

5 * 20 = 100

The number of weekends is 2, and the miles walked on each weekend day is 10. Therefore, the total miles walked on weekends can be calculated as:

2 * 10 = 20

Now, we can find the total miles walked in a week by adding the miles walked on weekdays and weekends:

100 + 20 = 120

Therefore, Pancho walks a total of 120 miles in a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we can break down the costs as follows:

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 × $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
$25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To calculate the total number of legs, we can employ the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

First, we'll calculate the total number of legs from the spiders. Since each spider has 8 legs, we can multiply the number of spiders (80) by 8 to obtain the total number of legs from spiders: 80 × 8 = 640.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of legs from the insects. Each insect has 6 legs, so we can multiply the number of insects (90) by 6 to obtain the total number of legs from insects: 90 × 6 = 540.

Lastly, we'll calculate the total number of legs from the rare mutant invertebrates. Each invertebrate has 10 legs, so we can multiply the number of invertebrates (3) by 10 to obtain the total number of legs from invertebrates: 3 × 10 = 30.

Now, we can add the total number of legs from each group together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210.

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To determine the total age of the four birds, we can represent their ages algebraically. Let's denote Sally Thirty-two's age as S32, Sally Four's age as S4, Granny Red's age as GR, and Sally Two's age as S2.

We are given that S32 = 8 and S4 = S32. We can substitute S32 into the equation for S4, so S4 = 8.

We also know that GR = 2 * S4. Substituting S4 = 8 into this equation, we get GR = 2 * 8 = 16.

Lastly, we are given that S2 = S32 + 3. Substituting S32 = 8 into this equation, we get S2 = 8 + 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages: S32 + S4 + GR + S2 = 8 + 8 + 16 + 11 = 43.

The total age of the four birds is 43."
"To determine the total annual payment, we must first calculate the total monthly payment. The minimum payment for each debt is as follows:

- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

Total minimum payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.5 x $1000 = $500

Now, we add the 50% increase to the total minimum payment:

$1000 + $500 = $1500

To find the total annual payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 x 12 = $18,000

Therefore, Jessica pays $18,000 per year."
"To calculate the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we can break down the process into two steps: peeling and cutting. 

First, we need to convert the time it takes to peel and cut each potato into a common unit, which is seconds. 

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Total time to prepare one potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Now, we multiply the total time to prepare one potato by the number of potatoes:
60 potatoes * 95 seconds/potato = 5700 seconds

To convert the total time to minutes for easier understanding:
5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy approximately 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

Final answer: 95"
"To determine the amount Juan and his brother Carlos spent on lemons, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of gallons as 'g'. Since they sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

The total revenue is then 10g. The cost of lemons and sugar for each gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. The total cost is then 5g. We are given that the profit is $25, so we can set up the equation:

10g - 5g = 25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

5g = 25

Dividing both sides by 5, we find:

g = 5

Since the cost of lemons and sugar for 1 gallon is $5, the total cost of lemons is 5 * 5 = $25.

The final answer is $25."
"To determine the number of Chinese girls, we must first calculate the total number of Chinese participants. This can be achieved by subtracting the number of Japanese participants from the total number of Asian participants.

Total Asian participants = 240
Number of Japanese participants = 80
Total Chinese participants = Total Asian participants - Number of Japanese participants
= 240 - 80
= 160

Now, we can find the number of Chinese girls by subtracting the number of Chinese boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of Chinese girls = Total Chinese participants - Number of Chinese boys
= 160 - 60
= 100

Therefore, the number of Chinese girls on the team is 100."
"To determine Zaid's remaining monthly income after all expenses and donations, we'll break down his expenditures and calculate the total amount spent.

Zaid's monthly income is 6000$. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is (1/4) * 6000 = 1500$. 

Next, he spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is (1/3) * 6000 = 2000$. 

The total amount spent so far is 1500 + 2000 = 3500$. 

The remaining amount is 6000 - 3500 = 2500$. 

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is (1/2) * 2500 = 1250$. 

The amount left after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250$. 

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount spent on these is 200 + 700 = 900$. 

The amount left after these expenses is 1250 - 900 = 350$.

Therefore, Zaid will have 350$ left after all his expenses and donations.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To solve this problem, we can represent the number of crabs each person has with variables. Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as B, Monic has as M, and Rani has as R.

We are given that B = 40 and M = B - 4. Substituting the value of B into the equation for M, we get M = 40 - 4 = 36.

We are also given that R = M + 10. Substituting the value of M into this equation, we get R = 36 + 10 = 46.

Now, we can add up the number of crabs each person has: B + M + R = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122.

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"To calculate Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks, we can apply the concept of linear multiplication. 

The total earnings for the first week can be calculated as 10 hours * $10/hour = $100. However, this is incorrect, as the problem states Lloyd tutored 5 hours for the first week, not 10. Therefore, the correct calculation for the first week is 5 hours * $10/hour = $50.

For the second week, Lloyd earned 8 hours * $10/hour = $80.

The total earnings for the first two weeks can be found by adding the earnings from both weeks: $50 + $80 = $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we can utilize the concept of complementary fractions. Since the winner garnered 3/4 of the total votes, the remaining fraction of the votes represents the portion allocated to the loser. 

We can express this as:

Number of votes the loser got = Total votes - Number of votes the winner got
= 80 - (3/4) * 80
= 80 - 60
= 20

Alternatively, we can also calculate the loser's votes by finding the complement of the winner's votes, which is 1 - 3/4 = 1/4. Then, we multiply this fraction by the total number of votes:

Number of votes the loser got = (1/4) * 80
= 20

Therefore, the number of votes the loser received is 20."
"To determine the number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses can be represented as 4x.

We are also given that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, which can be expressed as 5x. However, this information is not directly relevant to finding the number of red roses. The key piece of information is that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations.

Since we know that the total number of white carnations is 40 (as calculated earlier), we can find the number of red roses by multiplying 4 and 40.

Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To solve this problem, we can represent the ages of Jean, Mark, and Jan using variables. Let's denote Jean's age as J, Mark's age as M, and Jan's age as A.

We are given the following information:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark: J = M + 2
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age: M - 2 = (A/2) + 5

We are also given that Jan is 30 years old, so A = 30.

Substituting A = 30 into the second equation, we get:

M - 2 = (30/2) + 5
M - 2 = 15 + 5
M - 2 = 20
M = 22

Now that we have found Mark's age, we can find Jean's age using the first equation:

J = M + 2
J = 22 + 2
J = 24

Therefore, Jean is 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the time difference between the two teams, we need to calculate the total time for each team.

The less well-rounded team's total time can be calculated as follows:

Time = 60 + (60 - 3) + (60 - 2*3) + (60 - 3*3)
Time = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51
Time = 222 seconds

The well-rounded team's total time can be calculated as follows:

Time = 55 + 55 + 55 + 55
Time = 220 seconds

The time difference between the two teams is:
Time difference = 222 - 220
Time difference = 2 seconds

Therefore, the faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"When analyzing the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 versus rolling two even numbers in a row, we can approach this problem from a combinatorial perspective.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is equivalent to the ratio of favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) to the total number of possible outcomes (6). This can be expressed as:

P(number > 3) = 3/6 = 1/2

To calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we consider the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll (3/6) and then the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll (2/5, since one even number has already been rolled). This can be expressed as:

P(2 even numbers in a row) = (3/6) * (2/5) = 6/30 = 1/5

Now, we can find the difference in probability by subtracting the two probabilities:

P(number > 3) - P(2 even numbers in a row) = 1/2 - 1/5

To find a common denominator, we can multiply the first fraction by 5/5:

P(number > 3) - P(2 even numbers in a row) = (5/10) - (1/5) = (5/10) - (2/10) = 3/10

To express this as a percentage, we can multiply by 100:

(3/10) * 100% = 30%

Therefore, Jerry is 30% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30\%}$"
"To determine the total number of apples picked, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, we can express this relationship as a ratio. Let's denote the number of apples picked by Jenna's mother as 'm' and the number of apples picked by Jenna as 'j'. The given information states that Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, so m = 20.

We can express the relationship between the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother as:

j = (1/2)m

Substituting the value of m, we get:

j = (1/2)(20)
j = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked, we add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother:

Total apples = j + m
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

Therefore, the total number of apples picked is 30."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'x'. Since there are 3 cages, the total number of rats is 3x.

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for rats is 6(3x) = 18x.

We know that the total number of straw used for rats is 90, so we can set up the equation:

18x = 90

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 18:

x = 90/18

x = 5

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the interest, we can use the formula for simple interest:

I = P * r * t

where:
I = interest
P = principal amount ($100)
r = monthly interest rate (2% = 0.02)
t = time in months (3)

I = $100 * 0.02 * 3
I = $6

The total interest earned over 3 months is $6. To find the amount Mandy should pay, we add the interest to the principal:

Amount to be paid = Principal + Interest
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6
Amount to be paid = $106

Therefore, Mandy should pay $106 to Benedict."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as x.

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold, which is 30x. The total cost is the cost of buying the bags plus the cost of transportation, which is 20x + 2x = 22x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:

30x - 22x = 400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8x = 400

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

x = 400 / 8
x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total cost of the outing, we must first calculate the cost of the food. Since the friends spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets, we can find the cost of the food by subtracting $4.50 from the cost of the tickets.

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. The cost of each ride is $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost of the rides is:

Total cost of rides = 2 * $33
Total cost of rides = $66

Now, we can find the total cost of all expenses by adding the cost of the tickets, food, and rides:

Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To calculate the total number of peaches John collects, we can utilize the fundamental principles of unit conversion and multiplication.

First, we convert the time from hours to minutes, as the rate of peach collection is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equivalent to 3 × 60 = 180 minutes.

Next, we multiply the time in minutes by the rate of peach collection per minute: 180 minutes × 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the daily insect requirement for a flock of ten ducks, we can utilize the concept of proportional reasoning. Given that the ducks need 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we can divide this amount by 7 to obtain the daily requirement.

Insects per day = Total amount of insects per week / Number of days in a week
Insects per day = 3.5 / 7
Insects per day = 0.5 pounds

Therefore, the ducks require 0.5 pounds of insects per day to sustain themselves."
"To determine the number of trees Tom has left, we can break down the problem into three stages: planting, chopping, and mortality.

First, we calculate the net gain of trees per year by subtracting the number of trees chopped from the number of trees planted:

Net gain per year = 10 trees (planted) - 2 trees (chopped) = 8 trees/year

Since Tom plants 10 trees per year for 10 years, the total number of trees planted is:

10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees

Next, we calculate the total number of trees after 10 years, considering the net gain:

100 trees + 8 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees + 80 trees = 180 trees

Now, we calculate 30% of the total number of trees that die:

0.3 * 180 trees = 54 trees

Finally, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years:

180 trees - 54 trees = 126 trees

The final answer is: $\boxed{126}$"
"To determine the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. This leaves 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To calculate the change Violetta will receive, we must first determine the total cost of the crayons. Since she requires 5 crayons at $2 each, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total Cost = Number of Crayons * Cost per Crayon
Total Cost = 5 * $2
Total Cost = $10

Now, we can calculate the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount Violetta has:

Change = Amount Violetta has - Total Cost
Change = $20 - $10
Change = $10

Therefore, Violetta will receive $10 in change."
"The cost of a pen is determined by adding the cost of a pencil and an eraser. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, we can calculate the cost of a pen as follows:

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
= $1.20 + $0.30
= $1.50

To find the cost of 8 pens, we can multiply the cost of a single pen by 8:

Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50
= $12.00

Therefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00."
"To determine the amount of carrots that will not be used, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. Since each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, we can calculate the total amount distributed by multiplying the number of restaurants by the amount each receives.

Total amount of carrots distributed = Number of restaurants * Amount per restaurant
= 40 * 2
= 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available to find the amount that will not be used.

Amount of carrots not used = Total amount of carrots available - Total amount of carrots distributed
= 200 - 80
= 120 pounds

Therefore, the amount of carrots that will not be used is 120 pounds."
"To determine the number of children in Soda, we can utilize the principle of set theory, specifically the concept of complementary counting. This involves subtracting the sum of the number of men and women from the total population to obtain the number of children.

Let's apply this principle:

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Using the formula for complementary counting:

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)
= 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
= 23786 - 17509
= 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into three steps, each representing a month.

Let's denote the initial number of cards as x. In the first month, Elaine collected 3 times the initial number of cards, which is 3x. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month, which is 3x - 20. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months, which is 2(3x + (3x - 20)).

Now, let's simplify the expression for the third month: 2(3x + 3x - 20) = 2(6x - 20) = 12x - 40.

The total number of cards Elaine has now is the sum of the cards she collected each month: x + 3x + (3x - 20) + (12x - 40). Combining like terms, we get 19x - 60.

We know that Elaine initially had 20 cards, so x = 20. Substituting this value into the expression, we get 19(20) - 60 = 380 - 60 = 320.

Therefore, Elaine now has 320 cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{320}$"
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A as x. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, the number of sentences for Publisher B is also x.

We know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount Mark earns from Publisher A is 5x cents. Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B is 2(5x) = 10x cents.

The total number of sentences Mark edits is 1000, so we can set up the equation:

x + x = 1000

Combine like terms:

2x = 1000

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 500

Now that we know Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher, we can calculate his earnings from each publisher:

Earnings from Publisher A: 5x = 5(500) = 2500 cents
Earnings from Publisher B: 10x = 10(500) = 5000 cents

To find Mark's total weekly earnings, we add the earnings from both publishers:

Total earnings = 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents

The final answer is 7500."
"To calculate the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we can employ the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

First, we need to determine the total number of pails of water Baldur receives in a day. This can be achieved by adding the number of pails he receives in the morning to the number of pails he receives in the afternoon.

Total pails per day = Morning pails + Afternoon pails
Total pails per day = 5 + 6
Total pails per day = 11

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, we can then multiply the total number of pails by the volume of each pail to obtain the total amount of water Baldur receives in a day.

Total liters per day = Total pails per day * Volume per pail
Total liters per day = 11 * 5
Total liters per day = 55

Therefore, Baldur receives 55 liters of water every day."
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary. The raise is a 5% increase in his weekly salary, which is $2000. 

First, let's calculate the raise amount:
5% of $2000 = 0.05 * $2000 = $100

Now, we can calculate his new weekly salary:
$2000 + $100 = $2100

Next, we multiply the new weekly salary by the number of weeks in a year:
$2100 * 52 = $109,200

Finally, we add the monetary reward:
$109,200 + $5,000 = $114,200

Therefore, John's total earnings for the year would be $114,200.

Final answer: $114,200"
"The problem at hand involves a straightforward application of arithmetic operations. To determine the total number of barrels of wine produced, we must first calculate the total tons of grapes produced and then multiply that by the number of barrels per ton.

Given that each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year and there are 10 acres, the total tons of grapes produced can be calculated as follows:

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we multiply the total tons by the number of barrels produced per ton, which is 2 barrels:

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, the farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we can break down his cheese consumption into three categories: lunch, breakfast, and macaroni and cheese.

Carl's lunch consumption can be calculated as 2 slices per sandwich, with 7 days in a week, resulting in a total of 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

For breakfast, Carl used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, which is 3 slices per omelet. With 3 days of omelet consumption, the total number of slices used is 3 * 3 = 9.

Lastly, Carl used 8 slices of cheese in his macaroni and cheese dish.

To find the total number of slices used, we add these amounts together: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To determine the total number of pens Janet has now, we can employ the principle of addition. We start by adding the initial quantities of each color of pens:

22 (green) + 10 (yellow) = 32

Next, we calculate the total number of pens in the bags of blue and red pens:

6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag: 6 × 9 = 54
2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag: 2 × 6 = 12

Now, we add the total number of pens in the bags to the initial quantities:

32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98

Therefore, Janet now has 98 pens."
"To calculate the required score for Brinley's sixth test, we must first determine the total score she needs to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score. 

Let's denote the sum of the scores of the first five tests as S. We know that S = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438. Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we assume the lowest score is 71. 

The total score for six tests should be 93 * 6 = 558. To find the required score for the sixth test, we subtract the sum of the first five tests from the desired total score: 558 - 438 = 120.

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 120 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

The final answer is 120."
"To calculate the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we can break down the problem into two distinct periods.

First, let's calculate the total kilometers for the initial period. Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks, covering a distance of 25 kilometers each time. We can express this as:

5 times/week * 4 weeks * 25 kilometers/time = 500 kilometers

Next, we'll calculate the total kilometers for the second period. Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks, covering a distance of 60 kilometers each time. We can express this as:

2 times/week * 3 weeks * 60 kilometers/time = 360 kilometers

Now, we can find the total kilometers by adding the kilometers from both periods:

500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers

The final answer is: $\boxed{860}$"
"To calculate the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we must first determine the weight of each type of candy and then sum them.

Given that each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars can be calculated as follows:

25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g. With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:

80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag:

1000g + 1600g = 2600g

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g."
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. This can be expressed as 3 × 4 = 12.

Next, we calculate the number of cakes she bought on Wednesday, which is five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. This can be expressed as 5 × 12 = 60.

Now, we add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76.

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables and setting up an equation. Let's denote the cost of one cup as 'c'. We know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is $6000. 

We can set up the equation as follows:

20 * 12 * c = 6000 - 1200

Simplifying the equation, we get:

240c = 4800

Now, we can solve for 'c' by dividing both sides by 240:

c = 4800 / 240

c = 20

Therefore, the cost of each cup is $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the number of lawn mowing sessions required for Sara to afford the jacket and shoes, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of lawn mowing sessions as 'x'. Since she earns $4 per session, her total earnings from lawn mowing will be $4x. We know she needs to earn a total of $60 to buy the jacket and shoes. Adding the initial $10 she already has, we can set up the equation:

$4x + $10 = $60

Subtracting $10 from both sides gives us:

$4x = $50

Dividing both sides by $4:

x = $50 / $4
x = 12.5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a lawn mowing session, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more accurate to consider that Sara would need to mow the lawn 13 times to earn at least $52, which exceeds the required amount of $50.

Final answer: 13"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is 42, and each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, while each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day. This can be represented by the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To calculate the time Gary spends walking around the edge of the local park, we must first determine the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(l + w), where l represents the length and w represents the width.

Given that the length of the park is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now, we can divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the edge of the local park.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic sequences. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as 'a', the number of customers on the second day as 'a + d', and the number of customers on the third day as 'a + 2d'. 

We are given that the number of customers on the first day is 100, so a = 100. We are also given that the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, so a + d = 150. 

Solving for 'd', we get d = 50. 

Now, we can find the number of customers on the third day by substituting 'a' and 'd' into the expression a + 2d: 
100 + 2(50) = 100 + 100 = 200.

Therefore, Sloane counted 200 customers on the third day.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Then, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in both pools has decreased by 4 gallons/minute for the past 4 minutes. So, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Then, the big pool has 4y gallons of water now.

We can set up the following equations:

x - 16 = y  ... (Equation 1)
2x - 16 = 4y  ... (Equation 2)

We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

Rearranging Equation 1, we get x = y + 16.

Substituting this expression for x into Equation 2, we get:

2(y + 16) - 16 = 4y
2y + 32 - 16 = 4y
2y + 16 = 4y
16 = 2y
y = 8

Now that we know y, we can find x by substituting y into Equation 1:

x - 16 = 8
x = 24

The small pool now has 8 gallons of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of hours Lori needs to work, we can use the following calculation:

Total cost of items = $320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00

Now, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To calculate Janeth's remaining balance, we need to determine the total amount she needs to pay and subtract it from the initial amount borrowed.

The total amount Janeth needs to pay is the initial amount borrowed plus 10% of the initial amount. 

Let's calculate 10% of the initial amount: 
10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

Now, we add the additional amount to the initial amount: 
$2000 + $200 = $2200

Since Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate the total amount she will pay: 
$165 * 12 = $1980

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount owed: 
$2200 - $1980 = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we can utilize the principle of addition. Given that there are 4 roses and 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
= 4 + 7
= 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
= 4 + 11
= 15

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To find the average age of the three individuals in three years, we can utilize the concept of linear equations and algebraic manipulation.

Let's denote Harriet's current age as H, Zack's current age as Z, and Adrian's current age as A. We are given that H = 21 and H = Z/2. Therefore, we can express Zack's age as Z = 2H = 2(21) = 42.

Since A = 3H, we can substitute the value of H to find Adrian's current age: A = 3(21) = 63.

In three years, their ages will be H + 3, Z + 3, and A + 3, respectively. We can express these ages as:

H + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24
Z + 3 = 42 + 3 = 45
A + 3 = 63 + 3 = 66

The average age of the three in three years can be calculated as (H + 3 + Z + 3 + A + 3) / 3. Substituting the values, we get:

(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To determine Jojo's score, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of points Jojo scored as 'j', Naomi's score as 'n', Yuri's score as 'y', and Brianna's score as 'b'. We are given the following information:

1. The total points scored by all four students is 251: n + y + b + j = 251
2. Naomi scored 68 points: n = 68
3. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points: y = (1/2)n + 10
4. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi: b = n + 17

We can substitute the values of n, y, and b into the first equation to solve for j:

68 + ((1/2)(68) + 10) + (68 + 17) + j = 251

Simplifying the equation:

68 + 34 + 10 + 85 + j = 251

Combine like terms:

197 + j = 251

Subtract 197 from both sides:

j = 54

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

The final answer is 54."
"To calculate the total time spent on crossword puzzles, we can multiply the number of puzzles by the time spent per puzzle: 3 crossword puzzles * 10 minutes/puzzle = 30 minutes.

Similarly, for sudoku puzzles, we multiply the number of puzzles by the time spent per puzzle: 8 sudoku puzzles * 5 minutes/puzzle = 40 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles to find the total time: 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the current amount of water in the tank, we must first calculate the remaining water after Celine used 90 liters from the initial 120 liters.

Remaining water = Initial water - Water used
Remaining water = 120 - 90
Remaining water = 30 liters

Next, we need to calculate the amount of rainwater collected, which is twice the remaining water.

Rainwater = 2 * Remaining water
Rainwater = 2 * 30
Rainwater = 60 liters

Now, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water to find the current amount of water in the tank.

Current water = Remaining water + Rainwater
Current water = 30 + 60
Current water = 90 liters

Therefore, the current amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

Final answer: 90"

"To determine the total number of days for the round trip, we must consider the time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and the time it takes to return from Rochester to New Jersey by car.

The bus trip from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days. Since the car trip from Rochester to New Jersey takes half as many days as the bus trip, we can calculate the car trip duration as 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The total number of days for the round trip is the sum of the bus trip and the car trip, which is 6 + 3 = 9 days.

Therefore, the total number of days for the round trip is 9 days."
"To calculate the probability of picking a water type card, we need to determine the total number of cards James has after the changes. 

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. He loses 8 water type cards, so he now has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. He buys 14 grass type cards, so he now has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire type) + 34 (grass type) + 32 (water type) = 96 cards.

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96. To express this as a percentage, we can divide 32 by 96 and multiply by 100: (32 ÷ 96) × 100 = 33.33%.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water type card is 33%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{33\%}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's meal, we can break down the costs as follows:

The base burrito costs $6.50. Adding the extra meat for $2.00, the total becomes $6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50. Then, adding the extra cheese for $1.00, the total is $8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50. Next, adding the avocado for $1.00, the total is $9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50. Finally, adding the 2 sauces for $0.50 each, the total is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00. 

The upgrade adds $3.00 to the total, making it $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00. However, Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."
"To determine the time it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of piece placement.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute, and her mom's rate is half of that, which is 2 pieces per minute. Their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates: 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the time required to complete the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

Time = Total Pieces / Combined Rate
Time = 360 / 6
Time = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours by dividing by 60:

Time (in hours) = 60 minutes / 60
Time (in hours) = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we must first calculate the initial number of watermelons ready for harvest. This can be found by multiplying the total number of watermelons by the percentage that were ready for harvest.

Let's calculate 30% of 120:

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

Now, we need to find the number of watermelons remaining after the initial harvest. We subtract the initial number of harvested watermelons from the total:

Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84

Next, we calculate 3/4 of the remaining watermelons to determine the number ready for harvest after two weeks:

3/4 of 84 = 63

Finally, we subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the remaining watermelons to find the number not ready for harvest:

Watermelons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To calculate the total cost, we can break down the expenses into three components: the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

First, let's calculate the cost of the cars: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000.

Next, we need to calculate the tax, which is 10% of the cost of the cars. To find 10% of $240,000, we multiply $240,000 by 0.10, which gives us $24,000.

Finally, we need to calculate the registration fees, which are $1,000 per car. With 12 cars, the total registration fees come out to be 12 * $1,000 = $12,000.

Now, we add up the costs: $240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To determine the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Given that Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert on Monday, and Robert collects 20 shells, we can express this as an equation:

Let's denote the number of shells Robert collects as R and the number of shells Kylie collects as K. We have:

R = 20
K = R + 5
K = 20 + 5
K = 25

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. This can be expressed as:

K_Tuesday = 2 * K
K_Tuesday = 2 * 25
K_Tuesday = 50

Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the total number of insects in the garden, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Given that the number of bugs is half the number of ants, we can express this relationship as a ratio.

Number of bugs = (1/2) * Number of ants
= (1/2) * 50
= 25

Now, we can add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects.

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
= 50 + 25
= 75

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To determine the number of penguins still sunbathing, we must first calculate the total number of penguins that left their sunbathing spot. One-third of the 36 penguins jumped into the ocean, which is equivalent to 36 / 3 = 12 penguins. Similarly, another one-third of the penguins went inside the cave to eat their dinner, also 12 penguins. 

The total number of penguins that left sunbathing is the sum of these two groups: 12 + 12 = 24 penguins.

To find the number of penguins still sunbathing, we subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12 penguins.

Therefore, the number of penguins still sunbathing is 12.

Final Answer: The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of vines required, we must first calculate the total weekly tomato consumption. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and he consumes 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend's daily consumption is 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes. Therefore, their combined daily consumption is 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes.

Multiplying this by 7 days yields a weekly consumption of 9 * 7 = 63 tomatoes.

Given that each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total weekly consumption by 3 to determine the number of vines needed: 63 / 3 = 21.

Therefore, Steve requires 21 vines to meet his and his girlfriend's weekly tomato needs.

Final answer: 21"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we can use the division operation. 

Let's denote the total number of slices needed as 'T' and the number of slices per pizza as 's'. We know that T = 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices. We also know that pizzas are sold in 8 slices, so we can set up the equation: 

T = 8 * p, where 'p' is the number of pizzas.

Substituting T = 80, we get:

80 = 8 * p

To solve for 'p', we can divide both sides by 8:

p = 80 / 8

p = 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we need to consider the process of mixing ink from empty pens to create new full pens. Since Ram can create one full pen from 5 empty pens, we can calculate the total number of full pens he can make from 25 pens.

Let's use the division operation to find the number of full pens: 25 ÷ 5 = 5.

This calculation indicates that Ram can create 5 full pens from the 25 pens. Since the question asks for the total number of pens Ram can have, we can conclude that he will have 5 full pens.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the final amount of money Johnny had after a year, we can follow a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to determine the initial amount of money Johnny had. He started with $20 and added an extra $10 to it, resulting in a total of $30.

Next, we know that the money tripled in value over the course of the year. To find the final amount, we can multiply the initial total by 3.

The calculation is as follows: $30 * 3 = $90.

Therefore, Johnny had $90 after a year."
"To solve this problem, we can represent the ages of the girls using variables. Let's denote Jessa's age as J, Joan's age as J + 5, and Mary's age as J + 5 + 2, since Mary is two years younger than Joan.

We are given that Jessa is 20 years old, so J = 20. Substituting this value into the expressions for Joan's and Mary's ages, we get:

Joan's age: J + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
Mary's age: J + 5 + 2 = 20 + 5 + 2 = 27

Now, we can find the sum of their ages:
J + (J + 5) + (J + 5 + 2) = 20 + 25 + 27 = 72

Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 72.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as:

Number of students through exit A = 30% of 1000
= (30/100) * 1000
= 0.3 * 1000
= 300 students

Next, we need to find the number of students remaining after 300 students went out through exit A. This can be calculated as:

Number of students remaining = Total number of students - Number of students through exit A
= 1000 - 300
= 700 students

Now, we need to find the number of students who went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, we can calculate this as:

Number of students through exit B = (3/5) * 700
= (3/5) * (700/1)
= (3 * 700) / 5
= 2100 / 5
= 420 students

Finally, we can find the number of students who went out through exit C by subtracting the number of students through exit B from the number of students remaining:

Number of students through exit C = Number of students remaining - Number of students through exit B
= 700 - 420
= 280 students

The number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we can represent the number of candies each person has with variables. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as 'r', James has as 'j', and John has as 'o'. We are given that John has twice as many candies as Robert, so we can express this as an equation:

o = 2r

We are also given that John has 54 candies, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

54 = 2r

To solve for 'r', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

r = 54 / 2
r = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find James' candies by adding 6 to Robert's amount:

j = r + 6
j = 27 + 6
j = 33

Finally, to find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' candies from John's candies:

o - j = 54 - 33
o - j = 21

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the total number of books Dolly and Pandora will collectively read, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of books each person has and the number of books they will read from the other person.

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book, so she will read a total of 2 + 2 = 4 books.

Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book, so she will read a total of 1 + 1 = 2 books.

The total number of books they will collectively read is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

Therefore, the total number of books Dolly and Pandora will collectively read is 6."
"To determine the total time spent writing per week, we can break down the problem into manageable components.

First, we need to calculate the total number of letters written and received per week. Since Mike has 3 remaining penpals, and they each send 2 letters a week, the total number of letters received is 3 * 2 = 6. As Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week. Therefore, the total number of letters written and received per week is 6 (sent) + 6 (received) = 12.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages written per week is 12 * 5 = 60.

Given that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, we can calculate the total time spent writing per week by multiplying the total number of pages by the time it takes to write one page: 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 minutes / 60 = 6 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 6 hours per week writing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan, we must first calculate the total minutes used for his daily call with his boss. Since he has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for this call can be calculated as follows:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. Therefore, the total minutes used is the sum of these two:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan:

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach to isolate the variable representing the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as x.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy then took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

Final answer: $\boxed{14}$"
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we can break down the problem into manageable components. 

First, we need to find the total hours worked. Since she works 6 hours a day for 4 days a week, the total hours worked per week is 6 * 4 = 24 hours. For a 5-week period, the total hours worked would be 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount. The hourly rate is $250, so the total cost is 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

To apply the 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $30,000. This can be calculated as 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the amount Jean paid: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To determine the cost per person, we must first calculate the total cost of all the party supplies. This can be achieved by summing the individual costs of the items purchased.

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. To find the cost per person, we divide the total cost by the number of people.

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

Therefore, each person paid $32."
"To calculate the total cost, we can utilize the formula for calculating the total cost of goods, which is the product of the number of units, the weight per unit, and the cost per unit.

Let's break it down:

Number of bags: 4
Weight per bag: 50 pounds
Cost per pound: $1.50

Total weight: 4 * 50 = 200 pounds
Total cost: 200 * $1.50 = $300

Therefore, the total cost is $300."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. 

First, we need to find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday. Since she ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, and her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, we can calculate Sue's cookies on Monday as follows:

Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies

Next, we need to find out how many cookies Sue ate on Tuesday. Since she ate twice as many cookies as her sister, and her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, we can calculate Sue's cookies on Tuesday as follows:

Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies

Now, we can find the total number of cookies eaten by Sue by adding the cookies she ate on Monday and Tuesday:

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

We also need to find the total number of cookies eaten by her sister:

Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

To find the difference in calories consumed, we multiply the total number of cookies eaten by each person by 200 (since 1 cookie has 200 calories):

Calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

Now, we can find the difference in calories consumed by subtracting the calories consumed by her sister from the calories consumed by Sue:

Calories consumed by Sue more than her sister = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

The final answer is: $\boxed{5600}$"
"To determine the number of boys in the third class, we can start by finding the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, we can calculate the total number of girls as 50% of the total number of students. 

Let's denote the total number of students as 'T'. Since there are 3 classes, the total number of students is 3T. 

The total number of girls is 50% of 3T, which is 0.5 * 3T = 1.5T. 

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is 1.5T - 15 - 12. 

Since the total number of students is 3T, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of girls: 1.5T = 30 (since 50% of the students are girls). 

Solving for T, we get T = 30 / 1.5 = 20. 

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of boys in the third class. The total number of boys is 3T - 30 (since 50% of the students are boys). 

Substituting T = 20, we get 3(20) - 30 = 60 - 30 = 30 boys. 

However, we need to find the number of boys in the third class. We know that the first and second classes have 15 + 12 = 27 boys. 

So, the number of boys in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3 boys.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the current number of apps on Travis' tablet, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. 

We start with the initial number of apps, which is 61. Then, we subtract the number of apps deleted, which is 9, and finally, we add the number of apps downloaded, which is 18.

Using the order of operations, we first perform the subtraction: 61 - 9 = 52. Then, we add 18 to the result: 52 + 18 = 70.

Therefore, the current number of apps on Travis' tablet is 70."
"To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we can break down the information into two parts: wolves and cougars.

First, let's analyze the information given:

- Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night.
- Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves.
- Today, he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals Rick killed:

Total wolves = 10 (last night) + 45 (today) = 55 wolves
Total cougars = 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27 cougars

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of wolves and cougars: 55 + 27 = 82.

The final answer is: $\boxed{82}$"
"To determine the floor Bill is on now, we can apply a straightforward arithmetic operation. 

We are given that Bill starts on the 3rd floor and rides the elevator to the floor that's equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6. This can be expressed as:

Floor = 4 × Starting Floor + 6

Substituting the given starting floor (3) into the equation:

Floor = 4 × 3 + 6
Floor = 12 + 6
Floor = 18

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To determine the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we can use the concept of percentages and proportions. 

First, we need to calculate 30% of 30, which represents the reduction in the number of times Anne went down the slide compared to Mitchel. This can be calculated as 0.3 * 30 = 9.

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we subtract 9 from 30 to find the number of times Anne went down the slide: 30 - 9 = 21.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. To find the number of times Robert went down the slide, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4: 4 * 21 = 84.

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we must first calculate the total number of cows in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls.

The initial number of cows in each stall is 20. When 40 new cows are added and divided among the 20 stalls, the number of cows in each stall becomes:
20 + 40/20 = 20 + 2 = 22 cows per stall.

Now, we can calculate the number of cows in 8 of the stalls:
Number of cows in 8 stalls = 22 cows per stall * 8 stalls = 176 cows.

The final answer is: $\boxed{176}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we can utilize the concept of place value and the respective values of each coin.

First, let's calculate the value of each type of coin:

- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2
- 40 dollar bills = 40 x $1 = $40

Now, let's add the values together: $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45

Therefore, Brady has a total of $45 in his piggy bank."
"To calculate the total weight of the redwood, we can use the formula:

Total Weight = (Total Height / Height per Section) * Weight per Section

Given:
Total Height = 200 feet
Height per Section = 10 feet
Weight per Section = 400 pounds

Total Weight = (200 / 10) * 400
Total Weight = 20 * 400
Total Weight = 8000 pounds

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can calculate the weight of the eaten wood as follows:

Weight of Eaten Wood = Total Weight * 0.3
Weight of Eaten Wood = 8000 * 0.3
Weight of Eaten Wood = 2400 pounds

Now, we can find the weight of the remaining wood by subtracting the weight of the eaten wood from the total weight:

Weight of Remaining Wood = Total Weight - Weight of Eaten Wood
Weight of Remaining Wood = 8000 - 2400
Weight of Remaining Wood = 5600 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds.

Final answer: 5600"
"To calculate the total amount Nancy owes, we can break down the problem into two components: the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue.

The cost of the overdue books can be calculated using the formula: Total Cost = Number of Books * Cost per Book
Total Cost = 8 * $0.50
Total Cost = $4.00

The flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue is a fixed amount of $2.00.

To find the total amount Nancy owes, we add the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee: Total Amount = Total Cost + Flat Fee
Total Amount = $4.00 + $2.00
Total Amount = $6.00

Therefore, Nancy owes a total of $6.00."
"To solve this problem, we can represent the number of apples and bananas for Andrea and Jamal using variables. Let's denote the number of apples as A and the number of bananas as B.

We are given that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so we can write an equation:
A = B + 8

We are also given that Andrea has 52 apples, so we can substitute 52 for A:
52 = B + 8

Now, we can solve for B by subtracting 8 from both sides:
B = 52 - 8
B = 44

Next, we are given that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so we can write another equation:
B = A + 4

Substituting B = 44 and A = 52 into this equation, we get:
44 = 52 + 4

However, this equation is not true, which means our initial assumption that B = 44 is incorrect. Let's re-examine the problem.

We can rewrite the equation B = A + 4 as A = B - 4 and substitute A = 52:
52 = B - 4

Now, we can solve for B by adding 4 to both sides:
B = 52 + 4
B = 56

Now that we have the correct value for B, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:
Andrea's bananas = B/2
Andrea's bananas = 56/2
Andrea's bananas = 28

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have:
Total fruits = (A + B) + (A + B)
Total fruits = (52 + 56) + (52 + 56)
Total fruits = 108 + 108
Total fruits = 216

The final answer is: $\boxed{216}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she is making. This can be done by adding the number of cookies she plans to make today to the number of cookies she plans to make tomorrow.

Total number of cookies = 36 (today) + 30 (tomorrow) = 66 cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are required to make a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the total amount of flour needed by dividing the total number of cookies by 12 and then multiplying by 2.

Total flour needed = (66 cookies / 12) * 2 cups
= 5.5 * 2 cups
= 11 cups

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can use the following calculation:

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. Let's denote the number of trees in Chris's yard as C, the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard as F, and the number of trees in Harry's yard as H.

We are given that C = 6. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, we can express this as F = C / 2. Substituting the value of C, we get F = 6 / 2 = 3.

Now, we are told that Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. This can be expressed as H = 2F + 5. Substituting the value of F, we get H = 2(3) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: H - F = 11 - 3 = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard."
"To determine the total amount of money the girls have, we can apply basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote Carmen's amount as C, Samantha's amount as S, and Daisy's amount as D. We are given the following information:

C = $100
S = C + $25
D = S + $50

We can substitute the expression for S into the equation for D:
D = (C + $25) + $50
D = C + $75

Now, we can add up the amounts:
Total = C + S + D
Total = C + (C + $25) + (C + $75)
Total = 3C + $100

Substituting the value of C:
Total = 3($100) + $100
Total = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To calculate the total price of the house, we need to consider the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which can be calculated as 0.05 × $350,000 = $17,500. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which can be calculated as 0.12 × $350,000 = $42,000.

The total additional fees are the sum of the brokerage fee and the transfer fee: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500.

To find the total price of the house, we add the selling price and the total additional fees: $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500.

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To calculate Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to consider the total amount paid in transfer fees and brokerage fees, as well as the remaining loan amount.

Transfer fees: 3% of the selling price = 0.03 × $400,000 = $12,000
Brokerage fee: 5% of the selling price = 0.05 × $400,000 = $20,000
Total amount paid: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000
Remaining loan amount: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000

The net proceeds from selling the house can be calculated by subtracting the total amount paid from the selling price:

Net proceeds = Selling price - Total amount paid
= $400,000 - $32,000
= $368,000

The final answer is: $368,000"
"To determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we must consider the time it takes to heat up the oil and the time it takes to cook the chicken.

First, we calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. The initial heating time is 20 minutes, and then it takes 40% longer to reach the desired temperature. To find 40% of 20 minutes, we multiply 20 by 0.4, which equals 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat up the oil to 400 degrees is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to warm up the oil. Since it took 28 minutes to heat up the oil, the cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

Now, we add the time it took to heat up the oil and the time it took to cook the chicken to find the total time. The total time is 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{51}$"
"To calculate the total amount spent on all ads, we can utilize the principle of arithmetic addition.

"To determine the total number of M&Ms Mary received, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag:
- The first bag contains 300 M&Ms.
- The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it contains 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
- The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it contains 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, we add the number of M&Ms in each bag to find the total:
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

Therefore, Mary received a total of 762 M&Ms."
"To determine the total number of windows, we must consider the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows not connected to bedrooms. 

First, we calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms: 
2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows

Next, we calculate the total number of additional windows not connected to bedrooms: 
2 houses * 4 additional windows per house = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows: 
12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99 + $1.00 (rounded to the nearest cent) = $15.99

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid: 
$20 - $15.99 = $4.01

Therefore, the change given to the mother is $4.01."
"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of stitches for each sleeve as 'x'. The total number of stitches for the sweater is the sum of the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette, which is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170. Since the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630.

We can express this as an equation: 2x = 630, where 'x' represents the number of stitches for each sleeve.

Solving for 'x', we get x = 630 / 2 = 315.

Therefore, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

The final answer is 315."
"To calculate the total cost of the seeds, we can apply the principle of multiplication to find the cost of each type of seed and then add the results.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet, which can be expressed as 20 × $40. This calculation yields a total of $800.

Similarly, the cost of the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30 per packet, which can be expressed as 80 × $30. This calculation yields a total of $2400.

To find the overall cost, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds: $800 + $2400 = $3200.

Therefore, the total cost of the seeds is $3200."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we can break down the problem into three components: the song, the first scene, and the second scene.

Let's denote the number of lines in the song as S, the number of lines in the first scene as F, and the number of lines in the second scene as L. We are given the following information:

1. The song has 54 lines, so S = 54.
2. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so F = 2S = 2(54) = 108.
3. Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's, so the number of lines Sean has from the first scene is F/3 = 108/3 = 36.
4. The second scene has six more lines than the song, so L = S + 6 = 54 + 6 = 60.
5. Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's, so the number of lines Sean has from the second scene is (4/5)L = (4/5)(60) = 48.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: S + F/3 + (4/5)L = 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

Therefore, Sean has a total of 138 lines to memorize.

The final answer is: $\boxed{138}$"
"To determine the number of cards with the letter D, we can break down the problem into steps:

First, we need to find the number of cards with the letter A. Since 2/5 of the cards have the letter A, we can calculate this as:

(2/5) × 80 = 32

Next, we subtract the number of cards with the letter A from the total number of cards to find the remaining cards:

80 - 32 = 48

Now, we need to find the number of cards with the letter B. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards have the letter B, we can calculate this as:

(1/2) × 48 = 24

Subtracting the number of cards with the letter B from the remaining cards gives us:

48 - 24 = 24

Finally, we need to find the number of cards with the letter C. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards have the letter C, we can calculate this as:

(5/8) × 24 = 15

To find the number of cards with the letter D, we subtract the number of cards with the letter C from the remaining cards:

24 - 15 = 9

Therefore, the number of cards with the letter D is 9."
"To determine the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we can calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

The time for small holes is 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours.

The time for large holes is 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 150 minutes / 60 = 2.5 hours.

The total time is the sum of the time for small holes and large holes: 1.5 hours + 2.5 hours = 4 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. Given that their current ages sum to 20, we can express this as an equation: M + C = 20.

When both individuals age by 10 years, their ages will increase by 10 each. Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years can be calculated by adding 10 to each of their current ages and then summing the results.

Mathematically, this can be represented as: (M + 10) + (C + 10) = M + C + 20.

Since M + C = 20, we can simplify the equation to: 20 + 20 = 40.

Thus, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 40."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can rewrite the second equation as:
R + 9 = 3S + 27

Substituting R = 6S into the rewritten equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Now, let's isolate S by subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

Therefore, Sam's current age is 6 years.

Next, we multiply the number of ice cream bars by their unit price: 4 * $0.50 = $2.

Finally, we add the costs of the popsicles and ice cream bars to find the total: $5 + $2 = $7.

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. First, we need to find the total number of spots on the cobras and mambas separately. 

We know that a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots. Therefore, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, we can calculate the total number of spots on the cobras and mambas:
40 cobras * 70 spots = 2800
60 mambas * 35 spots = 2100
Total spots = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

To find half the total number of spots, we can divide the total by 2:
4900 / 2 = 2450

Therefore, half the number of spots they all have combined is 2450.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To calculate the total cost of pizzas, we must first determine the total number of individuals attending the event. This can be achieved by adding the number of team members, coaches, and their guests.

Number of team members: 12
Number of coaches: 3
Number of guests: 12 * 2 = 24

Total number of individuals: 12 + 3 + 24 = 39

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we can calculate the number of pizzas required by dividing the total number of individuals by 3:
39 ÷ 3 = 13

To find the total cost, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza:
13 * $15 = $195

The final answer is: $195"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of topaz gemstones as 'n' and the length of each gemstone as 'g'. We are given that n = 8 and g = 1 inch. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and we want to find the number of sterling silver beads, denoted as 'b', which are used to fill the space between the gemstones.

The length of the space between the gemstones can be represented as (n - 1)g, since there are (n - 1) spaces between 'n' gemstones. We can set up the equation:

(n - 1)g + ng = 25

Substituting the given values, we get:

(8 - 1)(1) + 8(1) = 25
7 + 8 = 25

Now, we need to find the number of sterling silver beads used, which is the total length of the necklace minus the length of the gemstones. The length of the gemstones is ng = 8(1) = 8 inches. Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads is:

b = 25 - 8
b = 17

So, Katerina uses 17 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To calculate the total number of stories written, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic sequences. Each child doubled their initial number of stories in the second week. 

Let's denote the initial number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot as A, B, and M, respectively. We are given that A = 20, B = 40, and M = 60.

In the second week, each child doubles their initial number of stories. Therefore, the number of stories written by each child in the second week is 2A, 2B, and 2M, respectively.

The total number of stories written in the second week is the sum of the stories written by each child: 2A + 2B + 2M.

Substituting the given values, we get: 2(20) + 2(40) + 2(60) = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240.

To find the total number of stories written in both weeks, we add the number of stories written in the first week (A + B + M) to the number of stories written in the second week (2A + 2B + 2M).

The total number of stories written is A + B + M + 2A + 2B + 2M = (A + B + M) + (2A + 2B + 2M) = (A + B + M) + 2(A + B + M) = 3(A + B + M).

Substituting the given values, we get: 3(20 + 40 + 60) = 3(120) = 360.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the brother's age in 3 years, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. Given that the brother's current age is twice Ann's age, we can express this relationship as:

Brother's current age = 2 * Ann's current age
Brother's current age = 2 * 9
Brother's current age = 18

To find the brother's age in 3 years, we can add 3 to his current age:

Brother's age in 3 years = Brother's current age + 3
Brother's age in 3 years = 18 + 3
Brother's age in 3 years = 21

Therefore, the brother's age in 3 years will be 21."
"To determine the amount of money Kelly will have left after purchasing the can of pop, we must first calculate the total amount of money she possesses. This can be achieved by adding the value of the quarters and dimes.

The value of the quarters is 5 x 25 cents = 125 cents.
The value of the dimes is 2 x 10 cents = 20 cents.

The total amount of money Kelly has is 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

Next, we subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from the total amount of money Kelly has.

145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we can start by finding the total number of stars on the flag. 

Let's denote the number of 5-star rows as 'x'. Since there are 3 rows of 8 stars and 2 rows of 6 stars, the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 + 2 * 6 = 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

We know that the total number of stars on the flag is 76. Therefore, the number of 5-star rows can be found by subtracting the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars: 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

Since each row of 5 stars contributes 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows can be found by dividing the total number of 5-star rows by 5: x = 40 / 5 = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we must first calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, we can calculate the total weight as follows:

Total weight = Number of flagstones * Weight of each flagstone
Total weight = 80 * 75
Total weight = 6000 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trucks needed. Since the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, we can calculate the number of trucks as follows:

Number of trucks = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

Therefore, the customer will need 3 trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

Final answer: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we can utilize the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Given that the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, we can express the speed of the car in the slow lane as 60/2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can calculate the time taken by the car in the slow lane as follows:

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables:

Let A = number of medals Ali has
Let I = number of medals Izzy has
Let T = total number of medals given out

We are given that A = 22 and I = A - 5. We can substitute the value of I in terms of A into the equation:

I = 22 - 5
I = 17

We are also given that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. We can write this as:

T = 10(A + I)
T = 10(22 + 17)
T = 10(39)
T = 390

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

The final answer is: $\boxed{390}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars each child will receive, we must first calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. With 8 packets containing 5 chocolate bars each, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Next, we need to subtract the number of chocolate bars allocated to the adults. Since each adult receives 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16. To find out how many chocolate bars each child will receive, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children, which is 8. 

16 ÷ 8 = 2

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars."
"To calculate Susan's earnings, we must first determine the total minutes she works. Since she works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes
Subtracting the 30-minute pause, we get:
480 minutes - 30 minutes = 450 minutes

Given that Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can calculate her total earnings as follows:

450 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 45 intervals
45 intervals * $5/interval = $225

Therefore, Susan earns $225 for the online task.

The final answer is: $225"
"To determine the total points of the three players after the fourth round, we can analyze the given information.

Initially, we have:
- Mike's points: 21
- Jim's points: 21 - 3 = 18
- Tony's points: 21 * 2 = 42

Since all players have more than 20 points, they will receive an extra point each in the fourth round. We can express this as:

- Mike's points: 21 + 1 = 22
- Jim's points: 18 + 1 = 19
- Tony's points: 42 + 1 = 43

Now, let's add up the points of all three players:
22 + 19 + 43 = 84

"To determine the number of unwashed oranges, we must first calculate the total number of oranges washed by the sons. The oldest son, being 8 years old, washed 8 oranges, and the youngest son, being half as old as the oldest, washed 4 oranges.

Using the principle of arithmetic, we can calculate the total number of oranges washed by adding the oranges washed by both sons: 8 (oldest son) + 4 (youngest son) = 12 oranges.

Now, we subtract the total number of oranges washed from the initial number of oranges purchased by Will: 15 (initial oranges) - 12 (oranges washed) = 3 oranges.

Therefore, the number of unwashed oranges is 3."
"To calculate the total count of activities Darren has done in the two days, we can break it down as follows:

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the total count of each activity for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities is the sum of the individual totals: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370.

The final answer is: $\boxed{370}$"
"To determine the number of weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we must first calculate the total daily consumption of rice in the household. Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day, the total daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

With 5 members in the household, the total daily consumption is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg. To find the weekly consumption, we multiply this by 7, resulting in 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg per week.

Now, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to determine the number of weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of crates Sam was short of his target, we must first calculate the total number of crates sold. We can do this by adding the crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and then adding the crates sold over the weekend.

Let's denote the number of crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday as T, W, and Th, respectively. We are given the following information:

T = 15
W = 12
Th = 18
Weekend sales = 20

The total number of crates sold can be calculated as:

Total = T + W + Th + Weekend sales
Total = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20
Total = 65

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we can find the difference by subtracting the total number of crates sold from the target:

Difference = Target - Total
Difference = 120 - 65
Difference = 55

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To determine the total cost of the desk, we can analyze the sequence of bids. The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time, and there were 3 other people who bid once. 

The sequence of bids is: $200, $250, $300, and $350. Since Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, her bids are $200, $250, and $300. 

The final bid was $350. To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the desk to the last bid. 

$350 (final bid) + $300 (Carmen's last bid) = $650

We also need to consider the bids made by the other 3 people. The total of these bids is $150. 

$650 + $150 = $800

Therefore, the total cost of the desk is $800."
"To calculate the total cost of driving per year, we need to consider both the mileage-based cost and the monthly bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per year. John's daily commute is 30 miles round trip, so the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles. Since he works 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles. With 50 weeks in a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles.

The cost of driving per year is the total miles driven multiplied by the cost per mile, which is 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000.

Additionally, John receives a $150 monthly bonus. To find the total bonus paid per year, we multiply the monthly bonus by 12: $150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total cost per year is the sum of the driving cost and the bonus: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To determine the time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we must first calculate the combined time he exercised on Monday and Sunday.

Let's denote the time Peter exercised on Monday as M and the time he exercised on Sunday as S. We are given that M = 16 minutes and S = 23 minutes. The combined time is M + S = 16 + 23 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we can express this as 2(M + S). 

2(M + S) = 2(16 + 23) 
= 2(39) 
= 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we can analyze the problem from a geometric perspective. When a tabloid is folded in half, it creates two symmetrical halves. Each half consists of 16 pages, with 8 pages on the front and 8 pages on the back.

Since we have two halves, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:

2 × (8 + 8) = 2 × 16 = 32

However, this calculation assumes that each page is a separate entity. In reality, the pages are connected and form a single sheet of paper. Therefore, we need to consider the number of sheets required to produce 32 pages.

Since each sheet can produce 2 pages (one on the front and one on the back), we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to get the number of sheets:

32 ÷ 2 = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine the amount of money Annika has left, we can apply the principle of subtraction. Given that she initially had $50 and spent $25 on food and snacks, and an additional $10 on rides, we can calculate the remaining amount as follows:

Initial amount = $50
Amount spent on food and snacks = $25
Amount spent on rides = $10
Total amount spent = $25 + $10 = $35

To find the remaining amount, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

Remaining amount = Initial amount - Total amount spent
= $50 - $35
= $15

Therefore, Annika has $15 left.

Final answer: $15"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of books sold in the first year as x and the number of books sold in the second year as y.

We know that the total number of books sold in the first two years is 200, so we can write the equation: x + y = 200.

We also know that Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the second year, so we can write another equation: x = 2y.

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get: 2y + y = 200, which simplifies to 3y = 200.

Solving for y, we get: y = 200 / 3 = 66.67.

Since we can't sell a fraction of a book, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, but in this case, we can use the exact value to calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year.

The total amount of money earned in the second year is 20 * 66.67 = 1333.33.

However, since the question does not specify whether to round or not, we can also express the answer as a fraction: 20 * (200 / 3) = 400/3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{400}{3}}$"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for the month, we can break down the problem into two components: his regular hourly earnings and the bonus.

First, let's calculate his regular earnings. Since Watson works 10 hours a day and 5 days a week, his weekly earnings are 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week. With a daily wage of $10, his weekly earnings are 50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week.

Since there are 4 weeks in April, his total earnings from regular hours are $500/week * 4 weeks = $2000.

Next, we add the $300 bonus he receives for the month, resulting in a total of $2000 + $300 = $2300.

Therefore, Watson's total earnings for the month of April are $2300.

The final answer is: $2300"
"To determine the number of people John lost to, we can calculate the percentage of people he lost as a decimal and then multiply it by the total number of people he wrestled.

The percentage of people John lost to is 20% (1 - 80% = 20%). As a decimal, this is 0.2.

Now, we multiply the total number of people he wrestled (20) by the decimal equivalent of the percentage he lost to (0.2):

20 * 0.2 = 4

Therefore, John lost to 4 people."
"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we must first calculate the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales. Since two-thirds of the 60 loaves are sold in the morning, we can express this as a fraction: (2/3) * 60. To simplify, we multiply the numerator (2) by 60 and divide by the denominator (3), resulting in 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we subtract the morning sales from the total to find the remaining loaves: 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, we can express this as (1/2) * 20. To simplify, we multiply the numerator (1) by 20 and divide by the denominator (2), resulting in 10 loaves sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we can use the concept of proportional reasoning. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can set up a proportion to find the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Let x be the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. We can set up the proportion as follows:

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 8 pounds / x weeks

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

8x = 8 * 4
8x = 32

Now, we can divide both sides by 8:

x = 32 / 8
x = 4

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

The final answer is: 4"

"To determine the total number of new limbs, we can analyze the growth pattern of the extra arms and legs.

The person grows an extra arm every 3 days, which is a periodic event with a period of 3. In 15 days, there will be 15 / 3 = 5 complete periods, resulting in 5 extra arms.

Similarly, the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, which is a periodic event with a period of 5. In 15 days, there will be 15 / 5 = 3 complete periods, resulting in 3 extra legs.

The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and legs, which is 5 + 3 = 8.

Therefore, the person will grow a total of 8 new limbs after 15 days.

Final answer: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the amount Theo needs to spend on gifts for his business partners, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased.

The cost of 6 business suits is 6 * $100 = $600. The cost of 3 suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, which is 5 * $100 = $500, making the flight ticket $500 + $700 = $1200.

The total cost of items purchased is $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Now, we subtract the total cost of items purchased from Theo's total budget of $6000 to find the remaining amount he has for gifts: $6000 - $1950 = $4050.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract that from the remaining amount: $4050 - $2000 = $2050.

Therefore, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of eggs consumed by the three individuals who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two individuals who eat two eggs each day.

Let's calculate the total eggs consumed per day by the three individuals who eat three eggs each day. This can be represented as 3 × 3 = 9 eggs per day.

Next, we'll calculate the total eggs consumed per day by the two individuals who eat two eggs each day. This can be represented as 2 × 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Now, we'll add the total eggs consumed per day by both groups to find the overall daily egg consumption. This can be represented as 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we'll multiply the daily egg consumption by 7, since there are 7 days in a week. This can be represented as 13 × 7 = 91 eggs per week.

Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, we can represent the ages of Trent, Jane, and Quinn using variables. Let's denote Quinn's age as Q, Jane's age as J, and Trent's age as T.

Given that Quinn is 30 years old, we can write an equation:

Q = 30

We are also given that Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so we can express Jane's age in terms of Quinn's age:

J = Q - 3

Substituting Q = 30 into the equation, we get:

J = 30 - 3
J = 27

Now, we are told that Trent is 5 years older than Jane. We can express Trent's age in terms of Jane's age:

T = J + 5

Substituting J = 27 into the equation, we get:

T = 27 + 5
T = 32

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote Noah's current age as N and the current population of Chile as P.

We are given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, and Cera is currently 46 years old. Therefore, six years ago, Cera was 40 years old. This gives us the equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(40)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

N - 6 = 20

Adding 6 to both sides, we find:

N = 26

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Let's denote the population six years ago as P6. We can express this as:

P6 = 3000N

Substituting N = 26, we get:

P6 = 3000(26)
P6 = 78000

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can set up the equation:

P6 = (1/2)P

Substituting P6 = 78000, we get:

78000 = (1/2)P

Multiplying both sides by 2, we find:

P = 156000

Therefore, the current population of Chile is 156000.

The final answer is: $oxed{156000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a systematic approach to isolate the variable 'x', which represents the number of players on the defense.

Let's begin by setting up the equation based on the given information:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, which is the least common multiple of the denominators:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combining like terms, we get:

7x = 210

Now, we can solve for 'x' by dividing both sides of the equation by 7:

x = 210/7

x = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the number of people who show up for Martha's party, we must consider the total number of people invited and the number of people who are unable to attend.

First, we calculate the total number of people invited. There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people. Additionally, there are 3 families with 4 people each, resulting in 3 x 4 = 12 people. The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Next, we subtract the 8 people who are unable to attend due to illness. This leaves us with 24 - 8 = 16 people.

Furthermore, 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come had previous commitments. To find this number, we calculate 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Finally, we subtract the 2 people with previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To calculate the total weight of marbles, we need to determine the total number of marbles first. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

We can express this as an equation: 
Let x be the number of marbles Solomon bought from Johanna. 
Then, his father gave him 2/5 * x marbles. 
The total number of marbles is x + 2/5 * x. 
Since we know that x + 2/5 * x = 20 + 8, we can solve for x: 
x + 2/5 * x = 28 
(7/5) * x = 28 
x = 28 * (5/7) 
x = 20 

Now that we know x, we can find the total number of marbles: 
Total marbles = x + 2/5 * x 
= 20 + 8 
= 28 

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles is 28 * 2 = 56 kgs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we must first determine the volume of the rectangular prism. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is V = L * W * H, where L is the length, W is the width, and H is the height.

Given the dimensions of the pool, we can plug in the values as follows:

V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Since the cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

Cost = V * $0.1
Cost = 120 * $0.1
Cost = $12

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of boys as B, the number of girls as G, and the number of nongendered children as N.

We are given that the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, so we can write the equation:

G = 3B

We are also given that the classroom has 30 boys, so B = 30.

Substituting B = 30 into the first equation, we get:

G = 3(30)
G = 90

Additionally, we are given that the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so we can write the equation:

N = (1/10)B
N = (1/10)(30)
N = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:

Total = B + G + N
Total = 30 + 90 + 3
Total = 123

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To determine the number of electric poles required, we can utilize the concept of equivalent ratios. Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to solve for the number of poles.

Let's denote the number of poles as x. The ratio of poles to wires is 1:3, so we can write the proportion as:

1/3 = x/45

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 × 45 = 3x
45 = 3x

Next, we divide both sides by 3 to isolate x:

x = 45 ÷ 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of women left at the party, we must first calculate the total number of people who left. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can express this as a fraction:

1/4 * Total number of people = Number of people who left

We know that 22 men stayed at the party, so the number of men who left is:
25 - 22 = 3 men

Since 3 men left, and 10 people in total left, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

1/4 * Total number of people = 3 (men who left)

To solve for the total number of people, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

Total number of people = 3 * 4
Total number of people = 12

Now that we know the total number of people, we can calculate the number of women left:
Number of women left = Total number of people - Number of men left
= 12 - 3
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the cost of the pen, we can analyze the given information using basic arithmetic principles.

Let's denote the cost of the magazine as M and the cost of the pen as P. We are given the following information:

1. The magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4. Therefore, we can express this as an equation: M = 0.5 * 4.
2. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, which can be expressed as: P = M - 1.

First, we calculate the cost of the magazine: M = 0.5 * 4 = 2.

Next, we substitute the value of M into the equation for the pen: P = 2 - 1 = 1.

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the total number of pencils, we can start by adding the number of pencils Jam has to the number of pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 3 * 24 (assuming each box has 24 pencils) + 2 = 74.

Adding Meg's pencils, the total number of pencils is 74 + 46 = 120.

Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 24 to find the number of boxes needed.

120 / 24 = 5

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.

Final answer: 5"
"To determine the total weakening of Shannon's iced coffee, we must consider the combined effects of cooling and added liquid.

The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, it means 5 ice cubes were used (65 / 13 = 5). 

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of old records brought in by the 5 people as x.

Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is 2x. Since 5 people traded their records, the total number of old records traded is 2x.

We are also given that the 5 people left with 7 new records. Since each person got 1 new record, the total number of new records is 5. We can set up the equation:

2x = 5

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 5/2

x = 2.5

However, since we can't trade a fraction of a record, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can express the answer as a fraction to maintain precision.

x = 5/2

x = 2.5

Since we can't trade a fraction of a record, we can express the answer as a whole number by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 2.

x = 5/2 * 2/2

x = 5

x = 5"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.

Let's denote the number of junior programmers as J and the number of senior programmers as S. We are given that J = (2/5) * 100 = 40 and S = 100 - J = 60.

The salary of junior programmers is $2000 per month, and senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their salary is $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month can be represented as:

Total Salary = (J * $2000) + (S * $2400)

Substituting the values of J and S, we get:

Total Salary = (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)
Total Salary = $80,000 + $144,000
Total Salary = $224,000

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224,000."
"To determine the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as x.

We know that 5 people got on at the first stop, and 8 more got on at the second stop. However, 7 people got off at the second stop. Therefore, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is x + 5 + 8 - 7.

Since we are given that there were 20 people heading to the third stop, we can set up the equation:

x + 5 + 8 - 7 = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 6 = 20

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get:

x = 14

Therefore, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, we can break down the events as follows:

1. Initially, Oscar has 24 lollipops.
2. He consumes 2 lollipops on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.
3. He distributes 14 lollipops to his friends, resulting in 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops remaining.
4. Oscar then acquires twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. This brings his total to 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He consumes 3 lollipops that night, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.
6. Finally, he consumes 2 more lollipops in the morning, resulting in 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

Therefore, Oscar has 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"To determine the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we can calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge. Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to charge 40% as follows:

Time = (40% / 1%) * 3 minutes
Time = 40 * 3 minutes
Time = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Time (hours) = 120 minutes / 60
Time (hours) = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Erin has left, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to add the initial number of lollipops Erin had to the number her mother gave her. This can be represented as 7 + 10. 

7 + 10 = 17

Next, we subtract the number of lollipops Erin gave to Ella from the total. This can be represented as 17 - 3.

17 - 3 = 14

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is 14."
"To calculate the amount the customer paid, we need to consider the rewards and the coupon discount. 

First, let's calculate the rewards earned. The customer spent $80 and received $1 off for every $20 spent. This can be expressed as $80 / 20 = 4. Since the rewards are $1 off for every $20, the total rewards earned is 4 * $1 = $4.

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the actual rewards they got is 4 * 2 = $8.

Now, subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: $80 - $8 = $72.

The customer paid $72 on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job provides a higher net pay, we must consider the tax implications of each option.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Total annual income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net pay, Job B offers a higher net pay rate of $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000.

The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To determine the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we can apply the concept of percentages and fractions. 

First, we need to calculate 40% of 220, which can be expressed as 0.4 * 220. 

0.4 * 220 = 88

Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we can express this as a fraction: 1/2. To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we multiply 88 by 1/2.

88 * (1/2) = 88/2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is 44."
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment for each offer.

Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

The cost difference between the two offers can be calculated by subtracting the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer from the total cost of Furniture United's offer:

"To calculate the final value of Maria's shares, we can break down the process into two steps: the increase in the first year and the decrease in the second year.

First, we calculate the increase in the first year. The stock price increases by 50%, which can be represented as a decimal by dividing by 2 (since 100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5). So, the increase is 0.5.

Next, we calculate the value of each share after the first year: $8 + (0.5 * $8) = $8 + $4 = $12.

Now, we calculate the decrease in the second year. The stock price decreases by 25%, which can be represented as a decimal by dividing by 4 (since 100% - 25% = 75%, or 0.75). So, the decrease is 0.25.

We then calculate the value of each share after the second year: $12 - (0.25 * $12) = $12 - $3 = $9.

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is: 8 * $9 = $72.

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To determine the number of hot dogs John ate more than Luke, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of hot dogs Luke ate as L and the number of hot dogs John ate as J.

We are given that Luke ate 2 hot dogs, so L = 2.

We also know that Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so the number of hot dogs Thomas ate is 3L = 3(2) = 6.

Furthermore, John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so J = (1/2)(6) = 3.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: J - L = 3 - 2 = 1.

Therefore, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. Since the two larger groups are equal in number, each of them has 200 - x students.

We are also given that the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups. This relationship can be expressed as:

200 - x = x - 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

200 = 2x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

210 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

105 = x

Therefore, the smallest group has 105 students.

Final Answer: The final answer is 105."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of cows as x. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combining like terms, we get:

3x = 60

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

x = 20

Now that we have the value of x, we can determine the number of chickens (2x) and calculate the total number of legs.

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. The total number of legs can be calculated as:

Total legs = (Number of cows * 4) + (Number of chickens * 2)
= (20 * 4) + (2 * 20)
= 80 + 40
= 120

Therefore, the total number of legs is 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the number of balls Josh has left to juggle, we need to consider the sequence of events. 

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1. 

The number of balls at the end of each week can be represented as: 
Week 1: 3
Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4
Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5
Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6

Since Josh drops 3 balls, and 2 are caught, he loses 1 ball. To find the number of balls he has left, we subtract 1 from the total at the end of the fourth week: 
6 - 1 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps and use basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the weight of the pink frog as P, the weight of the blue beetle as B, the weight of the green toad as T, the weight of the yellow snake as S, and the weight of the red bird as R. We are given the following information:

1. P = B
2. P = T
3. P = S - 10
4. P = R + 20

We are also given that the container weighs 20 pounds.

We can start by finding the weight of the yellow snake (S) using the third equation: S = P + 10. Since P = 50, we have S = 50 + 10 = 60.

Next, we can find the weight of the red bird (R) using the fourth equation: R = P - 20. Since P = 50, we have R = 50 - 20 = 30.

Now that we have the weights of all the animals, we can find the total weight of the container and the animals. The total weight is the sum of the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and the container, minus the weight of the red bird.

Total weight = P + B + T + S + 20 - R
= 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 20 - 30
= 200

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"

"To determine the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we can apply basic arithmetic operations.

Given that Juice Box A is $4, Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A, and Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A, we can calculate the prices as follows:

Juice Box B = Juice Box A + $5
Juice Box B = $4 + $5
Juice Box B = $9

Juice Box C = Juice Box A + $7
Juice Box C = $4 + $7
Juice Box C = $11

Now, we can find the difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B by subtracting the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C:

Difference = Juice Box C - Juice Box B
Difference = $11 - $9
Difference = $2

"To calculate the total number of legs, we can utilize the distributive property of multiplication. 

Let's break it down:

40 tables with 4 legs: 40 * 4 = 160 legs
50 tables with 3 legs: 50 * 3 = 150 legs

Now, we add the results together: 160 + 150 = 310 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs is 310."
"To determine the number of cookies Jenny eats, we must first calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

Her son's daily cookie consumption is 4 cookies, and he eats for 5 days, resulting in a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband's daily cookie consumption is 1 cookie, and he eats for 7 days, resulting in a total of 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The combined total of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag contains 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To calculate the total cost of the two shirts after applying a 40% discount, we can use the formula:

Total Cost = (Original Price - Discount) * Quantity

Given:
Original Price of one shirt = $30
Discount = 40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12
Quantity = 2

Total Cost = ($30 - $12) * 2
= $18 * 2
= $36

Therefore, the total cost of the two shirts is $36."
"To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue, we need to calculate the difference in revenue and then divide it by the original revenue.

The factory originally sold 10 tractors at $100 each, resulting in a daily revenue of 10 * $100 = $1000. Now, they sell 5 silos at $220 each, generating a daily revenue of 5 * $220 = $1100.

The difference in daily revenue is $1100 - $1000 = $100. To find the percentage increase, we'll divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

Final answer: 10"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the annual expenditure on dog care, comprising food, treats, and medicine. To derive the total monthly cost, we must first calculate the weekly expenditure on food and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

The weekly cost of food is $25, and there are 4 weeks in a month. Therefore, the monthly cost of food is:

$25 per week * 4 weeks per month = $100 per month

Next, we add the monthly cost of treats, which is $20, and the monthly cost of medicine, which is $100. The total monthly cost is:

$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220 per month

To determine the annual expenditure, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

$220 per month * 12 months per year = $2640 per year

The final answer is: $2640"
"To calculate the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we can break down the problem into individual components and apply basic arithmetic operations.

First, we need to determine the duration of each activity:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
- Wednesday: 0.5 hours
- Thursday: Half as long as the cooking class, so half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add the hours together: 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours

The total hours of Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we must first calculate the total number of pots required. Since she needs 30 pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses, we can express this as an equation:

Let's denote the number of pots for the daisies as D and the number of pots for the roses as R. We know that R = 2D and D = 30. Therefore, R = 2 * 30 = 60.

The total number of pots required is the sum of the pots for the daisies and roses: Total = D + R = 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April already had 100 plant pots, we can find the number of pots left over by subtracting the total number of pots required from the initial amount: 100 - 90 = 10.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To determine the amount Andrea saved, we can employ the concept of subtraction. Given that she spent $11 on a sweater and gave $4 to her brother, we can calculate the total amount spent as $11 + $4 = $15.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she had: $36 - $15 = $21.

Therefore, Andrea saved $21."
"To determine the total time John spent on vacation, we must first calculate the time spent on each activity. 

Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as 'x'. We know that John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, totaling 6 hours. These activities account for 30% of his total time.

We can express this as an equation: 0.3x = 15

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.3: x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50

Now that we know the total time spent on vacation, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing, which accounts for 40% of his total time. We can express this as: Time spent sightseeing = 0.4x
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount Annabelle still needs to save, we can calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add it to her initial savings.

Let's break down her earnings:

Her earnings from the first job: 20 hours * $10/hour = $200
Her earnings from the second job: 15 hours * $5/hour = $75
Total earnings: $200 + $75 = $275

Now, let's add her initial savings: $275 + $80 = $355

To find out how much she still needs to save, we subtract her total earnings and initial savings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45

The final answer is $45."
"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we can break down the problem into manageable steps. 

First, we know the height of the shortest tree is 6 feet. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height can be calculated as 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

Next, we need to find the combined height of the two shortest trees. This is simply the sum of their individual heights: 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

Now, we can find the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the combined height of the two shortest trees. This can be calculated as 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money Dean has left, we must first determine the total cost of the items he purchased. The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is 6 * $2 = $12. The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is 5 * $1 = $5. The total cost of the items is $12 + $5 = $17.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money Dean had: $28 - $17 = $11.

Finally, we add the extra $10 his mother gave him: $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is $21."
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wants to play once. So, the cost of mini-golf is $5.
The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice. So, the cost of the go-karts is $10 x 2 = $20.
The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The total cost of the activities is $5 + $20 + $5 = $30.

Now, we subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will cost $5 (the cost of a round of mini-golf), we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend: $60 ÷ $5 = 12.

Therefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total amount Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate the daily change and then multiply it by the number of days.

Daily pocket money: $5
Cost of each lollipop: $0.25
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4

First, calculate the total cost of lollipops per day:
4 * $0.25 = $1

Since Marisa saves the change, we need to find the daily change:
Daily pocket money - Total cost of lollipops = $5 - $1 = $4

Now, multiply the daily change by the number of days:
$4 * 5 = $20

Therefore, Marisa saves $20 in her piggy bank for 5 days.

Final answer: $20"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps to ensure accuracy.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Billy had initially. We know he had $10, and he spent $2 on gumballs. Therefore, the amount of money he had left is $10 - $2 = $8.

Since Billy spent $1.5 on candy, we can find the amount of money he had before buying the candy by adding the cost of the candy to the amount he had left: $8 + $1.5 = $9.5.

Now, we know that the candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought, we can divide the total amount of money he had before buying the candy ($9.5) by the cost per pound ($1.5):

$9.5 ÷ $1.5 = 6.33 pounds

Therefore, Billy bought 6.33 pounds of candy.

6.33"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S.

Given that Carver is 45 years old, we have the equation C = 45. We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, which can be expressed as C = 2S - 5.

Substituting C = 45 into the second equation, we get:

45 = 2S - 5

Now, let's solve for S by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2S
50 = 2S

Next, we'll divide both sides by 2 to isolate S:

S = 50 / 2
S = 25

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the number of days between services, we must first calculate the total distance traveled in one trip. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two).

The total distance of one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval:

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days.

To convert this to a more meaningful measure, we can express it as a fraction of a day. Since 0.0375 days is equivalent to 3/80 days, we can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3/80}$"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing needed, we must first calculate the average amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. This can be achieved by taking the arithmetic mean of the stuffing requirements for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.

The arithmetic mean of 8 and 2 is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5.

Since a collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds as 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Similarly, the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds is 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

To find the total amount of stuffing required, we add the amounts needed for the chihuahua and collie beds: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To calculate the total time taken for the trip, we need to consider the distance and speed for each leg of the journey and apply the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

For the trip to his friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

The detour added 10 miles to the trip, so the total distance to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. 
Time = 210 / 70 = 3.00 hours

For the return trip:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = 240 / 80 = 3.00 hours

Total time taken = 3.00 + 3.00 = 6.00 hours

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we can utilize the principle of set theory. We know that the total number of students is 96, and 43 of them are girls. The number of absent students is 9, consisting of 5 girls and 4 boys.

Let's denote the total number of boys as B. We can set up an equation based on the given information:

Total students = Number of girls + Number of boys
96 = 43 + B

To solve for B, we subtract 43 from both sides of the equation:

B = 96 - 43
B = 53

Therefore, the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 53.

The final answer is 53."
"To determine the total number of kids in the park, we can utilize the concept of ratios. Given that there are twice as many boys as girls, we can express this relationship as a ratio of boys to girls, which is 2:1. 

Since the total number of girls is 6, we can use this information to find the number of boys. 

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 6
Number of boys = 12

Now, we can calculate the total number of kids by adding the number of boys and girls.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 12 + 6
Total number of kids = 18

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we can utilize the concept of algebraic expressions. Let's represent the unknown points needed on the third test as 'x'. We know that the sum of the points from all three tests must be at least 42. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

15 + 18 + x ≥ 42

Simplifying the equation, we get:

33 + x ≥ 42

Subtracting 33 from both sides, we obtain:

x ≥ 9

Since we're looking for the minimum number of points, we can conclude that Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test to meet the requirement.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we can represent the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as 'x'. Then, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is 4x - 5, and the number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is 3(4x - 5).

We are given that the total number of customers kicked out is 50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms:

17x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

17x = 70

Divide both sides by 17:

x = 70/17
x = 4.117647058823529 (approximately)

Since x represents the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we can round it to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more accurate to keep the exact value.

Now, let's find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons:
Number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks: x = 70/17
Number of customers kicked out for shoplifting: 4x - 5 = 4(70/17) - 5
Number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale: 3(4x - 5) = 3(4(70/17) - 5)

To find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, we need to subtract the sum of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total number of customers kicked out:

50 - (70/17) - (4(70/17) - 5) - 3(4(70/17) - 5)

Simplify the expression:

50 - (70/17) - (280/17) + 5 - 3(280/17) + 15

Combine like terms:

50 - (70/17) - (280/17) + 5 - (840/17) + 15

Find a common denominator and combine:

50 - (1090/17) + 20

Combine the fractions:

(850/17) + 20

To add 20, convert it to a fraction with the same denominator:

(850/17) + (340/17)

Combine the fractions:

1190/17

To convert this to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator:

1190/17 ≈ 70.058823529

However, since the original question asked for the number of customers, we should keep the answer as a fraction or provide the closest whole number if necessary. In this case, we can keep the exact fraction.

The number of customers kicked out for other reasons is 1190/17."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of points Sara had before scoring as x. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara after scoring, we can express Erin's points as 3x + 14.

We are given that Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x + 14 = 14

Subtracting 14 from both sides gives us:

3x = 0

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 0

This implies that Sara had 0 points before scoring. Since Erin's points before scoring can be found by subtracting 14 from Erin's total points, we get:

Erin's points before = 3x + 14 - 14
Erin's points before = 3(0) + 0
Erin's points before = 0

The final answer is 0."
"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs:

1. Picture frames: 44 seniors * $20 per frame = $880
   Since each frame needs to be etched with a logo, we need to add 20% of the cost of the frame. 
   20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
   So, the total cost of the picture frames with etching is $880 + $4 = $884.

2. Pins: 2 seniors * $5 per pin = $10

3. Cords for officers: 1/4 of 44 seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   11 officers * $12 per cord = $132

Now, let's add up the costs:
$884 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1026

The total cost of the senior gifts is $1026."
"When calculating the cost of a DIY hand-painted wallpaper, it's essential to consider the discount as a percentage of the original cost. In this case, the discount is 20% of the original price.

To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = Original Cost - (Original Cost * Discount Percentage)

Plugging in the values, we get:

Total Cost = $400 - ($400 * 0.20)
Total Cost = $400 - $80
Total Cost = $320

Therefore, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To calculate the total number of tennis shoes sold, we can break down the sales by day and then account for the returns.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 × 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six pairs were returned, so we need to subtract those from the total.

Total number of shoes sold = 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returned) = 14 + 28 + 14 - 6

Using the associative and commutative properties of addition, we can rearrange the terms to simplify the calculation:

Total number of shoes sold = (14 + 28 + 14) - 6
= 56 - 6
= 50

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total hours of dance practice per week, we can calculate the hours for each day and add them together.

Hallie's dance practice consists of 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. On Saturdays, her practice is twice as long as Tuesday's class, so it is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Total hours per week = 1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours

Therefore, Hallie has 5 hours of dance practice per week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To calculate the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we can use the following steps:

First, we need to find the number of faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total number of pieces are faulty, we can calculate this as:

Number of faulty pieces = 40% of 400,000
= 0.4 * 400,000
= 160,000

Now, we can find the number of functioning pieces by subtracting the number of faulty pieces from the total number of pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = Total number of pieces - Number of faulty pieces
= 400,000 - 160,000
= 240,000

To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces, we can multiply the number of functioning pieces by the total amount spent:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = Number of functioning pieces * Total amount spent
= 240,000 * $400,000
= $96,000,000

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is $96,000,000."
"To determine the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic series. 

Let's break down the problem:

Mary has 30 sheep, which can be divided into two equal groups of 15 sheep each. 

The milk yield from each group is as follows:
- 1 kg of milk from 15 sheep
- 2 kg of milk from the other 15 sheep

To find the total milk yield, we can calculate the sum of the milk yield from each group:
15 * 1 + 15 * 2 = 15 + 30 = 45 kg

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"To determine the total number of pieces of rolls fed to the chickens, we can break down the problem into two steps. First, we need to find the number of rolls remaining after feeding the children, which is 12 - 6 = 6. Then, we multiply this result by 8 to find the total number of pieces, as each roll is broken into 8 pieces.

6 (remaining rolls) × 8 (pieces per roll) = 48

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens."
"To determine the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we find the number of pupils who like blue, which is half of the total class size: 40 / 2 = 20.

Next, we find the number of remaining pupils: 40 - 20 = 20.

Then, we calculate the number of pupils who like green, which is one-fourth of the remaining pupils: 20 / 4 = 5.

Finally, we find the number of pupils who like yellow by subtracting the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils: 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, the number of pupils who like yellow is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into three separate equations based on the information provided.

Let's denote the number of apples picked on Monday as M, Tuesday as T, and Wednesday as W. We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece, so we can write the equation:

M = 56 / 4
M = 14

We also know that Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday, so T = 12.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, so W = 2T = 2(12) = 24.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked by adding the number of apples picked on each day: M + T + W = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we must first calculate the total number of socks she has washed. Since she washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair consists of 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks. Additionally, she washed 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Now, to find the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the total number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks that need washing. This can be expressed as 50 - 35.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of cookies left for Rachel, we must consider the sequence of events that affected the total count.

First, we add the initial number of cookies Rachel had to the number of cookies Janet gave her: 23 + 42 = 65.

"To calculate Karan's monthly payment, we can use the formula for calculating monthly payments on a loan:

M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n - 1]

where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal amount = $3,650
i = monthly interest rate = 10%/12 = 0.008333
n = number of payments = 5 months

Plugging in the values, we get:

M = $3,650 [ 0.008333(1 + 0.008333)^5 ] / [ (1 + 0.008333)^5 - 1]
M = $3,650 [ 0.008333(1.008333)^5 ] / (1.008333)^5 - 1]
M = $3,650 [ 0.008333(1.043383) ] / 1.043383 - 1]
M = $3,650 [ 0.008745 ] / 1.043383 - 1]
M = $3,650 [ 0.008745 ] / 0.043383]
M = $83.33

The monthly payment Karan has to make is approximately $83.33."
"To determine the distance each individual hiked, we can apply the formula: distance = speed × time.

For Cho, the distance hiked is 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km.

For Chloe, the distance hiked is 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km.

To find the difference in the distances hiked, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance: 112 km - 45 km = 67 km.

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 km farther than Chloe."
"To determine the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they possess.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To calculate Millie's profit per hour, we need to first determine the total revenue and total cost. 

The total revenue is the number of cups sold multiplied by the selling price per cup. Since she sells 4 cups per hour and she sells all 36 cups, the total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

The total cost is the initial investment, which is $18.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $36 - $18 = $18.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 ÷ 9 hours = $2 per hour.

Therefore, Millie's profit per hour is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportions. Let's denote the original amount of land as x hectares. Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had is 32 hectares.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the number of people who can perform, we first need to calculate the total number of female members in the choir. Given that 50% of the 52 members are girls, we can calculate this as 0.5 * 52 = 26.

Since the choir is performing with just the female members, the total number of people performing is the number of girls (26) plus the 3 teachers, which equals 26 + 3 = 29.

To find the number of people who can perform, we need to subtract the number of people who cannot make it due to the bus breakdown. Half of the total number of people performing is 29 / 2 = 14.5. However, since we cannot have half a person, we will round down to 14 people who cannot make it.

The number of people who can perform is 29 - 14 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To calculate Wilson's current math grade, we need to find the average of his 5 test scores. This can be achieved by summing up the scores and dividing by the number of tests.

Let's denote the sum of the scores as S and the number of tests as n. We have:

S = 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74
S = 400

The average (A) can be calculated using the formula: A = S / n
A = 400 / 5
A = 80

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80."
"To calculate the total cost, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. 

First, we multiply the number of erasers by the cost of one eraser: 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, we multiply the number of pencils by the cost of one pencil: 8 * $3 = $24.

Finally, we add the two amounts together: $12 + $24 = $36.

Therefore, the total cost is $36."
"To calculate the total number of messages James delivers, we can utilize the concept of proportional reasoning. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can express this relationship as a fraction.

Let's denote the number of messages to Ms. Thompson as x. Then, the number of messages to Mr. Yu is 1/3x.

We are given that the number of messages to Ms. Thompson is 66, so we can set up the equation:

x = 66

Now, we can find the number of messages to Mr. Yu by multiplying x by 1/3:

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
= 22

To find the total number of messages, we add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:

Total number of messages = x + (1/3x)
= 66 + 22
= 88

Therefore, James delivers a total of 88 messages."
"To determine the amount David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying 9 ride tickets and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. 

So, David saves $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, David saves $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the amount of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts. 

The total number of gifts is the sum of gifts for family, friends, and teachers, which is 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts.

Now, we divide the total amount of ribbon (144 inches) by the total number of gifts (12):

144 ÷ 12 = 12 inches per gift

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

Final answer: 12"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of equivalent ratios. The given ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. Let's represent the number of popsicles Betty has as 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has as 6x, where x is a common multiplier.

We know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. We can set up an equation to represent this:

5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms:

11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 15

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:

Betty: 5x = 5(15) = 75
Sam: 6x = 6(15) = 90

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

90 - 75 = 15

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is 15."
"To calculate the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to consider the discounted cost of the streaming services.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month.

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling. To find the discounted cost, we calculate 20% of $10, which is $2. Subtracting this from the original cost, we get $10 - $2 = $8 per month for the bundled services.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.

To find the amount of money Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42

Therefore, Tim saves $42 per month by cancelling his cable package.

The final answer is: $42"
"To calculate the percentage of time spent editing, we need to first determine the total work time. The time spent writing is 4 hours, the time spent recording is 1.5 hours, and the time spent editing is 1.5 hours.

Total work time = 4 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the editing time by the total work time and multiply by 100:

(1.5 / 7) * 100 = 21.43%

This can be expressed as a percentage, which is 21.43%."
"To determine the total number of books Wendy needs, we can represent the situation algebraically. Let's denote the number of books in each row as 'r' and the number of rows as 'n'. We're given that there are 6 rows, so n = 6.

The total capacity of the shelving system is the product of the number of books in each row and the number of rows, which is 6r.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so we can represent this as 2(6r) + 20.

Since we know the total capacity is 36, we can set up the equation:

2(6r) + 20 = 36

Simplifying the equation, we get:

12r + 20 = 36

Subtracting 20 from both sides:

12r = 16

Dividing both sides by 12:

r = 16/12
r = 4/3

Now that we know the number of books in each row (4/3), we can find the total number of books Wendy needs:

Total books = 2(6r) + 20
= 2(6 * (4/3))
= 2 * 8
= 16 + 20
= 36

However, this is the capacity of the shelving system. To find the number of books Wendy needs to carry, we need to find the number of books she wants to place, which is 20 more than double the number of books in the system. Since the system's capacity is 36, we can represent this as:

Number of books Wendy needs = 2(36) + 20
= 72 + 20
= 92

The final answer is: $\boxed{92}$"
"To determine the total number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we must consider the initial number of cards she made, the number of cards she received from her dad, and the number of cards she gave away.

Let's break down the information:

- Erica initially made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, each containing 15 cards. This results in a total of 2 x 15 = 30 cards.
- Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards given away.

Now, we can calculate the total number of cards Erica now has by adding the initial cards, the cards from her dad, and subtracting the cards she gave away:

20 (initial cards) + 30 (cards from her dad) - 29 (cards given away) = 21

Therefore, Erica now has 21 Valentine's Day cards.

21"
"To determine the number of slices left, we need to calculate the total number of slices given away and subtract that from the initial number of slices.

Jenny gave 1/3 of 12 slices to Bill, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices. 
She gave 1/4 of 12 slices to Mark, which is (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny started with 12 slices and gave away 7, so she has 12 - 7 = 5 slices left.

However, Jenny also ate 2 slices. To find the final number of slices left, we need to subtract 2 from 5.

The final number of slices left is 5 - 2 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the number of days Mark needs to save for the bike, we can use the formula for simple interest:

Number of days = Total amount / Daily earnings

In this case, the total amount is $300 (the cost of the bike) and the daily earnings are $10.

Number of days = $300 / $10
Number of days = 30

Therefore, Mark needs 30 days to save enough money to buy the bike."
"To determine the total number of bugs, we must first calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs.

The number of millipedes is 1/3 of the number of spiders. Since there are 90 spiders, we can express this as a fraction: 1/3 * 90 = 30 millipedes.

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. We can represent this as an expression: 2 * 30 - 12.

Now, let's calculate the number of stink bugs: 2 * 30 = 60, then subtract 12: 60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs.

To find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

Therefore, the total number of bugs is 168."
"To find the difference in age between Alice and Erica, we can represent their ages algebraically. Let's denote Erica's age as E, Beth's age as B, and Alice's age as A.

Given that Erica is 30 years old, we have E = 30.

Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can express Beth's age as B = E + 5.

Substituting E = 30 into the equation, we get B = 30 + 5 = 35.

Now, we know that Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so we can express Alice's age as A = B + 7.

Substituting B = 35 into the equation, we get A = 35 + 7 = 42.

The difference in age between Alice and Erica is A - E = 42 - 30 = 12.

Therefore, the difference in age between Alice and Erica is 12 years."
"To calculate the total calories consumed, we can apply the formula: Total Calories = Number of Glasses × Ounces per Glass × Calories per Ounce.

Given:
Number of Glasses = 2
Ounces per Glass = 8
Calories per Ounce = 3

Total Calories = 2 × 8 × 3
Total Calories = 48

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories."
"To calculate the builder's annual earnings, we can multiply the number of working days in a year by the daily wage.

First, we need to determine the total number of working days in a year. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, and the builder works 6 days a week, we can calculate the total number of working days as follows:

Total working days = 52 weeks/year * 6 days/week = 312 days/year

Next, we can multiply the total number of working days by the daily wage to find the annual earnings:

Annual earnings = Total working days * Daily wage
= 312 days/year * $50/day
= $15,600/year

Therefore, the builder's annual earnings are $15,600.

Final answer: $15,600"
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we can apply the concept of proportional scaling. Since the normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk, and Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply these quantities by 4.

Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide 12 by 2 to get the number of bags: 12 / 2 = 6 bags

Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups
Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide 4 by 2 to get the number of bottles: 4 / 2 = 2 bottles

To find the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the energy saved, we need to first find the total energy used in 30 days at the original usage rate.

The original energy usage per day is 900 watts, and Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day. Therefore, the total energy usage per day is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh).

The total energy usage in 30 days is 7200 Wh * 30 = 216,000 Wh.

Now, let's find the new energy usage per day after reducing the usage by 5 hours. The new energy usage per day is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh.

The total energy usage in 30 days at the new rate is 2700 Wh * 30 = 81,000 Wh.

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new energy usage: 216,000 Wh - 81,000 Wh = 135,000 Wh.

To convert Wh to kWh, we divide by 1000: 135,000 Wh / 1000 = 135 kWh.

The energy saved in 30 days is 135 kWh * 30 = 4050 kWh.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4050}$"
"To calculate the average number of stripes, we must first determine the total number of stripes. The first two zebras have 17 stripes each, so their combined total is 2 x 17 = 34. The third zebra has 36 stripes, and the fourth zebra has half that amount, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, we add up the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

Therefore, the average number of stripes is 22."
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese for 20 people, we can break down the problem into two components: the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese.

First, let's calculate the total amount of each required. Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need:

- 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, let's calculate the cost of the meat and cheese. The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00. The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining variables for the number of cannolis and corns. Let's denote the number of cannolis as C and the number of corns as K.

We are given that there are twice as many corns as cannolis, so we can write an equation: K = 2C.

We also know that Allan initially had 40 cannolis, so C = 40.

Substituting C = 40 into the equation K = 2C, we get K = 2(40) = 80.

Next, we are told that Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is C + 60 = 40 + 60 = 100.

We are also told that he bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis, so the new total number of corns is K - 40 = 80 - 40 = 40.

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis: C + K = 100 + 40 = 140.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of steps taken during the jog as 'x'. We know that Elliott completed 5,000 steps on his walks to and from school and an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, resulting in a total of 6,000 steps before his jog. After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take, which means the total steps taken during the jog, plus the remaining steps, should equal 10,000.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

6,000 + x + 2,000 = 10,000

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8,000 + x = 10,000

Subtracting 8,000 from both sides yields:

x = 2,000

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

The final answer is: 2,000"
"To determine the time it will take Toby to finish the book, we can utilize the formula: Time = Total Words / Reading Rate.

Given that the book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, the total number of words is 45 * 200 = 9000 words. Toby's reading rate is 300 words per minute. 

Time = Total Words / Reading Rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes.

Considering Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to finish the book, we can calculate the time he will arrive early as follows:

Time to arrive early = Total Time Required - Time to finish the book = 60 minutes - 30 minutes = 30 minutes.

Therefore, Toby will arrive 30 minutes early at the airport."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to consider the number of employees and their hourly wage.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. This can be represented as:

Total amount paid in May = Number of employees * Hourly wage * Number of hours worked
= 40 * $15 * 40
= $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, leaving 3/4 of the employees. The number of employees in June is 3/4 * 40 = 30. The company paid 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000.

The total amount paid in the two months is $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000.

The final answer is: $42,000"
"To determine the amount of money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

The taffy was on sale, so the cost of 2 pounds is $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound. We can express this as an equation: 2(3 + 1.50/2). Simplifying, we get 2(3 + 0.75) = 2(3.75) = $7.50.

The mixed bag of seashells cost $1.50, and the 4 magnets cost 4 x $0.25 = $1. The total cost of the items is $7.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $10.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $10 = $0 left.

$0"
"To calculate the total amount Tim spent, we need to determine the cost of the two packages of fireworks and add the cost of the finale firework.

The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice as much, which is 2 x $400 = $800. The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

To calculate the discount, we need to find 20% of $1200. This can be calculated as 0.20 x $1200 = $240. 

The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we can use the following calculation:

Number of cookies needed = Total number of cookies consumed in 30 days
= 2 cookies/night * 30 nights
= 60 cookies

Since 1 dozen = 12 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies needed by 12 to find the number of dozens:

Number of dozens = Total number of cookies needed / 12
= 60 cookies / 12
= 5

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the intersection of the two events. We are given that 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, and we want to find the percentage of these candles that also explode.

Let's denote the total number of candles as N = 50,000. The number of candles that smell like wet dog is 5% of N, which is 0.05N. However, we don't know the percentage of these candles that explode. Let's denote the percentage of candles that explode as p. Then, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 0.05Np.

Since we don't have information about the value of p, we cannot directly calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, we can express the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode as a percentage of the total number of candles:

(0.05Np) / N = 0.05p

To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need more information about the value of p. Without additional information, we cannot provide a numerical answer.

However, if we assume that the 5% of candles that smell like wet dog are also the ones that explode (as mentioned in the original response), we can calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode as:

0.05 x 50,000 = 2,500

This is an assumption, and the actual number may be different.

2,500"
"To calculate the total cost of the discounted blouses, we can apply the concept of percentage discount. The formula for finding the discount amount is:

Discount = (Discount Percentage / 100) × Regular Price

In this case, the discount percentage is 30% and the regular price is $20. Plugging in the values, we get:

Discount = (30 / 100) × $20
= 0.30 × $20
= $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price:

Discounted Price = Regular Price - Discount
= $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

Total Cost = Number of Blouses × Discounted Price
= 4 × $14
= $56

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples from the average trees as A.

We are given the following information:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.
2. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2T = 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
3. Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as her sister, so S = 2S. Since Joanne gathers 30 apples from the shortest trees, her sister gathers 3S = 3 * 30 = 90 apples from the shortest trees.
4. The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so T + S + A = 500.

We can rewrite the equation for the shortest trees as S = 30, since Joanne gathers 30 apples from the shortest trees.

Now, substitute the values of T and S into the total equation:

30 + 30 + A = 500

Combine like terms:

60 + A = 500

Subtract 60 from both sides:

A = 440

Therefore, Joanne gathers 440 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{440}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of heads is 180, which translates to the equation: c + d = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304, considering camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, we get the equation: 2c + d = 304.

We can solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to find the values of 'c' and 'd'.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of 'c' in both equations:

2c + 2d = 360

Now, we can subtract the second equation from this new equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + 2d) - (2c + d) = 360 - 304
d = 56

Now that we have found 'd', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find 'c':

c + d = 180
c + 56 = 180
c = 124

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is 56.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break it down into parts.

First, we need to find the total distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. Since he traveled 200 kilometers per day, the total distance is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, we need to find 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days. To do this, we multiply 800 km by 0.3:
800 km * 0.3 = 240 km

Now, we add the distance traveled in the first 4 days and the distance traveled in the next 2 days:
800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

Since Tom wasn't traveling on the 7th day, we don't need to include it in our calculation.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we add the distances traveled in the first 6 days and the second week:
1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 km."
"To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we can utilize the given information about the relative sizes of the lockers. We know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. 

First, we can express this relationship as an equation: 
Peter's locker size = (1/4) * Zack's locker size
5 cubic inches = (1/4) * Zack's locker size

To solve for Zack's locker size, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate Zack's locker size:
Zack's locker size = 5 cubic inches * 4
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker size, we can find Timothy's locker size, which is half as big as Zack's locker:
Timothy's locker size = (1/2) * Zack's locker size
Timothy's locker size = (1/2) * 20 cubic inches
Timothy's locker size = 10 cubic inches

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the elevation at which Oliver must climb to reach Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference in elevation between the two points.

The elevation of Stanley's comb is the sum of Stanley's elevation and the distance the comb fell: 10,000 feet + 4,000 feet = 14,000 feet.

Now, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the elevation of Stanley's comb to find the difference: 14,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 11,000 feet.

Therefore, Oliver must climb 11,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To determine the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate the amount received from the second bank, which is twice the amount received from the first bank. This can be expressed as 2 * $4000. 

The total capital is the sum of the initial capital, the amount received from the first bank, and the amount received from the second bank. This can be represented as: 

$5000 + $4000 + (2 * $4000)

Using the order of operations, we first calculate the expression within the parentheses: 2 * $4000 = $8000. 

Now, we can rewrite the expression as: 

$5000 + $4000 + $8000

Next, we add the numbers: $5000 + $4000 = $9000, then $9000 + $8000 = $17000.

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of $17000.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To solve this problem, we need to apply the principles of arithmetic and fraction operations. 

First, we'll calculate the number of cats carried away by the boats. Since each boat carried 5 cats, and there were 4 boats, the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

Next, we'll find 3/5 of the remaining cats. To do this, we'll multiply the remaining cats (50 - 20 = 30) by 3/5. This can be expressed as (30 * 3) / 5.

Now, we'll calculate the result of the multiplication: 30 * 3 = 90. Then, we'll divide the result by 5: 90 / 5 = 18.

Finally, we'll subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

Therefore, there are 12 cats left on the rock.

The final answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we can break it down into three distinct periods based on the pricing structure.

The first 6 months are priced at $8 per month, resulting in a total of $8 * 6 = $48.

The next 8 months are priced at $12 per month, resulting in a total of $12 * 8 = $96.

The final 8 months are priced at $14 per month, resulting in a total of $14 * 8 = $112.

To find the total cost of 2 years, we add the costs of these three periods: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256.

Therefore, the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service is $256."
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables and setting up the equation. Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

We know that Cole saved a total of $6, and 1/3 of the total savings came from the jogger jeans. This means 2/3 of the total savings came from the tattered jeans. We can set up the equation:

(2/3)(x + 6) + (1/3)x = 6

To simplify the equation, we can first multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fractions:

2(x + 6) + x = 18

Expanding the left side of the equation, we get:

2x + 12 + x = 18

Combine like terms:

3x + 12 = 18

Subtract 12 from both sides:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $2, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

Original price of tattered jeans = x + 6
= 2 + 6
= 8

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:

Original price of tattered jeans - Original price of jogger jeans
= 8 - 2
= 6

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the total capacity of the vehicles, we can calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

The capacity of the buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

Let's break it down:

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and Lillian bought 3 of them. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 × 20 = 60.

The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, which means they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. She built 3 of these feeders, so the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 × 30 = 90.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see, we add the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders and the homemade feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day."
"To calculate the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we can break down the costs of each item.

The bagel costs $4, and the soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25, which equals $1. Therefore, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of cards Kenny started with as x. Since he keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of them. The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is then 2/3 * $1.5 = $1.

We can set up the equation:

1/3x = 50

To isolate x, we can multiply both sides by 3:

x = 50 * 3

x = 150

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To solve this problem, we can apply the concept of fractional parts. Let's break it down step by step:

Let's denote the total number of guests as T, the number of guests prepared for two hotdogs as G2, and the number of guests who received two hotdogs as G2'. We are given that T = 36 and G2 = T/2.

Since everyone who showed up received a second hotdog, we can set up the equation:

G2' = T

Now, we can substitute the value of T and G2:

G2' = 36

We also know that the number of guests who received only one hotdog is the difference between the total number of guests and the number of guests who received two hotdogs:

G1 = T - G2'

Substituting the values, we get:

G1 = 36 - 36
G1 = 0

However, this is not possible, as we know that some guests did not receive a second hotdog. Let's re-examine the problem.

Since the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can assume that the caterer prepared 2G2 hotdogs in total. This means that the remaining hotdogs (T - 2G2) were enough for the remaining guests to have one hotdog each.

We can set up the equation:

T - 2G2 = G1

Substituting the values, we get:

36 - 2(18) = G1
36 - 36 = G1
0 = G1

This still doesn't make sense, as we know that some guests did not receive a second hotdog. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Since everyone who showed up received a second hotdog, we can set up the equation:

G2' = T
G2' = 40

We know that G2 = T/2, so we can substitute the value of T:

G2 = 36/2
G2 = 18

Now, we can find the number of guests who received only one hotdog:

G1 = T - G2'
G1 = 40 - 18
G1 = 22

Therefore, 22 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name, we can employ basic arithmetic operations.

First, we calculate half of the letters in Indras' name. Since her name has 6 letters, we can express this as:

6 ÷ 2 = 3

This result represents the number of letters in half of Indras' name. To find the number of letters in her sister's name, we add 4 to this result:

3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the total number of letters in both names by adding the number of letters in Indras' name (6) and her sister's name (7):

6 + 7 = 13

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13.

The final answer is 13."
"To calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order, we can apply the concept of percentage discount. The formula for finding the discount amount is:

Discount = (Discount Percentage / 100) * Total Cost

In this case, the discount percentage is 20% and the total cost is $165.00.

Discount = (20 / 100) * $165.00
= 0.20 * $165.00
= $33.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount:

Final Amount = Total Cost - Discount
= $165.00 - $33.00
= $132.00

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"To determine the amount of money Dora needs to purchase the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball, we must first calculate the total cost of the items. 

The total cost is the sum of the individual costs: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18.

To find the amount of money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

The final answer is $1."
"To determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we can analyze the given information step by step.

First, we know that Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Then, Prince Arthur, who used a spear, slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. This can be expressed as a fraction: 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Next, we're told that Prince Walter, using a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. This can be calculated as 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Finally, Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. This can be calculated as 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the amount of gasoline Josey needed, we must first convert the fraction of the container she used to a decimal. Since there are 5 containers, 1/4 of a container is equivalent to 1/5 of the total amount.

15 gallons * 1/5 = 15/5 = 3 gallons

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert 3 gallons to pints by multiplying by 8.

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 24 pints of gasoline.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of candy bars George bought as 'x'. We know that he spent a total of $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. Since he had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of his money, which is 500 - (500 x 1%) = 495 cents.

We also know that he spent 120 cents on chips. Therefore, the amount he spent on candy bars is 495 - 120 = 375 cents. Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can set up the equation:

75x = 375

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 75:

x = 375 / 75
x = 5

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of lollipops each friend received, we can employ the concept of division. Given that Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, the remaining lollipops are shared equally among his four friends.

Let's calculate the number of lollipops each friend received:

25 (total lollipops) - 5 (lollipops kept by Ray) = 20

Now, we divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends:

20 ÷ 4 = 5

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we can apply the concept of division to find the weight of each piece and then subtract the total weight of the pieces from the original weight of the cake.

Given that the cake is cut into 8 equal pieces, we can calculate the weight of each piece by dividing the total weight of the cake (20 ounces) by the number of pieces (8).

Weight of each piece = Total weight of the cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, the total weight of the pieces they had is 2 * 2.5 = 5 ounces.

Weight of the remaining cake = Total weight of the cake - Total weight of the pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5
Weight of the remaining cake = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To determine the number of oranges each person will receive, we must first calculate the total number of oranges and then divide it by the total number of people.

The total number of oranges is the sum of Sitti's and Juris's oranges: 34 + 22 = 56.

Next, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people, which is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends).

Total oranges ÷ Total people = 56 ÷ 8 = 7

Therefore, each person will receive 7 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To calculate the cost per serving, we must first determine the total cost of the ingredients. Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, which are on sale for $2.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost of the onions is 2 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $4.00.

Additionally, Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, also on sale for $2.00 per box. The total cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $4.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $8.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $8.00 / 6 = $1.33.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $1.

The final answer is $1."
"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we need to calculate the time difference between her drive and Wayne's drive. 

Let's denote the time it takes Wayne to drive to the theater as W and the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater as B. We know that B = 4W, and W = 4 minutes. 

Substituting W into the equation B = 4W, we get B = 4(4) = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she should leave 16 - 5 = 11 minutes earlier than Wayne.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we must first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. To find the width, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width.

360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we can calculate the total number of beads each one has.

Elizabeth's total beads = 1 (red) + 2 * 20 (clear) = 41
Margareth's total beads = 3 (blue) + 4 * 20 (red) = 83

The difference in the number of beads between the two sisters can be found by subtracting Elizabeth's total beads from Margareth's total beads:
83 - 41 = 42

Therefore, Margareth has 42 more beads than Elizabeth."
"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we must consider the cumulative effects of the temperature changes. 

First, we calculate the temperature increase due to baking. The oven's temperature rise is 5 degrees per hour, and it operates for 3 hours. Therefore, the total temperature increase is:

ΔT_baking = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees

Next, we calculate the cooling effect. The window's cooling rate is 2 degrees per 10 minutes, and it remains open for 30 minutes. To find the total cooling effect, we first convert the cooling rate to degrees per hour:

Cooling rate = 2 degrees/10 minutes = 0.2 degrees/minute
Cooling rate (per hour) = 0.2 degrees/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 12 degrees/hour

Now, we calculate the total cooling effect:

ΔT_cooling = Cooling rate (per hour) * Cooling time (hours) = 12 degrees/hour * 0.5 hours = 6 degrees

Finally, we find the final temperature by adding the initial temperature to the temperature increase and subtracting the cooling effect:

T_final = T_initial + ΔT_baking - ΔT_cooling
= 40 degrees + 15 degrees - 6 degrees
= 49 degrees

The final answer is 49."
"To determine James' run time, we must first calculate the time it took him to complete each part of the triathlon.

Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, and James finishes the swim 10% faster. To find James' swim time, we can calculate 10% of 40 and subtract it from 40.

James' swim time = 40 - (40 * 0.1)
= 40 - 4
= 36 minutes

Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, and James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike. To find James' bike time, we can add 5 minutes to Jon's bike time.

James' bike time = 80 + 5
= 85 minutes

Jon's run time is 50 minutes, and we need to find James' run time. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for Jon is 10 minutes less than James'. We can set up an equation:

40 + 80 + 50 = 36 + 85 + x - 10

Combine like terms:
170 = 111 + x

Subtract 111 from both sides:
59 = x

Therefore, James' run time is 59 minutes.

The final answer is 59."
"To determine the length of Movie A, we must first convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. 

We know that 1 hour is equivalent to 60 minutes. Therefore, we can convert 1.25 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:

1.25 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Next, we are given that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, the length of Movie B is:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can express this relationship as a fraction:

Movie A = (1/4) × Movie B

Substituting the length of Movie B, we get:

Movie A = (1/4) × 80 minutes
Movie A = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total cost of the hay, we must first calculate the total amount of hay consumed. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, and the horse runs 16 miles, the total amount of hay consumed is:

8 bails

"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we must first calculate the total number of eggs she has. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, we get a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Now, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold, which is 5. This can be represented as 50 ÷ 5.

50 ÷ 5 = 10

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 10 trays of eggnog."
"To determine the current score difference between Joey and Marcy, we must first calculate their new scores after the game.

Joey's initial score is 214 points. He scores 26 points, resulting in a new score of 214 + 26 = 240 points.

Marcy's initial score is 225 points. She scores 10 points, resulting in a new score of 225 + 10 = 235 points.

Now, we can find the difference between their scores by subtracting Marcy's score from Joey's score: 240 - 235 = 5 points.

Therefore, Joey is winning by 5 points.

"To calculate the salesman's profit, we can break down the problem into two parts: the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the remaining sneakers sold to the department store.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale:

Revenue from flash sale = Number of sneakers sold at $20 * $20
= 17 * $20
= $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the remaining sneakers sold to the department store:

Number of sneakers left = Total sneakers - Sneakers sold at $20
= 48 - 17
= 31

Revenue from remaining sneakers = Number of sneakers left * $25
= 31 * $25
= $775

Now, we can calculate the total revenue:

Total revenue = Revenue from flash sale + Revenue from remaining sneakers
= $340 + $775
= $1115

Finally, we can calculate the profit:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $1115 - $576
= $539

The final answer is: $539"
"To determine the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we can employ the concept of weighted averages. We have two types of packets: six packets with 8 colors each and four packets with 16 colors each.

Let's calculate the total number of colors by multiplying the number of packets by the number of colors in each type and then adding them together:

Total colors = (6 packets * 8 colors/packet) + (4 packets * 16 colors/packet)
Total colors = 48 + 64
Total colors = 112

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

112"
"To determine the regular price of popcorn, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as x.

The cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $17, which is the cost of the movie ticket ($12) plus the cost of the popcorn and soda ($5). We can express this as:

12 + x + 3 = 17

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 3 = 5

Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get:

x = 2

Therefore, the regular price of popcorn is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we can utilize the concept of unitary method. 

First, we need to find the cost of filling one balloon after the price increase. The original cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, so the cost of filling one balloon is $900 / 20 = $45. After the price increase, the cost of filling each balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons: 170 x $65 = $11,050.

The final answer is: $11,050"
"To calculate the average speed of the car, we can use the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

Given:
- Distance covered at 60 mph for 2 hours = 60 * 2 = 120 miles
- Distance covered at 30 mph for 1 hour = 30 * 1 = 30 miles
- Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles
- Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

Therefore, the car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"To determine the total value of Jenna's jewels, we can calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

First, we need to find the value of the sapphires she has left. Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3, so she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

Next, we need to find the value of the rubies she received. Jenna received 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is the sum of the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To calculate the total number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy in 30 days, we can utilize the concept of multiplication. Since both individuals consume 4 apples per day, we can multiply this daily consumption by the number of days.

The total number of apples eaten can be calculated as follows:

4 apples/day × 30 days = 120 apples

Therefore, Marin and Nancy will eat a total of 120 apples in 30 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total volume of soil required, we must first calculate the volume of a single raised bed. Given that the bed's dimensions are 2 feet in width, 8 feet in length, and 2 feet in height, we can apply the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

Volume = length x width x height
= 8 ft x 2 ft x 2 ft
= 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 10 x 32 cubic feet = 320 cubic feet.

Now, we need to find the number of bags of potting soil required. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so we divide the total volume needed by the volume per bag:

Number of bags = Total volume / Volume per bag
= 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet
= 160 bags

Finally, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

Total cost = Number of bags x Cost per bag
= 160 bags x $12/bag
= $1920

The final answer is: $1920"
"To determine the total number of cards, we need to calculate the number of green cards first. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can express this as:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + (60% of Number of red cards)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know the number of red cards (15), green cards (24), and yellow cards (which is the sum of red and green cards).

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

Therefore, the total number of cards is 78."
"To determine the number of fairies remaining, we can break down the problem into three distinct intervals of time.

Initially, Katelyn observed 50 fairies. Twenty minutes later, 25 more fairies arrived from the east, increasing the total to 50 + 25 = 75 fairies. Ten minutes after that, 30 fairies departed, leaving 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to calculate the total number of puppies and the number of puppies with spots.

The total number of puppies is the sum of the puppies from Jennifer's dog and Brandon's dog: 8 + 12 = 20.

The number of puppies with spots is the sum of the puppies with spots from Jennifer's dog and Brandon's dog: 3 + 4 = 7.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100: (7 / 20) * 100.

This can be calculated as 35%.

Therefore, the percentage of puppies with spots is 35%."
"To determine the total weight of the feed, we must calculate the weight of each item and add them together.

The weight of the sugar cubes is 2 pounds, the weight of the carrots is 48 pounds, the weight of the hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds, and the weight of the oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds. 

The total weight of the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4400 pounds.

To find the number of trips required to transport the feed, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck: 4400 / 2250.

This calculation yields 1.96. Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, we must round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the farmer will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate Grayson's monthly earnings from recycling, we need to first determine her weekly earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles. 

Let's break it down:

Aluminum cans: 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week
Plastic bottles: 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total weekly earnings = 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4:

Total monthly earnings = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month

Therefore, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the number of plants Shondra has, we can apply the concept of percentages and basic arithmetic operations.

First, we need to calculate 60% of Frederick's plants, which is the increase in the number of plants Toni has compared to Frederick. 

60% of 10 plants = 0.6 * 10 = 6

Now, we add this increase to Frederick's number of plants to find Toni's total:
Toni's plants = 10 + 6 = 16

Since Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, we subtract 7 from Toni's total:
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7 = 9

The final answer is 9."
"To calculate the total amount of money Ali has now, we need to determine Leila's contribution to his initial amount. Since Leila gave Ali half of her $100, we can calculate this as follows:

Leila's contribution = 1/2 * $100 = $50

Now, we add this amount to Ali's initial amount:

Total amount = $21 (Ali's initial amount) + $50 (Leila's contribution)
= $21 + $50
= $71

Therefore, Ali now has a total of $71."
"To calculate the total amount Ashley should give as a tip, we can use the formula:

Total Tip Amount = (Cost of Pizza) * (Tip Percentage / 100)

In this case, the cost of the pizza is $15 and the tip percentage is 1/5, which can be converted to a decimal by dividing by 5: 1/5 = 0.2.

Total Tip Amount = $15 * (0.2 / 1) = $15 * 0.2 = $3

Therefore, Ashley should give the delivery man a total of $15 + $3 = $18.

The final answer is $18."
"To determine Finley's final position, we can analyze her movements step by step:

Finley started in 1st place and fell back 5 spots, which means she was in 6th place. Then, she moved ahead 2 spots, placing her in 4th position. After that, she fell behind 3 spots, resulting in a position of 7th place. Finally, she jumped ahead 1 spot, which means she ended in 6th place.

This problem can be represented mathematically as follows:

Let's denote Finley's initial position as P0 = 1, the number of spots she fell back as F1 = 5, the number of spots she moved ahead as M1 = 2, the number of spots she fell behind as F2 = 3, and the number of spots she jumped ahead as M2 = 1.

We can calculate Finley's final position using the following formula:

P = P0 + (M1 - F1) - F2 + M2

P = 1 + (2 - 5) - 3 + 1
P = 1 - 2 - 3 + 1
P = -3

Since we cannot have a negative position, we need to adjust the calculation to account for the initial position. We can do this by adding the initial position to the result:

P = -3 + 1
P = -2 + 1
P = -1 + 1
P = 0 + 1
P = 1

However, since we are dealing with a 100-meter race, a negative position doesn't make sense. We can add the total number of participants (100) to the result to get the final position:

P = 1 + 100
P = 101

Therefore, Finley finished in 101st place.

101"
"To determine the number of students Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she has and then divide that by the number of cards each student received.

Miss Maria has 6 decks of basketball cards, with 25 cards in each deck, and 5 boxes of baseball cards, with 40 cards in each box. We can calculate the total number of cards as follows:

Total basketball cards = 6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 cards
Total baseball cards = 5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 cards

The total number of cards is the sum of basketball and baseball cards:
Total cards = 150 + 200 = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, so the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

Since each student received 10 cards, we can divide the remaining cards by 10 to find the number of students:
Number of students = 300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the difference in the amount paid by Becky and Kelly, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples each of them bought and subtract the discount from each total.

Becky's total cost = 20 apples * 0.45 = $9
Becky's discount = $1
Becky's amount paid = $9 - $1 = $8

Kelly's total cost = 20 apples * 0.50 = $10
Kelly's discount = 10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1
Kelly's amount paid = $10 - $1 = $9

The difference in the amount paid by Becky and Kelly = Kelly's amount paid - Becky's amount paid = $9 - $8 = $1

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we can utilize the concept of ratios. The given information states that each room has two sheets, one comforter, twice as many pillow cases as sheets, and twice as many towels as pillow cases.

Let's express the number of each item per room as a ratio:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforter: 1
- Pillow cases: 2 * 2 = 4
- Towels: 4 * 2 = 8

Now, we can express the total number of items per room as a sum of these ratios:
2 (sheets) + 1 (comforter) + 4 (pillow cases) + 8 (towels) = 15

To find the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we can multiply the total number of items per room by 80:
15 * 80 = 1200

Therefore, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200."

"To determine the number of pans Mary needs to bake, we can utilize the concept of division to allocate the total number of cupcakes required. 

Given that each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, the total number of cupcakes needed is:

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

To find out how many pans are required, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the capacity of each pan, which is 12 cupcakes.

48 cupcakes ÷ 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles."
"To determine the cost of the piece of paper, we can use the given information that it costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. Let's denote the cost of the pen as P and the cost of the paper as C. We know that P = $2.

The cost of the paper is $1 less than three times the price of the pen, so we can express this as C = 3P - 1.

Substituting P = $2 into the equation, we get C = 3(2) - 1 = 6 - 1 = $5.

The total cost of the items is the sum of the cost of the pen and the cost of the paper, which is P + C = $2 + $5 = $7.

Since Theo gave the cashier $10, the change she received is 10 - 7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To determine the number of pencils left, we can break down the problem into manageable steps. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of pencils initially. With 30 students and 10 pencils per student, the total number of pencils is 30 * 10 = 300.

Next, we calculate the number of pencils used in two months. Since 1/5 of the total pencils were used, we can express this as (1/5) * 300 = 60 pencils.

Now, we subtract the number of pencils used from the initial total to find the remaining pencils: 300 - 60 = 240.

Finally, we calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year, which is 1/3 of the remaining pencils. This can be expressed as (1/3) * 240 = 80 pencils.

Therefore, the number of pencils left is 80."
"To solve the given problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as x. According to the problem, the number of cookies he gets is half the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To isolate x, we can start by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the total number of students as x.

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x. We are also given that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, so the number of students without a desktop computer is x - (3/4)x = (1/4)x.

Equating the two expressions, we get:

(1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80."
"To determine the daily walking time, we can divide the total number of minutes (240) by the total number of days (21).

Let's perform the calculation:

240 minutes ÷ 21 days = 11.42857143 minutes per day

To express this as a more precise fraction, we can simplify the result:

240 ÷ 21 = 80/7

Now, we can convert the fraction to a decimal:

80 ÷ 7 = 11.42857143

Since we're dealing with a repeating decimal, we can express it as a mixed number or a decimal with a limited number of decimal places. In this case, we can approximate it to two decimal places:

11.43 minutes per day

Therefore, Jason needs to walk approximately 11.43 minutes per day for 4 days a week to break in his new shoes in 3 weeks.

"To determine the number of books each child received, we can employ a straightforward division operation. 

Given that Sarah spent $300 on books, with each book costing $15, we can calculate the total number of books as follows:

Total Cost / Cost per Book = Total Number of Books
$300 / $15 = 20 books

Since Sarah distributed an equal number of books among her 4 children, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find the number of books per child:

Total Number of Books ÷ Number of Children = Number of Books per Child
20 books ÷ 4 = 5 books

Therefore, each child received 5 books."
"To determine the number of kids in Gina's class who aren't allergic to anything, we can apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's denote the total number of kids as |U|, the number of kids allergic to dairy as |D|, the number of kids allergic to peanuts as |P|, and the number of kids allergic to both as |D ∩ P|.

We're given |D| = 9, |P| = 6, and |D ∩ P| = 3. To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we can use the formula:

|U| - |D ∪ P| = |U| - (|D| + |P| - |D ∩ P|

Substituting the given values, we get:

|U| - (|D| + |P| - |D ∩ P|) = 32 - (9 + 6 - 3) = 32 - 12 = 20

Therefore, 20 kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything.

"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to break down the costs into two components: the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets can be calculated by multiplying the cost per ticket ($5000) by the number of tickets (2). This results in a total cost of 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we can calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.20 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

Now, we can find the total cost of the trip by adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400"
"To determine the total number of paint tubes Jasper has, we can apply basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the number of blue paint tubes Ben has as B and the number of yellow paint tubes Ben has as Y. We are given that B = 4 and Y = 3.

Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, the number of blue paint tubes Jasper has can be calculated as B/2. Substituting the value of B, we get 4/2 = 2.

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so the number of yellow paint tubes Jasper has can be calculated as 3Y. Substituting the value of Y, we get 3*3 = 9.

To find the total number of paint tubes Jasper has, we add the number of blue and yellow paint tubes: 2 + 9 = 11.

"To determine the combined weight of the two pennies, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny by finding three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny.

The weight of the 1959 penny is given as 48 grains. To find three-quarters of this weight, we can multiply 48 by 3/4.

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding the weights of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny.

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."

"To determine the number of songs Luri can add to his player, we must first establish the number of songs he currently possesses. Given that Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we can calculate Luri's current song count as follows:

Luri's songs = 3 * Gabriel's songs
Luri's songs = 3 * 20
Luri's songs = 60

Next, we need to find out how many songs Gabriel can add to his player. The maximum capacity of his player is 100 songs, and he already has 20 songs. Therefore, the number of songs Gabriel can add is:

Gabriel's additional songs = Maximum capacity - Gabriel's current songs
Gabriel's additional songs = 100 - 20
Gabriel's additional songs = 80

Now, we can determine the difference in the number of songs Luri and Gabriel can add to their players:

Difference in additional songs = Gabriel's additional songs - Luri's songs
Difference in additional songs = 80 - 60
Difference in additional songs = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we can apply the concept of proportional reasoning. Since Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges, we can set up a proportion to find the amount of money he gave up.

Let's denote the total amount of money Stetson gave up as x. We know that he gave up $10 for each orange, and he ate 2/5 of the 60 oranges. So, we can set up the proportion:

(2/5) = (x / 10)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2 * 10 = 5x
20 = 5x

Now, we can divide both sides by 5:

x = 20 / 5
x = 4

However, this is the amount of money Stetson gave up per orange. Since he ate 2/5 of the oranges, we need to multiply this amount by 2/5:

x = (2/5) * 4
x = (2 * 4) / 5
x = 8 / 5
x = 1.6

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange, we can multiply the amount he gave up per orange by the total number of oranges he ate:

x = 1.6 * 10
x = 16

The final answer is: $16"
"To solve this problem, we can represent the cost of Jillian's shoes as 's' and the cost of her handbag as 'h'. We are given that the handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes. This relationship can be expressed as:

h = 3s - 20

We are also given that her shoes cost $80. We can substitute s = 80 into the equation:

h = 3(80) - 20
h = 240 - 20
h = 220

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To calculate the total hours James runs per week, we can employ the fundamental principles of unit conversion and multiplication.

First, we establish the number of miles James runs per day as the product of the miles per hour and the hours per day. Given that James runs 10 miles per hour, we can express this relationship as:

miles per hour × hours per day = miles per day
10 miles/hour × hours per day = 12 miles/day

To find the total hours per day, we can rearrange this equation to isolate hours per day:

hours per day = miles per day ÷ miles per hour
hours per day = 12 miles/day ÷ 10 miles/hour
hours per day = 1.2 hours/day

Now, we can multiply the hours per day by the number of days per week to determine the total hours per week:

total hours per week = hours per day × days per week
total hours per week = 1.2 hours/day × 5 days/week
total hours per week = 6 hours/week

Therefore, James runs a total of 6 hours per week."
"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs for his horses, we must first calculate the total daily consumption of oats. Since each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, the daily consumption per horse is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.

With four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds. To find the total consumption for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to convert the total amount of oats needed into the number of bags. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find the number of bags, we divide the total amount of oats needed by 50: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats for his horses for five days.

Final answer: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of girl Pomeranians, we can apply the concept of fractions to the given information. We know that two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and one-third of those Pomeranians are girls.

"To calculate the total cost of the pizzas, we can apply the principle of multiplication to determine the cost of the family-size pizza and then add it to the cost of the small pizza.

The family-size pizza costs three times as much as the small pizza, which is $8. Therefore, the cost of the family-size pizza can be calculated as:

Cost of family-size pizza = 3 * $8
Cost of family-size pizza = $24

Now, we can add the cost of the small pizza to the cost of the family-size pizza to find the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza
Total cost = $8 + $24
Total cost = $32

Therefore, Sally spends a total of $32 on the two pizzas."
"To calculate the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to consider the sale and coupon.

First, we'll calculate the discounted price of 2 packs of razors. Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Next, we'll subtract the $2.00 coupon from the cost of 1 pack: $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Now, we'll divide the discounted price by 4 to find the cost of each individual razor: $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

"To determine the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost for each guest), while the cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per guest).

We can equate the two costs and solve for 'x':

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides yields:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20:

x = 10

Therefore, the number of guests required for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of insects each person found. Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as x, the number David found as y, and the number Lily found as z.

We are given that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can express this as:

z = y + 7

We are also given that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can express this as:

y = x/2

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

x + y + z = 43

Substituting the expressions for y and z in terms of x, we get:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

y = x/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

z = y + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total yards of yarn used, we can add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma. 

First, we need to convert the fractions into equivalent decimals to facilitate the calculation. 

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, which is equivalent to 0.25. Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is equivalent to 0.5.

Total yards used = 0.25 + 0.5 = 0.75

Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, we can multiply the total yards used by 364 to find the total yards used in the skein.

Total yards used = 0.75 * 364 = 273

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used a total of 273 yards of yarn.

The final answer is: $\boxed{273}$"
"To calculate the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we can employ the principle of addition. We have two distinct groups of friends with different gift requirements.

First, we calculate the total number of gifts for the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each. This can be expressed as 2 × 5, which equals 10.

Next, we calculate the total number of gifts for the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each. This can be expressed as 3 × 2, which equals 6.

Now, we add these two totals together to find the overall number of gifts: 10 + 6 = 16.

Finally, we add the 10 additional random gifts to the previous total: 16 + 10 = 26.

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic expressions to represent the relationships between the dimensions of the chair, rug, and couch.

Let's denote the width of the chair as C, the width of the rug as R, and the length of the couch as L. We are given that the chair is 3 feet wide, so C = 3.

We are also given that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so R = C + 5. Substituting C = 3, we get R = 3 + 5 = 8.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug, so L = 2R + 2. Substituting R = 8, we get L = 2(8) + 2 = 18.

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we must first calculate the total amount spent on the grape and green apple gum. Since Suzie paid $2 for the grape gum and half as much for the green apple gum, the total cost for these two types of gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total amount Suzie paid, which is $7. This leaves us with the amount spent on the strawberry gum: $7 - $3 = $4.

Since Suzie purchased two packs of strawberry gum, we divide the total amount spent on strawberry gum by 2 to find the cost per pack: $4 ÷ 2 = $2.

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To optimize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to minimize the cost per stick while maximizing the number of sticks. This can be achieved by choosing the most cost-effective option.

The cost per stick for 2 x 4 lumber is $0.02, and for 2 x 8 lumber, it is $0.015. Since $0.015 is less than $0.02, we can conclude that 2 x 8 lumber is the most cost-effective option.

To determine the maximum number of sticks Frederick can make, we can divide the available budget by the cost per stick of 2 x 8 lumber:

Number of 2 x 8 lumber = $24 / $6 = 4

Since each 2 x 8 lumber yields 400 sticks, the total number of sticks is:

Total sticks = 4 x 400 = 1600 sticks

Therefore, Frederick can make 1600 popsicle sticks with the most cost-effective option.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1600}$"
"To calculate the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's 6 sled dogs, we can apply the fundamental principle of multiplication. Since each dog requires a pair of snowshoes, and the cost of each pair is $12.00, we can multiply the number of dogs by the cost per pair to determine the total cost.

The calculation is as follows:

Total Cost = Number of Dogs * Cost per Pair
Total Cost = 6 * $12.00
Total Cost = $72.00

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $72.00."
"To determine the weekly savings of Janet by purchasing a bus pass, we must first calculate the total weekly cost of her bus trips. 

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. This results in a total of 2 * 5 = 10 bus trips per week. Given that each bus trip costs $2.20, the total weekly cost is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20. The weekly savings can be calculated as $22 - $20 = $2.

Therefore, Janet would save $2 by purchasing a weekly bus pass.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the total number of animals in the farm and zoo, we need to analyze the given information and apply mathematical operations.

Let's start by identifying the number of cows and sheep in each location. The farm has 30 cows, and the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, which means the zoo has 30 * 2 = 60 cows.

Since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, we can calculate the number of sheep in the farm as 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of animals in each location by adding the number of cows and sheep:
Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

To find the combined total, we add the number of animals in the farm and zoo: 40 + 80 = 120 animals.

The total number of animals in the farm and zoo is 120."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios. Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as x and the number of potatoes as y. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, so we can set up the following equations:

x + y = number of onions Sophia bought
4x + 4y = number of onions and potatoes Rose bought

We are given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so we can substitute these values into the second equation:

4x + 4y = 12 + 4
4x + 4y = 16

Now, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 4:

x + y = 16/4
x + y = 4

We also know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, so we can set up another equation:

x = (1/4)(12)
x = 3

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into the first equation to find the value of y:

3 + y = 4
y = 1

Therefore, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to lose 30 pounds in approximately 7 months, we need to determine the total number of days available for weight loss.

From December 31st to July 19th, there are 183 days.

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, we can calculate the total calorie deficit required to lose 30 pounds:

Total calorie deficit = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

Now, we can calculate the daily calorie deficit needed:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calorie deficit / Number of days
= 105,000 calories / 183 days
≈ 576 calories/day

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 576 calories to reach his weight loss goal."
"To determine Gerald's remaining balance, we can apply the concept of daily earnings and total expenditure. 

Gerald's daily earnings are $30, and he worked for 7 days, resulting in a total of $30 * 7 = $210. 

However, he spent $100, so we need to subtract this amount from his total earnings to find his remaining balance. 

$210 - $100 = $110

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left.

The final answer is: $110"
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs, we can apply the fundamental principle of unit conversion and multiplication.

Given:
- Number of laps = 8
- Water needed per kilometer = 60 ml

First, we convert the distance from kilometers to kilometers, as the water requirement is given per kilometer. Since the distance per lap is already in kilometers, no conversion is necessary.

Next, we multiply the number of laps by the water requirement per kilometer to obtain the total amount of water needed.

Total water needed = Number of laps * Water needed per kilometer
Total water needed = 8 * 60
Total water needed = 480 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need 480 milliliters of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To calculate the amount of money Julie had left, we can break down the problem into two steps. First, we need to find 20% of the initial $500, which represents the amount spent on clothes. This can be calculated as:

0.20 * $500 = $100

Next, we subtract this amount from the initial $500 to find the remaining balance:

$500 - $100 = $400

Then, we calculate 25% of the remaining balance, which is the amount spent on CDs:

0.25 * $400 = $100

Finally, we subtract this amount from the remaining balance to find the final amount Julie had left:

$400 - $100 = $300

Therefore, Julie had $300 left.

300"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's represent the cost of the house as 'h' and the cost of the lot as 'l'. We are given that the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can express this relationship as:

h = 3l

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

h + l = 120,000

Substituting h = 3l into the second equation, we get:

3l + l = 120,000
4l = 120,000

Now, we can solve for 'l' by dividing both sides by 4:

l = 120,000 / 4
l = 30,000

Now that we have found the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting 'l' into the equation h = 3l:

h = 3(30,000)
h = 90,000

Therefore, the house costs $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To calculate the profit earned by Tara, we must first determine the total cost and total revenue.

The total cost is the product of the number of packs and the cost per pack: 
8 packs * $4 per pack = $32

The total revenue is the product of the number of bags and the selling price per bag:
8 bags * $8 per bag = $64

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $64 - $32
Profit = $32

Therefore, Tara earned a profit of $32."
"To calculate the total number of punches Joe threw, we can apply the fundamental principle of multiplication. Given that Joe throws 25 punches per minute and the fight consists of 5 rounds, each lasting 3 minutes, we can calculate the total number of punches as follows:

Total punches = (punches per minute) * (total minutes in the fight)
Total punches = 25 * 15
Total punches = 375

Therefore, Joe threw a total of 375 punches during the fight."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to establish a relationship between the number of cookies made by each individual. We know that Suzanne made 36 cookies, and Josh made one-fourth of that amount. 

First, let's calculate Josh's cookies:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. To find Kelsie's cookies, we can multiply Josh's cookies by 2:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"To calculate the total amount of money Ali has, we can add the values of the $10 bills and the $20 bills. 

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 x $10 = $40. 
Ali has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 x $20 = $120. 
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Since Ali gives his sister half of the total money, we can calculate this as $160 / 2 = $80.

Now, we need to find 3/5 of the remaining amount of money, which is 3/5 x $80 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

The final answer is 32."
"To solve this problem, we can represent the time it takes Rob to shingle a house as 'r' and the time it takes Royce as 'x'. We are given that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. This relationship can be expressed as:

x = 2r + 40

We are also given that Rob takes 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. We can substitute this value into the equation:

x = 2(120) + 40
x = 240 + 40
x = 280

Therefore, the time it takes Royce to shingle a house is 280 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"

Tony's rate is 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby's rate is 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy's rate is 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky's rate is 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour is 29."
"To determine the number of loaves of bread left, we must consider the total number of loaves initially baked, the number sold, and the number returned.

The bakery initially baked 200 loaves of bread. A total of 93 loaves were sold in the morning and 39 loaves were sold in the afternoon. To find the total number of loaves sold, we add the morning and afternoon sales: 93 + 39 = 132.

However, 6 loaves were returned. To find the number of loaves left, we subtract the total number sold from the initial number baked and then add the returned loaves: 200 - 132 + 6 = 74.

Therefore, the bakery had 74 loaves of bread left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{74}$"
"To determine the total number of rows, we can divide the total number of each color of tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

For red tulips: 36 ÷ 6 = 6 rows
For blue tulips: 24 ÷ 8 = 3 rows

Since the number of rows for each color is different, we need to find the smallest number of rows, which is 3 rows.

Therefore, Jackson will plant 3 rows of flowers in total."
"To determine the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of raisins by the amount of raisins required for one batch of oatmeal cookies.

We can set up a division problem: 27 ÷ (3/4). To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3.

Number of batches = 27 ÷ (3/4) = 27 × (4/3) = 36

Therefore, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies.

The final answer is: 36"
"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we must first calculate her original and new weekly consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) and then apply the unit conversion factor of $1.50 per kWh.

Original daily consumption: 12 kilowatts (kW) = 12 kW * 7 days = 84 kWh
New daily consumption: 12 kW + 2 kW = 14 kW = 14 kW * 7 days = 98 kWh

The difference in weekly consumption is 98 kWh - 84 kWh = 14 kWh.

Now, we can calculate the difference in weekly electric bills by multiplying the difference in consumption by the unit conversion factor of $1.50 per kWh.

Difference in weekly bill = 14 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $21

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $21."
"To solve this problem, we can apply the concept of inverse proportionality between the number of people and the time required to complete the task. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can establish a baseline rate of work.

Let's denote the rate at which one person paints as R. Then, the rate at which 5 people paint is 5R. Since the amount of work (painting a whole house) remains constant, we can set up a proportion:

1 person × 5 days = 5 people × x days

Simplifying the equation, we get:

5 = 5x

Dividing both sides by 5, we find:

x = 1 day

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total time required for 5 people to paint a whole house is:

1 day × 24 hours/day = 24 hours

Therefore, 5 people can paint a whole house in 24 hours.

Final answer: 24"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna's chair count can be expressed as 3x.

We are also given that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. This relationship can be represented by the equation:

20 = x - 2

Solving for x, we can add 2 to both sides of the equation:

x = 20 + 2
x = 22

Now that we have found the value of x, we can determine the number of chairs Ophelia has, which is 22. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna's chair count is 3 * 22 = 66.

The total number of sofas and chairs is the sum of the number of sofas and chairs they have:

Total = 20 (sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs)
Total = 20 + 22 + 66
Total = 108

The final answer is: $\boxed{108}$"
"To determine the number of additional CDs Tom could have purchased if he had not bought the headphone set, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of CDs as 'x'. The total cost of the CDs and the headphone set can be represented as:

Total Cost = Cost of CDs + Cost of Headphone Set
48 = 4x + 44

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 44 from both sides of the equation:

48 - 44 = 4x
4 = 4x

Next, we can divide both sides by 4 to isolate 'x':

x = 4/4
x = 1

However, this represents the number of CDs Tom could have bought if he had spent the entire $44 on CDs. To find the number of additional CDs he could have bought, we need to subtract 1 from the result, since he would have already bought 1 CD with the $44:

Additional CDs = x - 1
Additional CDs = 1 - 1
Additional CDs = 0

Therefore, Tom could not have bought any additional CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

The correct answer is: A) 0"
"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks, we can break down the problem into parts. 

Let's denote the number of weeks Josh worked 4 hours as 'x'. Since he worked 5 hours for two consecutive weeks, we can represent this as 2 * 5. Additionally, he worked 6 hours in one week. The total number of hours can be expressed as:

4x + 2 * 5 + 6

We know that the total number of weeks is 8, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 10 + 6 = 8 * 4

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x + 16 = 32

Subtracting 16 from both sides:

4x = 16

Dividing both sides by 4:

x = 4

Now that we know x, we can find the total number of hours:

4 * 4 + 2 * 5 + 6
= 16 + 10 + 6
= 32

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 32.

The final answer is 32."
"To determine the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, resulting in 48 - 8 = 40 passengers. Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers now is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which is 3 times the number who got off (21), so 3 * 21 = 63. Therefore, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 + 63 = 122.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote Jame's current age as x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 8 years old, which is x + 13 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. This can be expressed as:

x + 13 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 13 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

13 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

8 = x

So, Jame's current age is 8 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 13 years old, which is 8 + 13 = 21 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 21 - 8 = 13 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the cost of one monitor, we can utilize the given information to form a system of linear equations. Let's denote the cost of the computer as C, the cost of the printer as P, and the cost of one monitor as M.

We are given that the total cost of the computer, monitors, and printer is $2,400, so we can write the equation:

C + 2M + P = 2,400

We are also given that the computer costs $1,100, so C = 1,100. Additionally, we know that the printer costs $400 less than the computer, so P = C - 400.

Substituting the value of C into the equation for P, we get:

1,100 + 2M + (1,100 - 400) = 2,400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

1,100 + 2M + 700 = 2,400

Combine like terms:

1,800 + 2M = 2,400

Subtract 1,800 from both sides:

2M = 600

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the number of seashells brought by the boys and the relationship between the number of seashells brought by the girls and the boys.

Let's denote the number of seashells brought by each boy as B and the number of seashells brought by each girl as G. We know that there are 20 kids in total, so the number of boys and girls must be equal, i.e., 10 boys and 10 girls.

We are given that the boys brought 60 seashells each, so the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10B = 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be expressed as G = 60 + 4B.

Since we know that G = 60 + 4B, we can substitute the value of B into this equation. We know that B = 60, so G = 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300.

Therefore, the number of seashells brought by each girl is G = 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of candies Nick had initially as 'N' and the number of candies George had initially as 'G'. We know that Nick had twice as many candies as George, so we can write the equation:

N = 2G

We also know that George ate 5 candies, leaving him with 3 candies. Therefore, we can write another equation:

G - 5 = 3

Solving for G, we get:

G = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find Nick's initial amount:

N = 2G
N = 2(8)
N = 16

Therefore, Nick had 16 candies initially.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine Anne's age, we can apply the concept of relative age differences. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Chenny's age is given as 10 years.
2. Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so we subtract 4 from Chenny's age to find Alyana's age: 10 - 4 = 6 years.
3. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so we add 2 to Alyana's age to find Anne's age: 6 + 2 = 8 years.

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old.

Final answer: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total thickness of the four books, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To determine the number of vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we can utilize the concept of subtraction. 

Let's calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made: 18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week) = 54 vlogs.

To find the number of vlogs she still needs to make, we subtract the total vlogs made from the target: 72 (target) - 54 (total made) = 18 vlogs.

Therefore, Emma needs to create 18 more vlogs to meet her monthly goal of 72 vlogs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To calculate the total amount paid, we need to determine the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. 

The tip can be calculated by multiplying the bill amount by 0.20, which is equivalent to 20/100 or 1/5. 

$50 * (1/5) = $10

Now, add the tip to the original bill: 
$50 + $10 = $60

Therefore, the total amount paid is $60."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

Let's denote the initial amount each boy received as x. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we can set up the equation:

x + x + x = 18
3x = 18
x = 18 / 3
x = 6

The eldest boy's initial share is $6. He then adds $5 to his share, making his total $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10 to his share, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13. To triple this amount, we multiply $13 by 3:

$13 × 3 = $39

Therefore, the eldest boy now has $39."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount Elvis saves per day in the first half of the month as x. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, the amount saved in the second half is 2x.

We know that the total amount saved in the first half of the month is equal to the total amount saved in the second half of the month, as both halves together make up the total monthly target of $1125. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x * 15 = 2x * 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = $562.50

However, this equation is not entirely accurate, as it assumes that the first half of the month has 15 days. Since April has 30 days, we can set up a more accurate equation:

x * (15 + 15) = 1125

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x * 30 = 1125

Dividing both sides by 30, we get:

x = 1125 / 30

x = 37.5

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, the amount saved in the second half is 2x:

2x = 2 * 37.5

2x = 75

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $75 per day in the second half of the month.

The final answer is: $75"
"To calculate the total cost of the fruit, we can apply the principles of arithmetic to determine the sum of the individual costs.

The cost of apples is $1.50 each, and Verna purchased 3 apples, so the total cost of apples is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50.

The cost of oranges is $0.80 each, and Verna purchased 5 oranges, so the total cost of oranges is 5 * $0.80 = $4.00.

The cost of peaches is $0.75 each, and Verna purchased 6 peaches, so the total cost of peaches is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

To find the total cost of the fruit, we add the individual costs together: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Since Verna gave $20, we can calculate the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount given: $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To calculate the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny, we can apply the concept of linear equations. Let's denote Jairus's earnings as J and Jenny's earnings as Y. We know that Jairus earns $0.8 per task and Jenny earns $0.5 per task. Since they both completed 20 tasks, we can set up the following equation:

J = 0.8 * 20
Y = 0.5 * 20

Simplifying the equations, we get:

J = 16
Y = 10

To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

J - Y = 16 - 10
J - Y = 6

Therefore, Jairus earns $6 more than Jenny.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a fundamental concept in algebra: the distributive property. Let's denote the amount of money Brad receives as x. Since Jeff receives four times as much as Brad, we can express Jeff's share as 4x.

The total amount of money, 100 dollars, is the sum of the amounts received by Jeff and Brad. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 100

To isolate x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 100/5

x = 20

Now that we have found the value of x, we can determine Jeff's share by multiplying x by 4:

Jeff's share = 4x
= 4(20)
= 80

Therefore, Jeff receives 80 dollars.

The final answer is: 80"
"To calculate the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we can utilize the concept of daily commutes and the number of working days. 

Given that Jeff's work is 3 miles away and he walks to and from work each day, the total distance covered in a day is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles. 

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week can be calculated as:

Total miles/week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

Therefore, Jeff walks a total of 30 miles in a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we can break down the process into three distinct steps:

1. Initial alphabet writing: 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters
2. Writing half of the alphabet: 26 letters / 2 = 13 letters
3. Re-writing the entire previous content: 52 letters + 13 letters = 65 letters

To calculate the total number of letters written, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: 

Total = (n * (a1 + an)) / 2

where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, n = 3 (three steps), a1 = 52, and an = 65. 

Total = (3 * (52 + 65)) / 2
Total = (3 * 117) / 2
Total = 351 / 2
Total = 175.5

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a letter, we can round down to the nearest whole number. 

Total = 175

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"This problem can be modeled as a geometric sequence, where the first term (a) is 3 and the common ratio (r) is 3. The formula to find the nth term of a geometric sequence is given by: an = a * r^(n-1).

To find the total number of families notified in the fourth round, we need to find the 4th term of the sequence. Plugging in the values, we get:

a4 = 3 * 3^(4-1)
a4 = 3 * 3^3
a4 = 3 * 27
a4 = 81

Therefore, the total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81."
"To determine Mark's initial weight, we can utilize the concept of linear decline. Given that Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, we can calculate his initial weight by adding the total weight lost to his final weight.

Let's denote Mark's initial weight as 'x'. The equation representing the situation is:

x - 10 * 3 = 70

Simplifying the equation:

x - 30 = 70

Adding 30 to both sides:

x = 100

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"To determine the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as 'x'. According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

We can set up the equation as follows:

x + 2 = 5 * 80

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 2 = 400

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:

x = 398

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{398}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to apply the 10% discount to the total cost of all the items.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

The cost of 5 notebooks = 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 2 pens = 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator = $12
The cost of 1 geometry set = $10

Total cost of all items = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Now, we need to apply the 10% discount. To do this, we'll calculate 10% of the total cost and subtract it from the total cost.

10% of $30 = 0.10 * $30 = $3
Discount amount = $3
Total cost after discount = $30 - $3 = $27

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

The final answer is: $27"
"To calculate the total cost of Carly's order, we can apply the principles of arithmetic to determine the sum of the individual costs.

First, we multiply the number of hamburgers by the cost per hamburger: 5 × $4 = $20.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the potato fries by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack: 10 × $0.30 = $3.

Then, we find the total cost of the fruit drinks by multiplying the number of cans by the cost per can: 5 × $2 = $10.

Now, we add the individual costs together to find the total cost: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

To determine the change Carly receives, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill: $50 - $33 = $17.

Therefore, Carly gets $17 back as change.

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000.

First, let's calculate the commission for sales up to $1000. The commission rate is 30% of the sales amount. To find 30% of $1000, we multiply $1000 by 0.30.

Commission for sales up to $1000 = $1000 * 0.30 = $300

Next, we need to calculate the additional commission for sales over $1000. The sales amount over $1000 is $1500. The additional commission rate is 10% of the sales amount over $1000. To find 10% of $1500, we multiply $1500 by 0.10.

Additional commission for sales over $1000 = $1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, we add the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000 to find the total commission earned by Antonella.

Total commission earned by Antonella = $300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to purchase, we must first calculate the total number of bottles required for his guests. With 70 guests and 2 bottles per guest, the total number of bottles needed is 70 x 2 = 140.

Since Bill already possesses 48 bottles, we can find the number of additional bottles required by subtracting the number of bottles he has from the total number of bottles needed: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to acquire 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{92}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold and a hot day.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes him to swim 3 miles, we can multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3:
Time (cold day) = 3 × 16 = 48 minutes

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. So, we first find the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day:
Time (hot day) = 2 × 16 + 2 = 34 minutes
Time (hot day) = 32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3:
Time (hot day) = 3 × 34 = 102 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day:
Difference = Time (hot day) - Time (cold day) = 102 - 48 = 54 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take John to save $80, we can use the formula:

Weekly earnings = Hourly wage * Hours worked per day * Days worked per week
Weekly earnings = $2/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 days/week
Weekly earnings = $40/week

Now, we can divide the amount John wants to save ($80) by his weekly earnings ($40) to find the number of weeks:

Number of weeks = Amount to save / Weekly earnings
Number of weeks = $80 / $40
Number of weeks = 2

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

Final answer: 2"
"To calculate the total cost of the lunch, we need to determine the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. Since it's mentioned that the cost is thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub, we can calculate it as follows:

Cost of foot-long fish sub: $40
Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub: 3 * $40 = $120

Now, let's add the cost of both subs to find the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of foot-long fish sub + Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub
Total cost = $40 + $120
Total cost = $160

Therefore, the total cost for lunch is $160."
"To determine the total number of holes in the bag of buttons, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the number of holes in each category of buttons and then summing the results.

First, we identify the number of buttons with two holes, which is given as 7. The number of holes in these buttons can be calculated as 7 * 2 = 14.

Next, we determine the number of buttons with four holes. Since there are a total of 21 buttons in the bag, and 7 have two holes, the remaining buttons are 21 - 7 = 14. Therefore, the number of buttons with four holes is 14.

Now, we calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with four holes by multiplying the number of buttons by the number of holes per button: 14 * 4 = 56.

Finally, we add the total number of holes in both categories to obtain the overall total: 14 + 56 = 70.

Therefore, the total number of holes in the bag of buttons is 70."
"To determine the size of Peter's locker, we can apply the concept of proportional relationships between the lockers. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can express this relationship as a fraction.

Let's denote the size of Peter's locker as P and the size of Zack's locker as Z. We know that Z = 2P (since Peter's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, and Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, so Zack's locker is 24/2 = 12 cubic inches).

Now, we can set up the proportion: P = (1/4)Z

Substituting the value of Z, we get: P = (1/4)(12)

To simplify, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 4: P = 12/4

Finally, we can simplify the fraction: P = 3

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake, we must first establish the amount he currently consumes. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, and the daily recommendation is 4 cups, Octavia's daily consumption is 0.5 * 4 = 2 cups. 

Given that Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, his current consumption is 2 * 10 = 20 cups.

The doctor has asked Juan to reduce his intake to 4 cups. To find the reduction, we subtract the recommended amount from his current consumption: 20 - 4 = 16.

Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we can employ the principle of addition. 

We have 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, and 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each. 

Let's calculate the total number of hamsters: 3 * 10 = 30

Next, let's calculate the total number of guinea pigs: 3 * 5 = 15

Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs: 30 + 15 = 45

Therefore, the pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we can utilize the formula for calculating the mean:

Mean = (Sum of weights) / Number of individuals

Given Mark's weight is 150 pounds, Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. Since Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, Bob's weight is 2 x 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the sum of their weights:

Sum of weights = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
= 150 + 130 + 260
= 540

The number of individuals is 3. Therefore, the average weight is:

Mean = (Sum of weights) / Number of individuals
= 540 / 3
= 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To determine the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we can utilize the concept of relative motion and the tangent function. 

Let's denote the initial angle as θ1 = 32 degrees, the hourly rate of change as dθ = 5 degrees/hour, and the time elapsed as t = 10 hours. We can calculate the final angle θ2 using the formula:

θ2 = θ1 + dθ * t
θ2 = 32 + 5 * 10
θ2 = 32 + 50
θ2 = 82 degrees

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine the total cost of the birthday candles, we need to calculate the number of packs required and then multiply it by the cost per pack.

Let's break it down:

The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, so the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. Since James has two sons, he needs 2 candles for the 12-year-old and 2 candles for the 8-year-old, making a total of 4 candles.

To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by 5 (since each pack contains 5 candles):

4 candles ÷ 5 candles/pack = 0.8 packs

Since James can't buy a fraction of a pack, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, he will need to buy 1 pack of 5 candles.

The cost of 1 pack of 5 candles is $3.

Therefore, James will spend $3 on birthday candles.

The final answer is: $3"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the pages read in the first week and then adding the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the pages read in the first week. We know Judy read for 15 minutes each night, which is equivalent to 15/1.5 = 10 units of 2 pages. Since there are 7 nights in a week, the total number of pages read in the first week is 10 * 7 = 70 pages.

Next, we are given that Judy read a total of 100 pages in the second week.

To find the total number of pages read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week and the second week: 70 + 100 = 170 pages.

The final answer is: $\boxed{170}$"
"To determine the number of sandwiches left, we can calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor.

Cody ate 1/3 of 12 sandwiches, which can be expressed as (1/3) × 12 = 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate 1/4 of 12 sandwiches, which can be expressed as (1/4) × 12 = 3 sandwiches.

The total number of sandwiches eaten is the sum of the sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor, which is 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the initial number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches.

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is 5."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

We are given that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, which can be expressed as:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3N + 21

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into three distinct parts based on the tooth fairy's payment structure.

Let's denote the amount of money the tooth fairy gave for the first tooth as $5.00. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 each, resulting in a total of 3 * $1.00 = $3.00. 

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon:
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of goals scored by each teenager. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, the number of goals scored by Anna as A, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

We are given that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, which can be expressed as:

R = M + 20

We are also given that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, which can be expressed as:

R = A + 45

Since we know Richie scored 80 goals, we can substitute R = 80 into the first equation:

80 = M + 20

Solving for M, we get:

M = 80 - 20
M = 60

Now that we have the value of M, we can substitute it into the second equation to find A:

80 = A + 45

Solving for A, we get:

A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we have the values of M and A, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:

Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Mitchell and Liam, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

We know that Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each, so we can calculate his total earnings as follows:

Total earnings = Number of lemonades sold × Price per lemonade
Total earnings = 21 × $4
Total earnings = $84

In contrast, Liam's earnings are given as $63. To find the difference, we subtract his earnings from Mitchell's earnings:

Difference = Total earnings of Mitchell - Total earnings of Liam
Difference = $84 - $63
Difference = $21

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the total amount spent on wooden and plastic action figures separately.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday. Since Peter spent $5 each day for 3 days, the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:

$5 * 3 = $15

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount Peter has after spending $15 on wooden action figures:

$70 - $15 = $55

Since Peter will buy plastic action figures for the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), we can calculate the number of plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $55:

$55 ÷ $2 = 27.5

Since Peter can't buy half a figure, he will buy 27 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 3 wooden action figures and 27 plastic action figures.

The final answer is 30."
"To calculate the total cost, we can break down the expenses into distinct components and apply basic arithmetic operations.

The cost of spaying the kitten is a one-time expense of $200. The cost of the three vaccines can be calculated by multiplying the cost of a single vaccine ($20) by the number of vaccines (3), resulting in $60. Additionally, the cost of the broken vases can be determined by multiplying the cost of a single vase ($12) by the number of vases (4), yielding $48.

To find the total cost, we can add these amounts together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

Therefore, the total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops in a month and compare it to the total number of roses he grows.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses supplied to the shops in a month. The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, the second flower shop orders 15 roses per week, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. We can calculate the total number of roses supplied by multiplying the number of roses each shop orders per week by 4 (since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month).

Total roses supplied = (20 roses/week * 4 weeks) + (15 roses/week * 4 weeks) + (30 roses/week * 4 weeks)
Total roses supplied = 80 roses + 60 roses + 120 roses
Total roses supplied = 260 roses

Next, we need to calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month. Since Ford grows 40 roses per week, we can multiply the number of roses he grows per week by 4 (since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month).

Total roses grown = 40 roses/week * 4 weeks
Total roses grown = 160 roses

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total roses grown from the total roses supplied:

Roses lacking = Total roses supplied - Total roses grown
Roses lacking = 260 roses - 160 roses
Roses lacking = 100 roses

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To calculate the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we can utilize the concept of uniform monthly depreciation. 

The initial amount in the account is $3000, and the monthly depreciation is $100. To find the remaining amount after 24 months, we can apply the formula for uniform depreciation:

Remaining Amount = Initial Amount - (Monthly Depreciation * Number of Months)
= $3000 - ($100 * 24)
= $3000 - $2400
= $600

Therefore, the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years is $600."
"To calculate the net profit of the food truck, we need to consider the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue is calculated by multiplying the number of sandwiches sold by the price per sandwich. In this case, the food truck sold 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each.

Total Revenue = Number of Sandwiches Sold * Price per Sandwich
Total Revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total Revenue = $70.00

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments. The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.

Cost of Bread = Cost per Loaf * Number of Loaves
Cost of Bread = $3.00 * 1
Cost of Bread = $3.00

The cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 for every 10 sandwiches.

Cost of Cheese and Condiments = $30.00

Total Cost = Cost of Bread + Cost of Cheese and Condiments
Total Cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total Cost = $33.00

Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Net Profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net Profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37."
"To determine the total number of muffin crayons Kate can make, we must first calculate the total number of crayons she has. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we can express this as a multiplication problem:

3 × 64 = 192

Now, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8, as Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin. This can be represented as:

192 ÷ 8 = 24

To find the total amount of money Kate can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin:

24 × $1.50 = $36

"To calculate the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to consider the costs associated with the carpet, padding, and installation. 

First, we calculate the area of the room: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of the installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of the installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of the installation: $2592 + $432 + $7344 = $9608.

Therefore, the total cost to replace the carpet is $9608."
"To calculate the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we must first sum the total number of birds observed over the 7-day period. This can be achieved by adding the individual daily counts.

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90
= 280

To determine the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days, which is 7.

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / 7
= 280 / 7
= 40

Therefore, Mack saw an average of 40 birds per day."
"To find the final value of the number train, we can break down the problem into steps and apply algebraic manipulations.

Let's denote the starting value as x. The problem states that the starting value plus half the number was divided by 5, and the resulting value was then multiplied by the starting value minus 12. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

((x + (x/2)) / 5) * (x - 12)

To simplify this expression, we can follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Calculate half of x: x/2
2. Add x to the result: x + x/2
3. Divide the result by 5: (x + x/2) / 5
4. Multiply the result by x - 12

Let's simplify each step:

(x + x/2) / 5 = (2x/2 + x/2) / 5 = (3x/2) / 5 = 3x/10

Now, multiply the result by x - 12:

(3x/10) * (x - 12) = 3x^2/10 - 36x/10

The final value of the number train is 3x^2/10 - 36x/10.

Given that the starting value is 20, we can substitute x = 20 into the expression:

3(20)^2/10 - 36(20)/10
= 3(400)/10 - 720/10
= 1200/10 - 720/10
= 480/10
= 48

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To determine the total number of cards, we can utilize the principle of addition. Given that the boy has 5 cards and his brother has 3 fewer cards, we can express this as an algebraic equation:

Let B = number of cards the boy has
Let B - 3 = number of cards the brother has

We are given that B = 5. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

B - 3 = 5 - 3
B - 3 = 2

Now, we can solve for B - 3, which represents the number of cards the brother has. However, we are interested in the total number of cards they have together. To find this, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards the brother has:

Total number of cards = B + (B - 3)
= 5 + 2
= 7

Therefore, the total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To determine the correct temperature setting for Maggie's oven, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The oven is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees off. 
To find the percentage, we divide the error by the original temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find 4% of 520. 
4% of 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

To find the correct temperature setting, we add the error to the original temperature: 
520 + 20.8 = 540.8

Therefore, Maggie should set the oven to 540.8 degrees.

Final answer: $\boxed{540.8}$"
"To calculate the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we can utilize the concept of adding fractions with unlike denominators. 

First, we convert both times to minutes: 1 hour and 30 minutes is equivalent to 90 minutes, and 2 hours and 5 minutes is equivalent to 125 minutes.

Now, we add the two times together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

Final answer: $\boxed{215}$"
"To calculate the combined value of the two houses, we need to find 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value. This can be achieved using the formula:

Combined value = Herb's house value - (Herb's house value x 0.30)

Plugging in the given values, we get:

Combined value = $76,000 - ($76,000 x 0.30)
= $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

Alternatively, we can express this calculation as:

Combined value = 76,000 - 0.30(76,000)
= 76,000 - 22,800
= 53,200

Therefore, the combined value of the two houses is $53,200."
"To determine the total number of utensils, we must first calculate the number of cups and dishes each individual brought.

Judy initially purchased a dozen cups, which is equivalent to 12 cups. Since she brought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.
The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To calculate the cost of each pair of contacts, we can use the following steps:

First, we need to find the discounted price of 2 boxes of contacts. The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. To find the discounted price, we can calculate 10% of $100.00 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $100.00 is $10.00. So, the discounted price of 1 box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 x $90.00 = $180.00.

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes will contain 2 x 90 = 180 pairs.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs: $180.00 ÷ 180 pairs = $1.00 per pair.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To calculate the earnings of Tabitha's helpers, we need to break down their individual work hours and rates.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. Given her hourly rate of $10, her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Therefore, John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. With an hourly rate of $10, his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To determine the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total calories burned during her activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. 

Total calories burned = (2 hours * 500 calories/hour) + (1 hour * 600 calories/hour) 
Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 
Total calories burned = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water.

Total water needed = Total calories burned / 200 
Total water needed = 1600 / 200 
Total water needed = 8 

Therefore, Hannah needs 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{800}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of red, blue, and green jelly beans. Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:

R = 0.99B

Additionally, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:

G = 1.01B

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

2B + 0.99B = 4500

Combine the B terms:

2.99B = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99:

B = 1500

Now that we have found the value of B, we can find the values of R and G:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To calculate the average of the three measurements, we can use the formula for the arithmetic mean:

Average = (Sum of all values) / Number of values

In this case, the sum of the three measurements is 47 + 52 + 57 = 156. 

Now, we divide the sum by 3 to find the average:

Average = 156 / 3

Average = 52

Therefore, the average of the three measurements is 52."
"To determine the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we can calculate the total weight change over the 5-week period.

Let's break it down:

Weight change per week for Cheerios: -1.25 pounds/week
Weight change per week for donuts: +1.75 pounds/week

Total weight change for 5 weeks for Cheerios: -1.25 * 5 = -6.25 pounds
Total weight change for 5 weeks for donuts: +1.75 * 5 = +8.75 pounds

The difference in weight between the two options is the total weight change for donuts minus the total weight change for Cheerios: 8.75 - (-6.25) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we can employ a systematic approach. Let's break down the problem into manageable components.

First, we'll calculate the number of people invited by Alex. We know she initially invited 100 people. Then, each of these 100 people invited 2 friends, resulting in an additional 200 people. Additionally, Alex directly invited 10 friends, and 8 of them brought their spouses, contributing 16 more people.

Now, we can express this as an equation: Total = Initial Invitations + (Initial Invitations * 2) + Direct Invitations + (Direct Invitations * 2)

Total = 100 + (100 * 2) + 10 + (10 * 2)
Total = 100 + 200 + 10 + 20
Total = 330

Therefore, Alex will need 330 seats for the event.

The final answer is: $\boxed{330}$"
"To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we can follow the given information step by step.

First, we know the weight of the Affenpinscher is 10 pounds. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund's weight is 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

Next, the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, which is 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

Finally, the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff's weight is 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds."
"To determine the cost difference between Amazon and eBay, we must calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the total cost is $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping, since it costs twice as much as on Amazon) = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final answer is: $1"
"The exponential growth of the beanstalk can be modeled using the formula for exponential growth: N(t) = N0 * 2^t, where N0 is the initial height (4 feet) and t is the number of days.

To find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window (20 feet), we need to solve for t when N(t) > 20.

N(t) = 4 * 2^t
20 < 4 * 2^t

Divide both sides by 4:
5 < 2^t

Take the logarithm base 2 of both sides:
log2(5) < t

Using a calculator, we get:
2.32 < t

Since t must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a day), the smallest integer value of t that satisfies the inequality is 3.

Therefore, it will take at least 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total grams of protein John gets per week, we can utilize the concept of unit conversion and multiplication. 

First, we need to establish the daily protein intake from the given information. Since John consumes 200 grams of mushrooms daily, and each cup contains 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the daily protein intake as follows:

Daily protein intake = (200 grams / 100 grams per cup) * 3 grams per cup
Daily protein intake = 2 cups * 3 grams per cup
Daily protein intake = 6 grams per day

To find the weekly protein intake, we multiply the daily amount by 7:

Weekly protein intake = 6 grams per day * 7 days per week
Weekly protein intake = 42 grams per week

Therefore, John's weekly protein intake is 42 grams."
"To solve this problem, we can utilize the concept of linear equations and algebraic manipulation. Let's represent Jerry's current age as 'x'. The given information states that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be translated into the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides yields:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides results in:

10 = x

Therefore, Jerry's current age is 10.

To determine Jerry's age in 3 years, we can add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Thus, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the total cost of the dental work, we can break down the expenses into two components: the base price of the implants and the additional cost of the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find out how many hours George needs to work to cover this amount, we can divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage of $15.

Let's calculate the number of hours George needs to work:

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

Therefore, George needs to work for 260 hours to cover the remaining amount.

The final answer is: 260"
"In a triangle, the sum of the interior angles is a fundamental property that can be expressed as:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

where x represents the measure of the smallest angle. Combining like terms, we obtain:

6x = 180

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 6:

x = 180/6
x = 30

Now that we have found the value of x, we can determine the measures of the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60
3x = 3(30) = 90

Therefore, the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the total number of gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and then divide it by the cost of a single gumball.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has:

8 quarters = 8 x $0.25 = $2.00
6 dimes = 6 x $0.10 = $0.60
14 nickels = 14 x $0.05 = $0.70
15 pennies = 15 x $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy:

$3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"The total number of legs in the store can be calculated by multiplying the number of each type of pet by the number of legs it has, and then adding the results together.

Let's break it down:

- Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
- Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
- Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To calculate the weight Jamaal now uses, we need to find 50% of the original weight and add it to the original weight. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

The new weight is the original weight plus 50% of the original weight: 8 + 4 = 12 pounds

Since Jamaal uses a weight two pounds lighter than that, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds: 12 - 2 = 10 pounds

Therefore, the weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we can break down the problem into three parts: the number of games he receives as gifts, the number of games he buys each year, and the total number of games he buys over the three years.

Let's denote the number of games Steve buys per year as 'x'. We know that he buys 1 game per month, so the total number of games he buys per year is 12x.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of games Steve has after 3 years:

Total games = (5 + 12x) + (5 + 12x) + (5 + 24x)

Combine like terms:

Total games = 15 + 48x

Since Steve gets 5 games for Christmas every year, we need to add 15 to the total number of games he buys over the three years:

Total games = 15 + 48x + 15

Combine like terms:

Total games = 30 + 48x

Now, we need to find the value of x. We know that Steve buys 1 game per month for the first year, 2 games per month for the second year, and 4 games per month for the third year. Let's set up an equation to represent the total number of games he buys over the three years:

1(12) + 2(12) + 4(12) = 48x

Simplify the equation:

12 + 24 + 48 = 48x

Combine like terms:

84 = 48x

Divide both sides by 48:

x = 84/48

x = 7/4

x = 1.75

Now that we know the value of x, we can substitute it into the equation for the total number of games:

Total games = 30 + 48(1.75)

Total games = 30 + 84

Total games = 114

The final answer is: 114"
"To determine the additional time required to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we can utilize the concept of unit rates. 

First, we establish the rate at which the plane travels: 1200 miles per 3 hours. This can be simplified to 400 miles per hour.

Now, we can calculate the additional time needed to cover 2000 miles at this rate:

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To calculate the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours, we need to determine their individual hourly production rates and then multiply those rates by the total number of hours worked.

Ruiz's production rate is 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour. 

Marissa's production rate is 3/4 times Ruiz's rate, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours:
Ruiz's total production in 12 hours = 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds.
Marissa's total production in 12 hours = 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"
"To determine the amount of money Howard has left, we can calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from his original amount.

Let's break down his spending:

On Monday, he spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 x $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 x $16 = $64.

Total amount spent = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88

Original amount = $100

Amount left = Original amount - Total amount spent
= $100 - $88
= $12

Therefore, Howard has $12 left."
"To calculate the total earnings from selling lemonade, we can break down the problem into two periods: the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours.

For the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. This can be represented as:

15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour

To find the total earnings for the first 4 hours, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours:

$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup. This can be represented as:

10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour

To find the total earnings for the next 2 hours, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours:

$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Now, we add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:

$30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the number of years a tire will last, we must first calculate the total number of rotations it can undergo. Given that each tire can rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations per mile as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations/mile

Now, we can multiply this value by the total miles driven per year to find the total rotations per year:

362.5 rotations/mile * 4800 miles/year = 1,745,000 rotations/year

Finally, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the total rotations per year to find the number of years it will last:

10,440,000 rotations / 1,745,000 rotations/year = 6 years

Therefore, the tire will last for approximately 6 years before it needs to be replaced.

Final answer: 6"
"To determine the cost of each pump, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. 

Given that 2 pumps yield 120 washings, we can calculate the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of 120 washings ($24.00) by the number of washings obtained from 1 pump (60). 

Cost per pump = Total cost / Number of washings per pump
= $24.00 / 60
= $0.40

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

Cost per pump (in cents) = $0.40 * 100
= 40 cents

Therefore, each pump costs 40 cents.

The final answer is 40."
"To calculate the total cost of the outfit, we need to first determine the discount on the shirt. The discount is 30% of the original price of $25. 

The discount amount is $25 * 0.3 = $7.50.

The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

The total cost of the outfit is the sum of the discounted shirt and the shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Since sales tax is included, we'll apply an 8% sales tax rate to the total cost. The sales tax amount is $52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20.

The total cost of the outfit with sales tax is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70.

To find out how much money Joe will have left, we subtract the total cost from his initial $50: $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70.

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, this indicates that he won't have enough money to buy the outfit."
"To determine the total amount of butter needed, we can utilize the concept of unit conversion and multiplication. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we can express this as a ratio: 1 dozen : 1/4 pound. To find the amount of butter required for 4 dozen croissants, we can multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

4 dozen croissants * (1/4 pound / 1 dozen) = 4 * (1/4) = 1 pound per day

As Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days, we can multiply the daily amount by 7:

1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the cost difference between repaving Monica's and Lewis' streets, we can calculate the cost of repaving each street separately and then find the difference.

The cost per meter is $194, and Monica's street is 150 meters long. To find the total cost of repaving her street, we multiply the cost per meter by the length of her street:

Cost for Monica's street = $194 × 150
= $29,100

Lewis' street is 490 meters long. To find the total cost of repaving his street, we multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street:

Cost for Lewis' street = $194 × 490
= $95,060

The difference in cost between repaving Lewis' street and Monica's street is:

Difference in cost = Cost for Lewis' street - Cost for Monica's street
= $95,060 - $29,100
= $65,960

Therefore, repaving Lewis' street costs $65,960 more than repaving Monica's street."
"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we can break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:

$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This is a classic example of a geometric progression (GP) with a common ratio of 1.5. The formula for the sum of a GP is:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = $150,000 (the first term), r = 1.5, and n = 5. Plugging in these values, we get:

S = $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^5) / (1 - 1.5)
S = $150,000 * (1 - 7.59375) / (-0.5)
S = $150,000 * (-6.59375) / (-0.5)
S = $150,000 * 13.1875
S = $1,977,500

Now, we add the cost of the first 5 months and the cost of the remaining 5 months:
$500,000 + $1,977,500 = $2,477,500

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is $2,477,500."
"To calculate the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to consider the ounces of meat each player ate and add them together.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

Since the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To calculate the total number of posts in March, we can utilize the fundamental principles of arithmetic. Given that each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, we can multiply the daily posting rate by the total number of days in March.

Total number of posts in March = Daily posting rate * Total number of days in March
Total number of posts in March = 3 * 31
Total number of posts in March = 93

Therefore, the total number of posts in March will be 93."
"To calculate the total cost of water for laundry in a year, we can employ the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

First, we need to determine the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year. Since he does laundry twice a week, we can calculate this as 52 weeks * 2 loads/week = 104 loads/year.

Next, we multiply the total number of loads by the amount of water used per load, which is 20 gallons. This yields 104 loads/year * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons/year.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of water for laundry in a year by multiplying the total gallons used by the cost per gallon, which is $0.15. This results in 2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year.

Therefore, the total cost of water for laundry in a year is $312.

The final answer is: $312"
"To calculate the total cost, we can break down the expenses into individual components and add them together.

The aquarium costs $10.00. Two bags of rocks, priced at $2.50 each, amount to 2 x $2.50 = $5.00. Three pieces of coral, priced at $2.00 each, total $3.00. Twenty fish, priced at $0.50 each, amount to 20 x $0.50 = $10.00. Lastly, the fish food costs $2.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $10.00 + $5.00 + $3.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $30.00.

The total amount Scarlett spent is $30.00."
"The problem at hand involves a simple exponential growth pattern, where the height of the beanstalk doubles in the second week and increases by a fixed amount in the third week. This can be modeled using the formula for exponential growth, which is A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the final amount, P is the initial amount, r is the growth rate, and n is the number of periods.

However, in this case, we are given a more straightforward problem where the growth is not exponential but rather a combination of doubling and a fixed increase. We can break it down as follows:

Week 1: Initial height = 3 inches
Week 2: Height = 3 * 2 = 6 inches
Week 3: Height = 6 + 4 = 10 inches

Therefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat he sells in a day and then divide the total weight of the bull by this daily amount.

Prince's daily meat sales can be calculated as follows:

15 kg/hour × 10 hours/day = 150 kg/day

Now, we can divide the total weight of the bull (750 kg) by the daily amount of meat sold (150 kg) to find the number of days it will take to sell the meat:

750 kg ÷ 150 kg/day = 5 days

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"To determine the number of students in the school auditorium, we must first calculate the total number of seats and then subtract the occupied seats.

The total number of seats is the product of the number of rows and the number of seats per row:
Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we need to find the number of seats occupied by administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats are occupied by administrators, we can calculate this as:
Seats occupied by administrators = 72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by administrators from the total number of seats to find the remaining seats:
Remaining seats = Total seats - Seats occupied by administrators = 72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

Since one-third of the remaining seats are occupied by parents, we can calculate this as:
Seats occupied by parents = 54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats

Finally, we subtract the seats occupied by parents from the remaining seats to find the number of seats occupied by students:
Seats occupied by students = Remaining seats - Seats occupied by parents = 54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To calculate the total number of functioning street lights, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we need to determine the total number of street lights. Given that each intersection has 4 street lights and there are 6 intersections, the total number of street lights can be calculated as follows:

Total street lights = Number of street lights per intersection * Number of intersections
Total street lights = 4 * 6
Total street lights = 24

Next, we need to subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total to find the number of functioning street lights:

Number of functioning street lights = Total street lights - Number of non-functioning street lights
Number of functioning street lights = 24 - 20
Number of functioning street lights = 4

Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is 4."
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played, we need to add the number of times each DVD has been played and subtract the number of times they have already been played.

Let's calculate the remaining lifespan of each DVD:

DVD 1: 1000 - 356 = 644 times left
DVD 2: 1000 - 135 = 865 times left

Now, let's add the remaining lifespan of both DVDs:

644 + 865 = 1509

Therefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509."
"To calculate the total cost of John's physical therapy, we can employ the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

First, we need to determine the total number of hours John attended therapy. Since he attended twice a week for 6 weeks, we can express this as:

2 sessions/week * 6 weeks = 12 sessions

Each session is 2 hours long, so the total number of hours is:

12 sessions * 2 hours/session = 24 hours

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total number of hours by the cost per hour:

24 hours * $125/hour = $3000

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000."
"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we can break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, we need to calculate the total number of pieces Jim chews throughout the day. He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school, and the school day lasts 8 hours. This can be represented as 8/2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

Additionally, Jim chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, adding 2 more pieces to his total.

The total number of pieces Jim chews throughout the day is 4 (at school) + 2 (on the way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces.

Now, we subtract the total number of pieces chewed from the initial amount of gum Jim has: 20 - 6 = 14 pieces.

Finally, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. This can be calculated as 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

Therefore, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we can utilize the concept of linear progression. Given that Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can calculate her current age by subtracting 12 from 16.

Let's denote Charmaine's current age as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

x + 12 = 16

Subtracting 12 from both sides yields:

x = 16 - 12
x = 4

Now, to find Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we add 4 to her current age:

x + 4 = 4 + 4
x + 4 = 8

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

The correct answer is: 8"
"To determine the difference in spending between the two coaches, we can calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference.

The baseball coach purchased 9 baseballs at $3 each, resulting in a total expenditure of 9 × $3 = $27.

The basketball coach purchased 8 basketballs at $14 each, resulting in a total expenditure of 8 × $14 = $112.

To find the difference in spending, we subtract the total amount spent by the baseball coach from the total amount spent by the basketball coach: $112 - $27 = $85.

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To determine the number of bloomed flowers, we can apply the concept of proportional reasoning. Since 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we can set up a proportion to find the number of bloomed flowers.

Let's denote the total number of flowers as 'x'. We know that 4/5 of 'x' represents the number of bloomed flowers. We can set up the equation:

4/5 * x = number of bloomed flowers

We are given that there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, so the total number of flowers is:
x = 10 * 20
x = 200

Now, we can substitute the value of 'x' into the equation:
4/5 * 200 = 160

Therefore, the number of bloomed flowers is 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to megabits per hour (Mb/h), we can follow these steps:

1. Convert kb/s to Mb/s: 1 Mb = 1000 kb, so divide the given speed by 1000.
   20 kb/s ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

2. Convert Mb/s to Mb/h: There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. Multiply the speed in Mb/s by 60 to get the speed in Mb/h.
   0.02 Mb/s × 60 s/min × 60 min/h = 0.02 × 60 × 60 = 72 Mb/h

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb/h."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed that week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of cars towed on the first three days and the number of cars towed on the remaining four days.

Let's denote the number of cars towed on each of the first three days as 'a' and the number of cars towed on each of the remaining four days as 'b'. We are given that 'a' is 10 and 'b' is 10 - 4 = 6.

The total number of cars towed on the first three days is 3a, and the total number of cars towed on the remaining four days is 4b. Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is 3a + 4b.

3(10) + 4(6) = 30 + 24 = 54

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to consider his current height and the required height in a unified unit of measurement.

Adam's current height is 40 inches, and the required height is 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). To find the difference, we subtract his current height from the required height:

48 - 40 = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can calculate the number of years it will take for him to reach the required height by dividing the difference by his annual growth rate:

8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

Final answer: 4"
"To calculate James' earnings, we need to determine the profit first. The cost of the cars is $25,000 each, and James sold 10 cars. So, the total cost is 10 x $25,000 = $250,000.

The company paid 30% of the cost, which is 0.3 x $250,000 = $75,000. This means the profit is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James' commission is 10% of the profit, which is 0.1 x $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To determine the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to calculate 40% of the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

First, we find 25% of 100, which is 0.25 * 100 = 25. This represents the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Next, we calculate 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10. 

Therefore, 10 women can stay upright on the wave. 

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright: 25 - 10 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total price of all three jewels, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the price of the diamond as D, the price of the gold jewel as G, and the price of the silver jewel as S.

We are given that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, which can be expressed as:

G = (4/5)D

We are also given that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, which can be expressed as:

S = G - 400

Substituting the expression for G from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

S = (4/5)D - 400

Now, we are given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, so we can substitute D = 2000 into the equations:

G = (4/5)(2000)
G = 1600

S = 1600 - 400
S = 1200

Now, we can find the total price by adding the prices of all three jewels:

Total price = D + G + S
= 2000 + 1600 + 1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

We are given the following information:

1. S = 16 (number of snowflake stamps)
2. T = S + 3 (number of truck stamps is 3 more than the number of snowflake stamps)
3. R = T - 9 (number of rose stamps is 9 fewer than the number of truck stamps)

We can substitute the value of S into the second equation to find T: T = 16 + 3 = 19.

Next, we can substitute the value of T into the third equation to find R: R = 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding the number of each type of stamp: Total = S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

Therefore, the total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative motion. Let's denote the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob as 't' hours. Since they are moving in the same direction, we can set up the equation:

75 = 55t - 70t

Combine like terms:

75 = -15t

Divide both sides by -15:

t = -75/15

t = -5

However, time cannot be negative, so we need to reconsider our approach. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Since Tom is driving 70 miles per hour and Bob is driving 55 miles per hour, the relative speed between them is 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour. To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour

Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Final answer: 5"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of fish caught by Darren as D, the number caught by Tommy as T, and the number caught by Naomi as N.

We are given that Naomi caught 17 fish, so N = 17.

We also know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, which can be expressed as T = D + 3.

Additionally, we are told that Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, so D = N - 6.

Substituting the value of N into the equation for D, we get D = 17 - 6 = 11.

Now that we have the value of D, we can find T by substituting D into the equation T = D + 3.

T = 11 + 3 = 14.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to consider the total cost of the classes and the maximum amount they are willing to pay per class.

Let's denote the total cost of the classes as $C and the maximum cost per class as $M. We are given that C = $60 and M = $10. We can calculate the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for as follows:

C / M = 60 / 10 = 6

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, we can find the maximum number of classes he can miss by subtracting the number of classes he has already attended from the total number of classes:

Maximum number of classes that can be missed = Total number of classes - Number of classes already attended
= 10 - 6
= 4

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total weekly production, we can utilize the concept of proportional reasoning. Since Julie processes twice as fast as Jewel, we can establish a ratio of their daily production. 

Let's denote Jewel's daily production as x. Then, Julie's daily production would be 2x. We know that Jewel processes 50 customers per day, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 50

Combine like terms:

3x = 50

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 50/3

x = 16.67

Now that we have Jewel's daily production, we can find Julie's daily production by multiplying x by 2:

Julie's daily production = 2x
= 2 * (50/3)
= 100/3
= 33.33

The total daily production is the sum of their individual productions:

Total daily production = Jewel's daily production + Julie's daily production
= 50 + 100/3
= 50 + 33.33
= 83.33

To find the total weekly production, we multiply the total daily production by 7:

Total weekly production = Total daily production * 7
= 83.33 * 7
= 583.31

The final answer is: $\boxed{583.31}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of miles Lynn ran as 'L'. We know that Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is 4 miles, so Reggie ran 5(4) = 20 miles. We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so we can set up the equation:

20 = L + 3

To solve for L, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

L = 20 - 3
L = 17

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To calculate the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations.

First, we need to find the cost of 5 apples. Since the cost of one apple is $5.20, we can multiply this value by 5 to get the total cost of 5 apples:

5 × $5.20 = $26.00

Next, we need to find the cost of 5 oranges. Since the cost of one orange is $3.30, we can multiply this value by 5 to get the total cost of 5 oranges:

5 × $3.30 = $16.50

Now, we can add the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to get the overall cost:

$26.00 + $16.50 = $42.50

Therefore, Clyde will pay a total of $42.50 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

The final answer is: $42.50"
"To calculate the volume of the hole, we can utilize the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length times width times height. In this case, the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the depth is 3 feet.

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume by 3 to determine the total time required.

Time = Volume * 3
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, the total time required to dig the hole is 216 seconds.

Final answer: $\boxed{216}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Bill's new truck, we can break down the costs of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade is $7,500, which is a 25% increase from the base price. This can be calculated as:

$30,000 + $7,500 = $37,500

The cost of leather seats is one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. This represents a 8.33% increase from the base price.

$30,000 + $2,500 = $32,500

The cost of running boards is $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. This represents a 6.67% increase from the base price.

$32,500 + $2,000 = $34,500

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500, which is a 4.17% increase from the base price.

$34,500 + $1,500 = $36,000

Therefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $36,000.

The final answer is: $36,000"
"To calculate Tim's new salary, we need to apply the raise and bonus to his original monthly salary.

First, we calculate the raise: 5% of $20,000 = 0.05 × $20,000 = $1,000. This represents a monthly increase of $1,000.

Next, we calculate the bonus: half a month's salary = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000. This represents an additional monthly payment of $10,000.

Now, we add the raise and bonus to the original monthly salary: $20,000 + $1,000 + $10,000 = $31,000.

To calculate the yearly salary, we multiply the new monthly salary by 12: $31,000 × 12 = $372,000.

The final answer is: $372,000"
"To calculate the total cost, we can break down the expenses into separate components and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 10 suits * $750 per suit = $7,500.

Next, we need to determine the cost of the dress pants. Since the cost of the dress pants is 1/5 of the cost of a suit, we can calculate it as follows: 1/5 * $750 = $150. Then, the total cost of the dress pants is 10 * $150 = $1,500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts: 10 shirts * $60 per shirt = $600.

Finally, we add up the costs of all the items: $7,500 + $1,500 + $600 = $9,600.

"To determine the age of Steve's son's wife, we can break down the problem into a series of logical steps. 

First, we know Steve's age and his wife's age. Since his wife is 4 years older than Steve, we can express this as an equation: 

W = S + 4, where W represents the wife's age and S represents Steve's age.

Given that Steve is 60 years old, we can substitute this value into the equation to find his wife's age: 

W = 60 + 4
W = 64

Next, we're told that their son is half as old as his mother. We can express this as another equation: 

S = 0.5W

Substituting the value of W we found earlier (64) into this equation, we can solve for S: 

S = 0.5(64)
S = 32

Now that we know the son's age, we can find the age of his wife. We're told she is 3 years younger than her husband, so we can express this as an equation: 

W = S - 3

Substituting the value of S we found earlier (32) into this equation, we can solve for W: 

W = 32 - 3
W = 29

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

First, we need to calculate the number of cupcakes for his classmates: 25 students * 2 cupcakes per student = 50 cupcakes. 

Next, we add the cupcakes for Howie and his teacher: 2 cupcakes (for Howie) + 2 cupcakes (for his teacher) = 4 cupcakes.

Now, we add the cupcakes for the students, Howie, and his teacher: 50 cupcakes + 4 cupcakes = 54 cupcakes.

Therefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the total number of likes, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we know that Fishio received 2000 likes initially. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. This means the total likes after three weeks can be calculated as follows:

Total likes after 3 weeks = 70 * Initial likes
Total likes after 3 weeks = 70 * 2000
Total likes after 3 weeks = 140,000

Then, Fishio received 20000 more new likes. To find the current total number of likes, we add these new likes to the total likes after three weeks:

Total likes = Total likes after 3 weeks + 20000
Total likes = 140,000 + 20,000
Total likes = 160,000

The final answer is 160,000."
"To determine the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we can calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, with a $2 discount. The total cost can be calculated as:

Total Cost = (Number of Pomegranates * Price per Pomegranate) - Discount
= (20 * $20) - $2
= $400 - $2
= $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, with a 10% discount. The total cost can be calculated as:

Total Cost = (Number of Pomegranates * Price per Pomegranate) - (Discount Percentage * Total Cost)
= (20 * $30) - (0.10 * $600)
= $600 - $60
= $540

The difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $398 - $540.

Final Answer: The difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142."
"To determine the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the sales from red hats in the first month as R and the sales from green hats as G.

We know that R = 1/2G and R + G = $1200. Substituting the first equation into the second, we get:

(1/2)G + G = $1200

Combine like terms:

(3/2)G = $1200

Multiply both sides by 2/3 to solve for G:

G = $1200 * (2/3)
G = $800

Now that we have the sales from green hats in the first month, we can find the sales from red hats:

R = 1/2G
R = 1/2 * $800
R = $400

The total sales in the first month were $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month, which is 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

The total sales in two months were $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To calculate the total cost of the carriage rental, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first paid hour and the remaining hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. The remaining hours are 4 - 1 = 3 hours. Since each hour after the first is twice the cost of the first hour, the cost of the remaining hours is 2 * $15 = $30 per hour.

The total cost of the remaining hours is 3 * $30 = $90. Adding the cost of the first hour, the total cost is $15 + $90 = $105.

Therefore, James paid a total of $105.

The final answer is: $105"
"To determine the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we can use the following calculation:

Weekly wage: $300
Bank account balance: $420

The difference between the weekly wage and the bank account balance represents the amount withheld. To find this difference, we subtract the bank account balance from the weekly wage:

$300 - $420 = -$120

Since the result is negative, it indicates that the bank account was overdrawn by $120. This means that $120 was withheld from Sally's wage.

The amount withheld from Sally's wage is $120."
"To determine the number of eggs Lori needs, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since each deviled egg half requires one whole egg, we can multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will consume.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'g' and the number of deviled egg halves per guest as 'd'. We are given g = 16 and d = 3. The total number of deviled egg halves required is then g * d = 16 * 3 = 48.

To find the total number of eggs needed, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2, as each egg provides 2 halves. Therefore, the total number of eggs required is 48 / 2 = 24.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can express the total number of eggs as a multiple of 12. We can do this by dividing the total number of eggs by 12: 24 / 12 = 2.

Thus, Lori will need 2 dozen eggs for her party."
"To determine the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we can use the concept of fractions. Since she has completed 1/3 of the 15-page research paper, we can calculate the remaining pages by subtracting the fraction of pages completed from the total.

Let's first convert the fraction to a decimal: 1/3 = 0.33 (rounded to two decimal places).

Now, we can calculate the number of pages left to write:

Pages left = Total pages - Pages already written
= 15 - (1/3 × 15)
= 15 - 5
= 10

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"To determine the number of days it will take Mike to finish the book, we can utilize the concept of division. The total number of pages in the book is 200, and Mike plans to read 10 pages per day. By dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages read per day, we can calculate the number of days required to complete the assignment.

Number of days = Total pages ÷ Pages per day
= 200 ÷ 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we can subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline to determine the number of days before the deadline:

Days before deadline = Deadline - Number of days
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we must consider the initial purchase price, monthly expenses, and the compounding effect of these costs over 12 months.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly rent is $5,000, and the monthly fuel cost is twice the rent, which is $10,000. 

The total monthly cost is $5,000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

$15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

Therefore, the total cost of the plane for the first year is $150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (first year's costs) = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To solve this problem, we can represent the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans as variables. Let's denote the cooking time for rice as 'r', the cooking time for pork as 'p', and the cooking time for beans as 'b'. We are given that r = 30 minutes.

We are also given that it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so we can express this as p = r + 20. Substituting the value of r, we get p = 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Additionally, we know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so we can express this as b = (p + r) / 2. Substituting the values of p and r, we get b = (50 + 30) / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for all three items: total time = r + p + b = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost difference between the two mixtures, we can calculate the cost of each component separately and then find the difference.

The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is 1/2 * $10 = $5. To find the cost of 1/3 pound walnuts, we can convert 1/3 to have a denominator of 2, which is 2/6. Then, we multiply 2/6 * $15 = $5. 

Now, we can find the total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10.

For the second mixture, we need to find the cost of 1/5 pound almonds. To do this, we can convert 1/5 to have a denominator of 2, which is 2/10. Then, we multiply 2/10 * $10 = $2. 

The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts remains the same, $5. 

Now, we can find the total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7.

To find the difference in cost between the two mixtures, we subtract the total cost of the second mixture from the total cost of the first mixture: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20.

The total number of animal legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.
The total number of animal heads can be represented as s + g = 20.

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Substituting this expression for 'g' into the first equation, we get:
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s + 40 = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

Now that we have found 's', we can verify our solution by substituting 's' into one of the original equations. Substituting 's' into the second equation, we get:
15 + g = 20
g = 5

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to determine the cost of the coffee and the donut separately. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

To find 20% of $5, we multiply $5 by 0.20, which equals $1. Therefore, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2.

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we must first calculate the total cost of the items Gus purchased, excluding the pie. 

The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00. Adding the cost of a bucket of fried chicken ($8.00) and a bottle of soda ($1.00), we get $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00.

Since Gus spent $20.00 in total, the cost of the apple pie can be found by subtracting the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is $7.00."
"To determine the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we can utilize the principle of subtraction. Given that James delivers a total of 600 newspapers and the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C are 198 and 209, respectively, we can calculate the number of newspapers delivered to District B as follows:

600 (total newspapers) - 198 (newspapers to District A) - 209 (newspapers to District C) = 193

This calculation yields the result that James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

The final answer is: $\boxed{193}$"
"To determine the total number of recipes John learns, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we calculate the total number of hours spent in the class by multiplying the number of classes per week by the duration of each class, then by the number of weeks.

Total class time = 4 classes/week * 2 hours/class = 8 hours/week
Total class time = 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours

Next, we divide the total class time by the time required to learn a new recipe to find the total number of recipes learned.

Number of recipes learned = Total class time / Time to learn a new recipe
= 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe
= 32 recipes

Therefore, John learns 32 recipes."
"To find the number of math teachers, we can calculate 100% - 60% of the total number of teachers, as the remaining percentage represents the math teachers.

Number of math teachers = 100% - 60%
= 40% of 150
= 0.4 * 150
= 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
60 * 6
= 360 hours"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to represent the amount of money each person has. Let's use A for Aurelia, K for Kassidy, and R for Rayna.

We are given that Aurelia has $120, so A = 120.

We also know that Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so K = (3/4)A = (3/4)(120) = 90.

Additionally, Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so R = K + 60 = 90 + 60 = 150.

Now, let's add up the money of all three: A + K + R = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360.

To share the money equally among them, we divide the total amount by 3: (A + K + R) / 3 = 360 / 3 = 120.

Therefore, each person would have $120.

Final answer: $120"
"To determine the total length of the game, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. The game consists of 4 quarters, each lasting 12 minutes. However, the last quarter was extended by 5 minutes due to a tie. 

We can calculate the total game time by adding the regular quarter time to the additional extension time. 

Total game time = (4 quarters * 12 minutes per quarter) + 5 minutes
Total game time = (4 * 12) + 5
Total game time = 48 + 5
Total game time = 53 minutes

Therefore, the entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"To determine the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate 20% of the total employees and then find 30% of that result.

First, find 20% of 50 employees:
0.20 * 50 = 10 employees

Now, find 30% of the 10 management employees:
0.30 * 10 = 3 employees

Therefore, there are 3 employees who oversee the entire company."
"To determine the total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins, we can apply the concept of scalar multiplication. 

For flour: 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons
For sugar: 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons
For salt: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

The total amount of dry ingredients needed is the sum of these individual quantities: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{132}$"
"To determine the amount of candy each person will receive when pooling their candy, we must first calculate the total amount of candy. This can be achieved by adding the individual amounts:

3 (Robert) + 5 (Cindy) + 4 (Aaron) = 12 pounds

Since there are three individuals sharing the candy equally, we divide the total amount by 3:

12 ÷ 3 = 4

Therefore, each person will receive 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is 4."
"To calculate the total cost of the candies, we can apply the principle of arithmetic addition. 

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 × $0.5 = $3.50.
The cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 × $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

To determine the change Adam received, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid: $15 - $11 = $4.

The final answer is $4."
"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we must first calculate the total number of good days. We know that Christina had 12 good days initially, and 3 additional good days in the next three days. 

Let's denote the number of good days as G. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

G + 3 = Total good days

We are given that the first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral. The total number of days is 30. We can calculate the number of neutral days as follows:

Neutral days = Total days - (Good days + Bad days)
Neutral days = 30 - (8 + 8)
Neutral days = 30 - 16
Neutral days = 14

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

G + 3 = 12 + 3
G + 3 = 15

Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation, we get:

G = 15 - 3
G = 12

However, we know that the first 8 days were good, and 3 additional good days were added. Therefore, the total number of good days is the sum of these two values:

Total good days = 8 + 3
Total good days = 11

Since we are asked to find the number of good days left in the month, we can subtract the total number of good days from the total number of days:

Good days left = Total days - Total good days
Good days left = 30 - 11
Good days left = 19

The correct answer is 19."
"To solve this linear equation, we can employ the fundamental principles of algebra. The given equation is:

2x + 3 = 21

Our objective is to isolate the variable x, which represents the number of books Sally has. To achieve this, we can employ the inverse operation of multiplication, which is division, and the inverse operation of addition, which is subtraction.

First, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term involving x:

2x + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

(2x) / 2 = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches and then find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach the target height.

First, we convert 20 feet to inches: 20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches.

Next, we find the remaining height: 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate: 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

Final answer: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we can break down the problem into stages.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, which means each dog requires 1 toy. This establishes a baseline of 4 toys.

As the number of dogs in the shelter increases, so does the number of toys required. With 8 additional dogs, the total becomes 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (additional dogs) = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 12 toys.

However, upon returning, the number of dogs doubles to 2 * 12 = 24 dogs. But 3 dogs are no longer present, leaving 24 - 3 = 21 dogs. Each dog still requires 1 toy, so James needs 21 toys in total.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 21.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the amount Skyler invested, we must first calculate the amount remaining after Dylan's investment. Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which can be expressed as:

(2/5) × 1200

To simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator (2) by 1200 and divide by the denominator (5):

(2 × 1200) ÷ 5 = 2400 ÷ 5 = 480

Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount:

1200 - 480 = 720

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which can be expressed as:

(2/3) × 720

To simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator (2) by 720 and divide by the denominator (3):

(2 × 720) ÷ 3 = 1440 ÷ 3 = 480

Now, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find the amount Skyler invested:

720 - 480 = 240

Therefore, Skyler's investment was $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the number of signatures the sisters need to collect, we can calculate the difference between their desired total and the number of signatures they already have.

Let's denote the number of signatures Carol has as C and the number of signatures Jennifer has as J. We know that C = 20 and J = 44. The total number of signatures they want to collect is 100. 

The equation to represent the situation is: C + J + x = 100, where x is the number of signatures they need to collect.

Substituting the known values, we get: 20 + 44 + x = 100

Combine the constants: 64 + x = 100

Subtract 64 from both sides: x = 36

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To determine Karen's earnings in two days, we must first establish her hourly wage. Given that Karen's hourly wage is twice Lorie's, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage is 2 * $10 = $20.

With this information, we can calculate Karen's daily earnings by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours worked in a day: $20 * 3 = $60.

To find Karen's earnings for two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2: $60 * 2 = $120.

The final answer is $120."
"To determine the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can utilize the concept of proportional reasoning. Given that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns, we can establish a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows:

6 potatoes : 36 hash browns

To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

Cross-multiplying, we get:

6x = 96 * 36

Simplifying, we have:

6x = 3456

Dividing both sides by 6, we obtain:

x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can be used to make 576 hash browns.

The correct answer is: 576"
"To determine the excess weight, we must first calculate the total weight of the 9 individuals. 

The weight of one adult is 80 kg, so the total weight of 9 adults is 9 * 80 kg.

Total weight = 9 * 80 kg = 720 kg

Now, we subtract the maximum load of the elevator (700 kg) from the total weight to find the excess.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

Therefore, the group of 9 adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"To solve this problem, we can represent the number of cookies each person has with variables. Let's denote the number of cookies Katarina has as K, Max has as M, the Cookie Monster has as C, and Summer has as S.

We are given the following information:

1. K = M - 5
2. M = C + 12
3. S = M + 23
4. K = 68

We can use substitution to solve for the number of cookies each person has.

From equation (1), we can express M in terms of K:
M = K + 5

Substituting this expression for M into equation (2), we get:
C + 12 = K + 5
C = K - 7

Now, we can substitute the expression for M into equation (3):
S = (K + 5) + 23
S = K + 28

Now that we have expressions for C and S in terms of K, we can find the total number of cookies:
Total cookies = K + M + C + S
Total cookies = K + (K + 5) + (K - 7) + (K + 28)
Total cookies = 4K + 26

Since we know K = 68, we can substitute this value into the expression for total cookies:
Total cookies = 4(68) + 26
Total cookies = 272 + 26
Total cookies = 298

The final answer is: $\boxed{298}$"
"To determine the original length of the dress, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the original length as x.

The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, which can be represented as 0.5x. Then, 20cm is added to the bottom of the dress. The final length of the dress is 140cm. We can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we'll first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 120

Next, we'll divide both sides by 1.5 to isolate x:

x = 120 / 1.5

x = 80

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm."
"To calculate the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we can use the concept of average speed. Since Chris mowed half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, we can find the average time by taking the arithmetic mean of the two times.

Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode = 60 minutes
Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode = 40 minutes

Average time = (60 + 40) / 2
Average time = 100 / 2
Average time = 50 minutes

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the time left to get to school without being late, we must consider the total time available and the time spent walking to the fire station.

Given that John and Jack have 30 minutes to walk to school, and they've already spent 6 minutes walking to the corner and 13 minutes walking to the fire station, we can calculate the remaining time as follows:

Time spent walking to the corner = 6 minutes
Time spent walking to the fire station = 13 minutes
Total time spent walking = 6 + 13 = 19 minutes

Time left to get to school = Total time available - Total time spent walking
= 30 - 19
= 11 minutes

Therefore, they have 11 minutes to get to school without being late."
"To calculate the total cost, we can apply the principle of arithmetic addition. 

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4. 
The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 x $2 = $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 x $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14.

Therefore, the total amount Catherine paid is $14."
"To determine the total number of cookies in the box, we must first calculate the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda. Since Greta bakes 30 cookies and Celinda bakes twice as many, we can express this as an equation:

Let's denote the number of cookies Greta bakes as G and the number of cookies Celinda bakes as C. We know that C = 2G. Given that G = 30, we can find C by substituting the value of G into the equation:

C = 2G
C = 2(30)
C = 60

Now, we can find the total number of cookies baked by adding G and C:

Total cookies = G + C
Total cookies = 30 + 60
Total cookies = 90

Since the pair eats 10 cookies, the number of cookies left in the box is:

Cookies in the box = Total cookies - 10
Cookies in the box = 90 - 10
Cookies in the box = 80

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To solve this problem, we can represent the ages of the twins and triplets algebraically. Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as x. Since there are two sets of siblings, we can represent the ages of the twins as x + 7 (the age of the older triplet) and x + 14 (the age of the older twin).

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 14 = 7.67 + 14 = 21.67.

However, since the ages must be whole numbers, we can re-examine the equation. Let's re-evaluate the ages of the twins and triplets.

Let the age of the younger triplet be x. Then, the age of the older triplet is x + 7. The age of the older twin is x + 7 + 7 = x + 14.

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 14) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x must be a whole number, we can try x = 7, which results in the following ages:

- Younger triplet: 7
- Older triplet: 7 + 7 = 14
- Older twin: 7 + 14 = 21

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 7 + 14 + 21 = 42, which is less than 44. Let's try x = 8:

- Younger triplet: 8
- Older triplet: 8 + 7 = 15
- Older twin: 8 + 14 = 22

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 8 + 15 + 22 = 45, which is greater than 44. Since x must be a whole number, we can try x = 7.5, but this is not possible since ages cannot be fractions. However, we can try x = 7.5 - 0.5 = 7, which is not a valid solution. We can try x = 7 + 0.5 = 7.5, but this is not a valid solution. We can try x = 7 + 1 = 8, which results in the following ages:

- Younger triplet: 8
- Older triplet: 8 + 7 = 15
- Older twin: 8 + 14 = 22

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 8 + 15 + 22 = 45, which is greater than 44. Let's try x = 7 - 1 = 6:

"Time Management Expert's Analysis

To determine the optimal nap duration for John, we must first calculate the total available time before dinner. Since John has 3 hours before dinner, we convert this to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Next, we sum the time allocated for homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the available time to find the remaining time for napping: 180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap.

Final Answer: The final answer is 100."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we can break down the problem into two separate equations. 

First, we'll find the cost of 10 lollipops:
10 * 0.40 = 4

Next, we'll find the cost of 10 candies:
10 * 3.20 = 32

Now, we'll add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
4 + 32 = 36

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $36."
"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 120 (12 months in a year).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 5. We can rewrite 20 as 100/5. 
So, Neil's monthly savings become 28 + 8 = 36/5 coins.

Now, we can calculate their yearly savings:
Rong's yearly savings = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's yearly savings = (36/5) * 12 = (36 * 12) / 5 = 432 / 5 = 86.4 coins

To find the total coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we multiply their yearly savings by 10:
Rong's total savings = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings = 86.4 * 10 = 864 coins

Total coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years = 2400 + 864 = 3264 coins

Final answer: 3264"
"To determine the amount John leaves with, we must first calculate the total cost of the vet visit. The cost of the vaccines is $20 per vaccine, and John's dog requires 2 vaccines. Therefore, the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. If we let 'x' represent the total bill, we can express this as 0.6x. Since the total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, we can write the equation: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To solve for x, we subtract 0.6x from both sides of the equation: 0.4x = $40. Then, we divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

Now that we know the total bill is $100, we can calculate the cost of the heartworm check: 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total cost of the vet visit is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total cost from the amount he brought: $125 - $100 = $25.

The final amount John leaves with is $25."
"To determine the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

Therefore, the total price for the crate of fruit is $32."
"To determine the total area of Brittany's comforter, we must first calculate the number of each color of squares and then sum them up.

Let's denote the number of red squares as R, blue squares as B, green squares as G, and white squares as W. We are given the following information:

R = 14
B = R + 4
G = B + 6
W = G - 12

We can substitute the expressions for B and G into the equation for W:

W = (R + 4) + 6 - 12
W = R - 2

Now, we can substitute the value of R into the equation for W:

W = 14 - 2
W = 12

Now that we have the number of each color, we can calculate the total area of the comforter:

Total area = R + B + G + W
= 14 + (14 + 4) + (14 + 4 + 6) + 12
= 14 + 18 + 24 + 12
= 68

Therefore, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to acquire, we must first establish the total number of chairs required. This can be calculated by adding the number of adults, babies, and then accounting for the ratio of regular to high chairs.

Let's denote the number of high chairs as H and the number of regular chairs as R. We are given that H = 8 and that the ratio of regular chairs to high chairs is 5:1. This implies that R = 5H.

We can now calculate the total number of chairs needed:

Total chairs = H + (number of adults) + (number of babies)
Total chairs = 8 + 42 + 15
Total chairs = 65

Since we know the ratio of regular to high chairs is 5:1, we can calculate the number of regular chairs needed:

R = 5H
R = 5 * 8
R = 40

Now, we can determine the number of chairs Mia needs to acquire by subtracting the number of high chairs from the total number of chairs:

Chairs to acquire = Total chairs - H
Chairs to acquire = 65 - 8
Chairs to acquire = 57

Therefore, Mia needs to acquire 57 more chairs."
"To determine the number of 8-point bucks, we can apply the concept of percentages. Since 20% of the bucks are 8 points, we can calculate the number of 8-point bucks by multiplying the total number of bucks by 0.2.

= 25 * 0.2
= 5

Therefore, the correct answer is 5."
"To determine the total points collected by the students, we can break down the information provided.

First, we know Adam has 50 points. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. To find 30% of 50, we can multiply 50 by 0.3, which equals 15. Therefore, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Next, we're told Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points can be calculated as 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. To find Marta's points, we multiply Tom's points by 3, resulting in 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students:
50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Marta) = 255 points.

The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold:
400 - 255 = 145 points.

The class is 145 points short of the minimum threshold to go on the trip."
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total number of great grand-babies at the family reunion. To approach this, we can utilize the concept of exponentiation, specifically the multiplication of the number of generations.

We start with the initial number of children, which is 3. Each of these children has 3 children of their own, resulting in 3^1 * 3 = 9 grandchildren. Then, each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, leading to 9^1 * 3 = 27 great grand-babies.

To generalize this, we can express the total number of great grand-babies as 3^2 * 3, which simplifies to 3^3.

Therefore, the total number of great grand-babies is 3^3 = 27.

The correct answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the amount of money Greta has left to spend after setting aside 50% for retirement and 20% for her car payment, we can calculate the deductions as follows:

Greta's original paycheck is $2400. 

First, we calculate 50% of her paycheck for retirement:
50% of $2400 = 0.5 × $2400 = $1200

Next, we calculate 20% of her paycheck for the car payment:
20% of $2400 = 0.2 × $2400 = $480

Now, we subtract the amount she puts into her retirement account and the car payment from her original paycheck:
$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720

Therefore, Greta has $720 left to spend.

The final answer is: $720"
"To determine the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we must first calculate the total number of pencils present. Given that there are 20 spaces available and 4 pencils are missing, the total number of pencils is 20 - 4 = 16.

Since a pair of pencils consists of 2 pencils, we can calculate the number of pairs by dividing the total number of pencils by 2.

16 ÷ 2 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks in the city and her backyard separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks in the city. Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of fireworks in the city = Total number of fireworks in the city * 0.4
= 15 * 20 * 0.4
= 120

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard:
Number of fireworks in backyard = Number of boxes * Number of fireworks per box
= 3 * 5
= 15

Now, we can find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see by adding the fireworks from the city and her backyard:
Total number of fireworks = Number of fireworks in the city + Number of fireworks in backyard
= 120 + 15
= 135

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"To determine the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks, we can employ a systematic approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks required. Since each person needs 2 drinks and 3 snacks, we can express this as:

Total number of drinks = 2 * (number of people)
Total number of snacks = 3 * (number of people)

Given that there are 14 people in total, we can substitute this value into the equations:

Total number of drinks = 2 * 14
Total number of drinks = 28

Total number of snacks = 3 * 14
Total number of snacks = 42

Now, we can calculate the total cost of drinks and snacks by multiplying the number of each item by their respective costs and summing the results:

Total cost = (number of drinks * cost per drink) + (number of snacks * cost per snack)
Total cost = (28 * $2) + (42 * $2)
Total cost = $56 + $84
Total cost = $140

Therefore, the group has spent $140 on snacks and drinks."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the capacity of Gary's truck as x. We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds, and Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The total capacity of the three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

4,000 + 4,800 + x = 11,600

Combine like terms:

8,800 + x = 11,600

Subtract 8,800 from both sides:

x = 2,800

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"To determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

Let's denote the number of dumplings eaten by each female as 'f' and the number of dumplings eaten by each male as 'm'. We are given that each male eats 1 more dumpling than each female, so we can express the number of dumplings eaten by each male as 'f + 1'. 

We are also given that there are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6f. Similarly, there are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8(m) = 8(f + 1).

Since we know that each female ate 3 dumplings, we can substitute f = 3 into the equation for the total number of dumplings eaten by females: 6f = 6(3) = 18.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females: 8(f + 1) + 6f = 50.

Substituting f = 3 into the equation, we get: 8(3 + 1) + 6(3) = 8(4) + 18 = 32 + 18 = 50.

This confirms that the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is indeed 50.

Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is 50.

The final answer is 50."
"When dealing with ratios and proportions, it's essential to understand the concept of equivalent ratios. In this scenario, Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. This means that for every 3 parts Gerald receives, Julia receives 2 parts.

To find Gerald's initial amount, we can set up an equation using the ratio. Let's denote Gerald's share as 3x and Julia's share as 2x. Since the total amount is $100, we can write the equation:

3x + 2x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Now that we know x, we can find Gerald's initial amount:

Gerald's share = 3x = 3(20) = 60

Gerald spent $10, so he had 60 - 10 = 50 left.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we need to apply the fundamental principles of kinematics. Given that the cat's speed is 15 feet/second and the turtle is 5 times slower, we can calculate the turtle's speed as follows:

Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 feet/second / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed × Time to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds.

Distance = 3 feet/second × 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the total number of hours as 'x'. Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can set up the equation:

$2100 + $1400x = $6300

Subtracting $2100 from both sides of the equation yields:

$1400x = $4200

Dividing both sides by $1400:

x = $4200 / $1400

x = 3

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for 3 more hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can use the following calculation:

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The city uses 40% of the river's water.
2. 80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes. To find this, we multiply 40% by 80% (or 0.4 * 0.8).
3. The result of this multiplication is 32% of the river's total water used for industrial purposes.
4. To find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100%.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

(100% - 32%) = 68%

Therefore, the city uses 68% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

Final answer: $\boxed{68}$"
"To calculate the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we can utilize the fundamental principle of multiplication. Given that there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the number of days in 2 weeks (14) by the daily rate of $12.

14 days × $12/day = $168

This calculation is a straightforward application of the distributive property of multiplication over addition, where the multiplication of 14 by $12 yields the total amount charged for 2 weeks of tutoring.

The final answer is: $168"
"To determine the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we can establish a ratio of production for each type of ice cream and then scale it up to 48 hours.

Let's analyze the given information:

- The chocolate ice cream factory produces 100 quarts in 2 hours, which translates to a rate of 50 quarts per hour.
- The vanilla ice cream factory produces 50 quarts in 4 hours, which translates to a rate of 12.5 quarts per hour.

To find the combined rate of production, we can add the individual rates:

Combined rate = 50 quarts/hour (chocolate) + 12.5 quarts/hour (vanilla) = 62.5 quarts/hour

Now, we can calculate the total number of quarts made in 48 hours:

Total quarts = Combined rate * Time
Total quarts = 62.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours
Total quarts = 3000 quarts

Therefore, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To calculate the total bill, we need to apply the 10% discount to the total cost of the items. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the items: 
5 croissants at $3.00 apiece is 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each is 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
3 mini quiches at $4.00 each is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

The total cost of all the items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

To apply the 10% discount, we calculate 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should purchase, we can apply the concept of fractional parts to the deal. Since the deal is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free,"" we can consider the cost of 3 scoops as the cost of 2 scoops.

The cost of 3 scoops is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00. 

Now, we can divide Erin's budget of $6.00 by the cost of 3 scoops to find the maximum number of sets she can afford:

$6.00 ÷ $3.00 = 2

Since each set consists of 3 scoops, we can multiply the number of sets by 3 to find the total number of scoops:

2 sets * 3 scoops/set = 6 scoops

Therefore, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the amount of candy each individual has after two weeks, we can apply the concept of linear decay. 

Let's calculate the total number of pieces each person consumes over the 14-day period. Ginger's daily consumption is 4 pieces, so her total consumption is 4 * 14 = 56 pieces. Similarly, Amy's daily consumption is 3 pieces, resulting in a total of 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.

To find the difference in their remaining candy, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the number of mosaic tiles needed to cover two thirds of a 36 square foot bathroom, we can use the concept of proportional reasoning. 

We know that Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot. To find the number of tiles required for two thirds of the bathroom, we can multiply the number of tiles per square foot by the fraction representing two thirds.

Let's calculate: (2/3) * 36 = 24

Now, we multiply 24 tiles per square foot by 24 square feet:

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

576"
"To determine the cost-effectiveness of James' decision, we must calculate the total cost of both options and compare them.

The cost of picking blueberries can be calculated as follows:

Initial cost: $20
Additional cost per pound: $1.50
Total pounds picked: 30

Total cost of picking blueberries = Initial cost + (Additional cost per pound * Total pounds picked)
= $20 + ($1.50 * 30)
= $20 + $45
= $65

On the other hand, the cost of buying blueberries at the store is given as $2.50 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds. Therefore, the total cost of buying blueberries at the store is:

Total cost of buying blueberries = Cost per pound * Total pounds picked
= $2.50 * 30
= $75

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying:

Savings = Total cost of buying blueberries - Total cost of picking blueberries
= $75 - $65
= $10

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself.

$10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we need to first find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we can calculate the increase in price as follows:

Increase in price = 10% of $700 = 0.10 x $700 = $70

New price of each computer = Original price + Increase in price
= $700 + $70
= $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers.

Total amount paid = New price of each computer x Number of computers
= $770 x 500
= $385,000

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid is $385,000."

- Time spent with arms up: 2 minutes

Taps per minute with arms down: 550 (300 + 250)
Taps per minute with arms up: 400

Total taps = (Taps per minute with arms down * Time spent with arms down) + (Taps per minute with arms up * Time spent with arms up)
Total taps = (550 * 3) + (400 * 2)
Total taps = 1650 + 800
Total taps = 2450

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"The problem at hand involves a straightforward calculation to determine the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself. To achieve this, we must consider the total cost of repairing the pothole and compare it to the cost of the fine and the cost of the asphalt.

The total cost of fixing the pothole can be calculated as the sum of the damage to the car, the fine, and the cost of the asphalt. This can be expressed as:

Total Cost = Damage to the car + Fine + Cost of asphalt
Total Cost = $450 + $120 + $75
Total Cost = $645

To find the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we subtract the total cost from the cost of the fine:

Savings = Cost of fine
Savings = $120

Therefore, Ron saves $120 by fixing the pothole himself.

"To determine the total number of chairs left, we must first calculate the initial total and then subtract the number of chairs sent for repair.

The initial total number of chairs is the sum of normal chairs and baby chairs: 170 + 23 = 193.

Next, we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair: 193 - (20 + 13).

Using the associative property of addition, we can rewrite the expression as: 193 - 20 - 13.

Now, we perform the subtractions: 193 - 20 = 173, then 173 - 13 = 160.

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 of the total pizza. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 60: (4/3) x 60 = 80 slices.

However, we need to consider that 4/3 is greater than 1, which means they ate more slices than the total number of slices available. This is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Since Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, they ate 2/3 x 12 = 8 slices each. So, they ate a total of 8 x 3 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we need to subtract the slices eaten by all 5 friends from the total number of slices: 60 - 24 - 18 = 18 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we can utilize the concept of proportional reasoning. Since the dog eats the same number of sausages as the cat, we can establish a ratio of time to sausages for each animal.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes, so its time-to-sausage ratio is 30 minutes per 9 sausages. To find the time it takes the dog to eat the same number of sausages, we can multiply the cat's time-to-sausage ratio by 2/3, as the dog takes 2/3 of the time the cat takes.

The dog's time-to-sausage ratio is (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes per 9 sausages.

Now, to find the average time it takes both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we can calculate the harmonic mean of their time-to-sausage ratios. The harmonic mean of two numbers is calculated as 2ab / (a + b), where a and b are the time-to-sausage ratios.

The harmonic mean of the cat's and dog's time-to-sausage ratios is 2 * 30 * 20 / (30 + 20) = 1200 / 50 = 24 minutes.

Therefore, the average time it takes both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is 24 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We are given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be written as an equation:

9x + 10 = length of Topher's shoe

We are also given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. To convert this to inches, we multiply the feet by 12 and add the inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.

Now we can substitute 100 inches for the length of Topher's shoe in the equation:

9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

9x = 90

Dividing both sides by 9 gives us:

x = 10

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"

"To determine the percentage of blue spools, we must first calculate the total number of blue spools and the total number of spools.

The total number of blue spools is the sum of light blue and dark blue spools: 15 + 45 = 60.

The total number of spools is the sum of all spools: 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to find the number of people who voted by midday. Since 2/5 of the 5000 people had voted, we can calculate this as:

(2/5) × 5000 = (2 × 5000) / 5 = 10,000 / 5 = 2000

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of people to find the remaining people:
5000 - 2000 = 3000

Next, we need to find 2/3 of the remaining people, which is:
(2/3) × 3000 = (2 × 3000) / 3 = 6000 / 3 = 2000

Now, we subtract this number from the remaining people to find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00:
3000 - 2000 = 1000

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000.

The final answer is: 1000"

"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers required, we must first calculate the total number of smores needed. This can be achieved by adding the number of smores for kids and adults.

Let's calculate the total number of smores: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores, and 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores. The sum of these two quantities is 18 + 6 = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, we can divide the total number of smores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed: 24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Given that there are 3 sleeves in a box, we can conclude that 3 boxes of graham crackers are required to meet the demand.

"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote Dora's age as 'D', her father's age as 'F', and her mother's age as 'M'. We are given the following information:

1. Dora's age is 15 years: D = 15
2. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age: F = 2D + 8
3. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father: M = F - 4

Substituting the value of D into the equation for F, we get:
F = 2(15) + 8
F = 30 + 8
F = 38

Now, substituting the value of F into the equation for M, we get:
M = 38 - 4
M = 34

The combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is the sum of their individual ages:
Combined age = D + F + M
= 15 + 38 + 34

"To solve this problem, we can represent the number of books each person has with variables. Let's denote the number of books Steven has as 'S' and the number of books Alice has as 'A'. We are given that Clara has two times as many books as Steven, so we can express this as an equation: 

A = 2S

We are also given that Alice has 6 more books than Steven, which can be represented as:

A = S + 6

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for A from the second equation into the first equation:

2S = S + 6

Subtracting S from both sides gives us:

S = 6

Now that we know Steven has 6 books, we can find out how many books Alice has by substituting S into one of the original equations:

A = 2S
A = 2(6)
A = 12

Now that we know Alice has 12 books, we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice by subtracting Alice's total from Clara's total:

Clara's total - Alice's total = 20 - 12
= 8

"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the number of students who like to play basketball, which is given as 5. Since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, we can calculate the number of students who like to play music as 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we know that the total number of students is 50, and the number of students who like to bake is 10. We can subtract the number of students who like to bake and play basketball from the total number of students to find the number of students who like to play video games or music. This gives us 50 - (10 + 5) = 35.

However, we are asked to find the number of students who like to play video games. Since the number of students who like to play music is 10, we can subtract this from the total number of students who like video games or music to find the number of students who like to play video games. This gives us 35 - 10 = 25.

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total number of birds in the backyard, we must first calculate the number of birds that were scared away. This can be achieved by multiplying the initial number of birds (12) by the fraction 1/3.

12 × (1/3) = 12/3 = 4

Now, we subtract the number of birds scared away from the initial number of birds to find the remaining birds.

12 - 4 = 8

Next, we add the 20 birds that joined the backyard to the remaining birds.

8 + 20 = 28

Therefore, the total number of birds in the backyard is 28.

The final answer is 28."
"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can use the concept of percentages. Given that 40% of the students in each class are girls, we can calculate the number of boys by subtracting the percentage of girls from 100%.

Let's denote the total number of students in each class as x. Since there are 80 students in total, we can set up the equation:

x + x = 80 (since there are two classes with the same number of students)

Combine like terms:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 students in each class, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the total number of students by (100% - 40%) or 0.6 (since 100% - 40% = 60%).

Number of boys = 40 * 0.6
= 24

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class.

24"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) and apply the arithmetic operations step by step.

First, we add the initial 3 slices to the 2 slices already on the plate: 2 + 3 = 5.

Next, we triple the result: 5 × 3 = 15.

Then, we subtract the 2 slices Mara ate: 15 - 2 = 13.

Finally, we subtract the 5 slices her friend stole: 13 - 5 = 8.

Therefore, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of animals Melissa will groom each day, we must first calculate the total number of animals in need of grooming. This can be achieved by summing the individual counts of each type of animal.

Total number of animals = 8 (dogs) + 5 (cats) + 3 (birds) + 12 (horses)
Total number of animals = 28

To find the number of animals groomed per day, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week (7).

28 ÷ 7 = 4

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

Final Answer: The final answer is 4."
"To calculate the profit, we must first determine the total cost of the packs Mark purchased. Since he bought 3 packs at $1800 each, the total cost is:

3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400

Next, we calculate the total value of the cards Mark found. This includes the two cards worth $4000 and $1000, as well as the 30 cards worth $50 each. The total value of the 30 cards is:

30 cards * $50 per card = $1500

Now, we add the values of the two high-value cards to the total value of the 30 cards:

$4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

$6500 - $5400 = $1100

Therefore, Mark's profit is $1100."
"To determine the cost of each amusement park, we can apply the principles of arithmetic. 

The cost of the first amusement park can be calculated as follows:

Cost of the first amusement park = (2 adults * $26) + (2 children * $12)
Cost of the first amusement park = $52 + $24
Cost of the first amusement park = $76

The cost of the second amusement park can be calculated as follows:

Cost of the second amusement park = (2 adults * $14) + (2 children * $10)
Cost of the second amusement park = $28 + $20
Cost of the second amusement park = $48

To find the amount saved by choosing the second amusement park, we can subtract the cost of the second amusement park from the cost of the first amusement park:

Amount saved = Cost of the first amusement park - Cost of the second amusement park
Amount saved = $76 - $48
Amount saved = $28

Therefore, the family will be able to save $28 by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

The final answer is: $28"
"The art of arithmetic. A fundamental aspect of mathematics that governs the world around us. As an expert in this domain, I shall apply my knowledge to solve the problem at hand.

The vendor's daily savings can be calculated by finding the difference between the original cost and the new cost. This can be expressed as:

Daily savings = Original cost - New cost
= (500 * 0.5) - (500 * 0.4)
= 250 - 200
= 50

To determine the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7:

Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7
= 50 * 7
= 350

Therefore, the vendor saves $350 per week by switching vendors.

The final answer is: $350"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize the given information to establish a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of marbles Carl has as C, Sean has as S, and Cal has as L.

We are given that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so we can express this relationship as:

S = (1/2)L

We are also given that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so we can express this relationship as:

C = 4S

Substituting the expression for S from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

C = 4((1/2)L)
C = 2L

Now, we are given that Sean has 56 marbles, so we can substitute S = 56 into the first equation:

56 = (1/2)L
L = 56 * 2
L = 112

Now that we have found L, we can find C by substituting L into the equation C = 2L:

C = 2(112)
C = 224

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add C and L:

Total = C + L
Total = 224 + 112
Total = 336

The final answer is: $\boxed{336}$"
"To determine the number of groups needed, we must first recognize that the question is based on a misunderstanding. The activity already requires 12 groups, and the 54 students are to be separated into these 12 groups. 

Since the number of students (54) is already evenly divisible by the number of groups (12), there are no additional groups required. The students are already grouped according to the specified requirement.

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month. There are 20 weekdays (4 weeks * 5 weekdays per week), and each weekday, 60 chairs are rented. So, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month is:

20 weekdays * 60 chairs/weekday = 1200 chairs

Next, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month. There are 8 weekend days (4 weeks * 2 weekend days per week), and each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented. So, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month is:

8 weekend days * 100 chairs/weekend day = 800 chairs

Now, we add the total chairs rented during weekdays and weekends in a 4-week month:

1200 chairs + 800 chairs = 2000 chairs

To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we multiply the total chairs rented in one month by 2:

2000 chairs * 2 = 4000 chairs

The final answer is: 4000"
"To determine the number of bananas Gunther found, we can analyze the sequence of events:

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas. Arnold stole half of them, leaving Gunther with 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. Then, Gunther added 25 bananas, resulting in a total of 24 + 25 = 49 bananas. However, Arnold stole 12 bananas, reducing the total to 49 - 12 = 37 bananas. Finally, Gunther added 6 bananas, yielding a final count of 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, the correct answer is 43 bananas.

"To determine the yearly electricity bill per roommate, we can utilize the concept of proportional sharing. Given that the monthly electricity bill is $100 and there are 4 roommates, we can calculate the monthly share per roommate as follows:

$100 ÷ 4 = $25 per roommate per month

To find the yearly share, we multiply the monthly share by 12:

$25 × 12 = $300 per roommate per year

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity, assuming the monthly bill remains constant and the roommates divide the share equally."
"To determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we must consider the initial quantities and the number of items that were returned.

The initial quantities are 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we can express these quantities as 8 * 12 = 96 glasses and 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

When the items were returned, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. To find the remaining quantities, we subtract the number of broken items from the initial quantities.

Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86
Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42

The total number of remaining items is the sum of the remaining glasses and plates: 86 + 42 = 128.

The final answer is: $\boxed{128}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two separate transactions: the trade of small stickers for large buttons and the trade of large stickers for small buttons.

First, let's calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine receives from trading 90% of her small stickers. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, the number of large buttons she receives is equal to the number of small stickers she trades, which is 90% of 30, or 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. Therefore, she receives 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

Next, let's calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine receives from trading 50% of her large stickers. Since each large button is worth three small stickers, the number of large buttons she receives is equal to the number of small stickers she trades, which is 50% of 40, or 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. Therefore, she receives 20 large buttons.

Now, let's calculate the number of small buttons Lorraine receives from trading the remaining large stickers. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, the number of small buttons she receives is equal to 3 times the number of large stickers she trades, which is 3 * (40 - 20) = 3 * 20 = 60 small stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 3 small stickers (initially remaining) + 60 small stickers (from trading large stickers) = 63 small stickers and 20 large stickers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{83}$"
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in a week, we can apply basic arithmetic principles. 

First, we need to identify the number of matches played on each day. Joey played 2 matches on Monday, 1 match on Friday, and double the number of matches on Saturday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, he played 2 x 2 = 4 matches on Saturday.

Now, we can calculate the total number of matches played by adding the matches played on each day: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7.

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as x. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. This gives us the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combining like terms, we get:

3x = 33

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

x = 11

Now that we have the value of x, we can determine the number of votes in favor of the new regulation by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2(11) = 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

Final answer: $\boxed{22}$"

11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

Therefore, the total number of shirts ordered is 75."
"When calculating the amount after a discount, it's essential to apply the discount percentage to the marked price. In this case, we have a 5% discount on a marked price of $140.

To find the discount amount, we multiply the marked price by the discount percentage (as a decimal). The discount percentage is 5%, which is equivalent to 0.05 as a decimal.

Discount amount = Marked price x Discount percentage
= $140 x 0.05
= $7

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the marked price to find the final amount to be paid.

Final amount = Marked price - Discount amount
= $140 - $7
= $133

Therefore, the amount to be paid after the 5% discount is $133."
"To calculate the total number of hours the playlists will last, we can employ the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

First, we multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist to obtain the total number of songs: 20 playlists * 300 songs/playlist = 6000 songs.

Next, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song to determine the total hours: 6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60,000 hours.

Therefore, the 20 playlists will last for 60,000 hours in total.

"To determine the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we need to calculate the percentage of remaining people after considering those who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win.

First, we find the number of people who think horse #2 will win: 20% of 50 people, which is 0.20 * 50 = 10 people.

Next, we calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win: 60% of the remaining 40 people, which is 0.60 * 40 = 24 people.

Now, we subtract the total number of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total number of people: 10 + 24 = 34 people.

The number of people who think horse #12 will win is the remaining people, which is 50 - 34 = 16 people.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward approach using fractions. We know that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. We can set up the equation: 
1/3 * P = 6

To isolate P, we can multiply both sides by 3:
P = 6 * 3
P = 18

Now that we have the total number of Pomeranians, we can find the total number of puppies. Since 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up another equation:
2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:
Total Puppies = 18 * 3/2
Total Puppies = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"To determine the amount Jayden needs to purchase the camera, we must first calculate the total amount of money he has. Jayden initially had $70 from selling pictures. His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. We can express this as:

$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200, so we subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera to find the remaining amount needed:

$200 - $115 = $85

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

Final Answer: The final answer is $85."
"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cases needed for the first house as x. Since the second house needs half of the total, its cases can be represented as x/2. The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so its cases can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x/2 + 2x = 250

To solve for x, we can first multiply every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + x + 4x = 500

Combine like terms:

7x = 500

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 500/7

x = 71.43

Since the third house needs double the amount of the first house, we can multiply x by 2:

Third house cases = 2x
= 2 * 71.43
≈ 142.86

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a case, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the third house needs approximately 142 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 142"

The total expenditure is the sum of these individual expenditures: $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

Therefore, the total amount spent by the three individuals is $14."
"To determine the total number of fruits, we can use the concept of percentages. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can express this relationship as:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + (45% of Number of bananas)

Let's represent the number of bananas as 'b'. Then, the number of pears can be expressed as:

Number of pears = b + 0.45b
= 1.45b

We are given that George has 200 bananas, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

Number of pears = 1.45b
= 1.45 * 200
= 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
= 200 + 290
= 490

Therefore, George has a total of 490 fruits."
"To determine the number of candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we can employ a straightforward subtraction and division approach.

First, we subtract the cost of the ball from Marissa's initial amount of money to find the remaining funds available for purchasing candy bars.

Remaining funds = Initial amount of money - Cost of the ball
Remaining funds = $80 - $20
Remaining funds = $60

Next, we divide the remaining funds by the cost of each candy bar to find the number of candy bars Marissa purchased.

Number of candy bars = Remaining funds ÷ Cost of each candy bar
Number of candy bars = $60 ÷ $5
Number of candy bars = 12

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy."
"To determine the total cost of making 4 liters of juice, we can utilize the concept of unitary method. 

First, we establish the cost per unit of oranges, which is $3 per kilogram. To find the cost of 20 kilograms of oranges, we multiply the cost per kilogram by the number of kilograms: 3 * 20 = $60.

Therefore, the total cost of making 4 liters of juice is $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the total number of books read, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we know that Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. Given that Ezra read 300 books in one hour, we can deduce that Ahmed read half of that amount. 

Let's calculate Ahmed's book count: 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we'll add the number of books Ezra read initially (300) to the number of books he read later (150), and also add the number of books Ahmed read (150).

300 + 150 + 150 = 600

Therefore, the total number of books read is 600.

Final answer: $\boxed{600}$"
"To determine Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we can break down her earnings into two components: the hourly wage and the daily bonus.

First, let's calculate her earnings for Monday. She teaches 4 classes for 5 hours, earning $15 per hour. This can be represented as:

4 classes * 5 hours = 20 hours
20 hours * $15 per hour = $300

Next, we need to determine if she earns the daily bonus. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day. We can represent this as:

$5 per day * 2 days = $10

Now, we can calculate her total earnings for Monday and Wednesday by adding her hourly earnings and the daily bonus:

$300 + $10 = $310

Therefore, Tanya's total earnings for the two days is $310.

"To determine the selling price of each ear of corn, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the selling price of each ear of corn as x.

We know that Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total revenue from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60. We also know that he wants to make a total of $135 and has 25 ears of corn to sell. The total revenue from corn should be $135 - $60 = $75.

The equation representing the situation is:

20 * 3 + 25x = 135

Simplifying the equation, we get:

60 + 25x = 135

Subtracting 60 from both sides:

25x = 75

Dividing both sides by 25:

x = 75/25

x = 3

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

Final answer: $3"
"To determine the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we must first calculate the total time devoted to non-soccer activities. 

Time spent reading = 3 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * (12 - 3) = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Total time spent on non-soccer activities = Time spent reading + Time spent playing video games
Total time spent on non-soccer activities = 3 + 3 = 6 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total weekend time - Total time spent on non-soccer activities
Time spent playing soccer = 12 - 6 = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer is 50%."
"To determine the number of pencils Anthony kept, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the number of pencils Anthony gave to Brandon. Since he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, we can calculate this as:

1/2 * 50 = 25

Now, we subtract the pencils given to Brandon from the total:

50 - 25 = 25

Next, we need to find 3/5 of the remaining pencils, which is:

3/5 * 25 = 15

Now, we subtract the pencils given to Charlie from the remaining pencils:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we must consider the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

First, we calculate the total driving time. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a constant speed of 75 miles per hour. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time taken to drive to the museum = 2 hours

Since Jack drives at the same speed for the return trip, the time taken to drive back home is also 2 hours.

Total driving time = Time taken to drive to the museum + Time taken to drive back home
Total driving time = 2 hours + 2 hours
Total driving time = 4 hours

Next, we add the time spent at the museum to the total driving time to find the total time Jack is gone from home.

Total time Jack is gone from home = Total driving time + Time spent at the museum
Total time Jack is gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time Jack is gone from home = 10 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of wheels left, we must first calculate the total number of wheels required for the assembly of the toys. 

The number of wheels needed for the cars is 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels. 
The number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels. 
The total number of wheels required is 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

Now, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the number of wheels available in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

Therefore, the number of wheels left is 276."
"To calculate the discounted price, we can apply the concept of percentage decrease. The formula for finding the amount of the discount is:

Discount = (Percentage / 100) * Original Price

In this case, the original price is $1000 and the discount is 20%. Plugging in the values, we get:

Discount = (20 / 100) * $1000
= 0.20 * $1000
= $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price to find the final amount to be paid:

Final Amount = Original Price - Discount
= $1000 - $200
= $800

Therefore, the amount to be paid after the 20% discount is $800."
"To calculate the cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we can break it down into steps.

First, we need to find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as:

(1/3) × 600 = 200 movies

The cost of these series can be found by dividing the total cost of individual movies by 6:

(200 × $10) / 6 = $333.33

Next, we need to find the number of movies that are not in series. Since 200 movies are in series, we subtract this from the total number of movies:

600 - 200 = 400 movies

Now, we can calculate the number of older movies, which is 40% of the remaining movies:

0.4 × 400 = 160 movies

The cost of these older movies can be found by multiplying the number of older movies by their cost:

160 × $5 = $800

The remaining movies that are not in series or older movies are:

400 - 160 = 240 movies

Since these movies are not in series or older movies, they cost $10 each. The total cost of these movies is:

240 × $10 = $2400

Finally, we add up the cost of the series, the older movies, and the remaining movies to find the total cost:

$333.33 + $800 + $2400 = $3533.33

The final answer is: $3533.33"
"To calculate the total cost of the fruit, we can apply the principle of weighted averages.

"To determine the distance to their vacation spot, we can utilize the concept of average speed and the formula for distance. 

Let's denote the driving speed as 'd' and the hiking speed as 'h'. We are given that the driving speed is 50 miles per hour, so d = 50. We also know that the hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half of the driving speed, which can be expressed as h = (d/2) - 5.

Substituting the value of d into the equation for h, we get:
h = (50/2) - 5
h = 25 - 5
h = 20

Now, we can use the formula for distance, which is Distance = Speed * Time. We are given that the time spent driving is 6 hours and the time spent hiking is 1.5 hours. Let's denote the total time as 't'. Since the total time is the sum of the driving time and hiking time, we can express this as t = 6 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

We can now set up an equation using the formula for distance, where the total distance is the sum of the distance traveled while driving and the distance traveled while hiking. Since the distance traveled while driving is the product of the driving speed and the driving time, and the distance traveled while hiking is the product of the hiking speed and the hiking time, we can express this as:

Total Distance = d * t + h * t
50 * 6 + 20 * 1.5

Now, we can simplify the equation:
Total Distance = 300 + 30
Total Distance = 330

Therefore, the distance to their vacation spot is 330 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{330}$"
"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's denote Emma's score as E and Ava's score as A. We know that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so Ava's enemy points are 10 times the number of enemies she jumps on, which can be expressed as 10(8 + x), where x is the number of enemies Emma jumps on. Emma, on the other hand, jumps on x enemies.

Ava's enemy points = 10(8 + x) = 80 + 10x

Since Emma collects 3 fewer berries than Ava, Emma's berry points are 5 times the number of berries she collects, which can be expressed as 5(8 - 3) = 5(5) = 25. Ava's berry points are 5 times the number of berries she collects, which can be expressed as 5(5 + 3) = 5(8) = 40.

Ava's berry points = 40

Ava's time points are 30 times the number of seconds left on the timer when she finishes the level, which can be expressed as 30(30 - 4) = 30(26) = 780.

Ava's time points = 780

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the scores:

A = 80 + 10x + 40 + 780
E = x + 25 + 26x

To find the difference in scores, we can set up an equation:

A - E = (80 + 10x + 40 + 780) - (x + 25 + 26x)
A - E = 900 - 27x

We are given that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so we can substitute x = 8 into the equation:

A - E = 900 - 27(8)
A - E = 900 - 216
A - E = 684

The final answer is: $\boxed{684}$"
"To determine the cost of the remaining two pizzas, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of each of the remaining two pizzas as 'x'. Since the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, and two of them cost 30 dollars, we can set up the following equation:

2x + 30 = 64

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation yields:

2x = 34

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 17

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas costs 17 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the usual days and the extra days.

On the usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. This can be calculated using the formula for multiplication of a constant rate over a fixed interval:

Total rides on usual days = 3 rides/day * 5 days = 3 × 5 = 15

On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is 2 * 3 = 6 rides per day. 

Total rides on extra days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 6 × 2 = 12

Now, we add the total number of times for both the usual days and the extra days:

Total rides in a week = Total rides on usual days + Total rides on extra days
= 15 + 12
= 27

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's say the number of white fish Bob bought is x. The total number of white fish after adding the new fish is 4 + x. The total number of orange fish after adding the new fish is 3 + 14 = 17.

Since Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + 14 = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

17 = 8 + 2x

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

9 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

4.5 = x

However, since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, we need to find the closest whole number that satisfies the equation. Let's try x = 4 and x = 5.

"To determine the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car, we must consider the total distance driven and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.

Given that the one-way distance between Andy's home and office is 5 miles, and he commutes 5 days a week, the total round-trip distance is:

Total distance per week = 2 * 5 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week

Since the fuel efficiency of Andy's car is 10 miles per gallon (MPG), we can calculate the gas consumed per week as follows:

Gas consumed per week = Total distance per week / Fuel efficiency
Gas consumed per week = 50 miles/week / 10 MPG
Gas consumed per week = 5 gallons/week

To find the cost of gas consumed per week, we multiply the gas consumed per week by the price per gallon:

Cost of gas consumed per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = $15/week

The final answer is: $15"
"To calculate the total amount Carrie paid for lunch, we need to determine the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, then add them together.

Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. To find the value of the twenties she spent, we can multiply the number of twenties by the fraction she spent: (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, the value of the twenties she spent is 6 * $20 = $120.

Carrie was also given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the value of the quarters she spent is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

The total amount she spent is $120 + $35 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To determine the total number of fruits, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total number of tomatoes by multiplying the number of plants by the yield per plant: 5 * 22 = 110.

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants by multiplying the number of plants by the yield per plant: 8 * 4 = 32.

Finally, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the overall total: 110 + 32 = 142.

Therefore, Ricardo can expect to harvest 142 fruits from his garden."
"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we must first calculate the combined fraction of non-OLED TVs sold. The fraction of smart TVs is 1/4, and the fraction of analog TVs is 1/8. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 8. 

We can rewrite 1/4 as 2/8. Now, we can add the fractions: 2/8 + 1/8 = 3/8. This represents the combined fraction of non-OLED TVs sold.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, we can multiply the combined fraction by the total number of TVs to find the number of non-OLED TVs sold: (3/8) * 40 = 15.

To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we subtract the number of non-OLED TVs from the total number of TVs: 40 - 15 = 25.

The final answer is 25."
"To determine the amount of money John is missing, we need to calculate the difference between the total cost of the trip and the amount he has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school is covering half the cost, the school will pay $300 / 2 = $150. 

Now, we subtract the amount John has from the total cost of the trip: $300 - $150 = $150.

Therefore, John is missing $150.

Final answer: $150"
"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn, we must first calculate the temperature difference between the day and night. The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder during the night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can calculate the number of logs needed by dividing the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log: 12 / 5 = 2.4.

However, since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the house is warm enough. Therefore, Carson needs to burn at least 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The correct answer is: 3"
"To determine the number of seashells brought back, we first need to calculate the number of groups. Since 90 people are to be divided into 9-person groups, we can find the number of groups by performing integer division.

Number of groups = Total number of people ÷ Number of people in each group
= 90 ÷ 9
= 10

Now, we need to find 3/5 of the number of groups, as 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells. To do this, we multiply the number of groups by 3/5.

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * Number of groups
= 3/5 * 10
= 6

Since each group had 2 seashells, the total number of seashells brought back is the product of the number of groups with seashells and the number of seashells per group.

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2
= 12

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of people on the train after the two stops, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initial number of people on the train: 172
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off, and 13 people get on. To find the new total, we subtract the number of people who got off and add the number of people who got on: 172 - 47 + 13 = 138.
3. At the next stop, 38 people get off. To find the final total, we subtract the number of people who got off from the previous total: 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, the final number of people on the train is 100.

Final answer: 100"
"The calculation for determining Damien's monthly earnings can be broken down into a straightforward arithmetic problem. To find the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we can multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the number of days in the month and then multiply that result by the value of each bottle cap.

Let's apply the formula: Total Earnings = (Number of Bottle Caps per Day * Number of Days in the Month) * Value of Each Bottle Cap

Plugging in the given values, we get:

Total Earnings = (10 * 30) * $0.25

First, we multiply the number of bottle caps per day by the number of days in the month:
10 * 30 = 300

Next, we multiply the result by the value of each bottle cap:
300 * $0.25 = $75

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To calculate Jamie's total earnings, we need to break down her work into two segments: the regular 8 hours and the additional hours worked at the special rate.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours. Her hourly rate is $20, so her earnings for 8 hours are:

8 hours × $20/hour = $160

Next, we need to calculate her earnings for the additional 3 hours worked at the special rate of 150% of her regular rate. To find the special rate, we multiply her regular rate by 1.5:

$20/hour × 1.5 = $30/hour

Now, we can calculate her earnings for the additional 3 hours:

3 hours × $30/hour = $90

To find her total earnings, we add her earnings for the regular hours and the additional hours:

$160 + $90 = $250

Therefore, Jamie's total earnings for the day are $250.

Final answer: $250"
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate the number of male lions, which is half the number of female lions. Since there are 12 female lions, we can express this as:

Number of male lions = 12 / 2 = 6

Next, we add the number of male lions, female lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions:

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To calculate the amount of money Mike will have left over after purchasing the jeans, we can apply the concept of percentage discount to the original price of the jeans.

The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are on sale for 25% off. To find the discounted price, we can multiply the original price by the discount percentage (as a decimal) and subtract the result from the original price.

Discount = 25% = 0.25
Discounted price = Original price - (Discount x Original price)
= $40 - (0.25 x $40)
= $40 - $10
= $30

Now, we can calculate the amount of money Mike will have left over after paying with a $50 bill:

Amount left over = $50 - $30
= $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. 

Let's break it down:

Initial number of employees: 200
Number of new employees hired per month: 20
Total number of months: 3

The total number of employees after 3 months can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

S = n/2 * (a1 + an)

where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, n = 3 (number of months), a1 = 200 (initial number of employees), and an = 200 + (20 * 3) = 260 (total number of employees after 3 months).

S = 3/2 * (200 + 260)
S = 1.5 * 460
S = 690

Now, we can calculate the total salary paid per month by multiplying the total number of employees by the salary per employee:

Total salary paid per month = 260 * $4000
Total salary paid per month = $1,040,000

Finally, we can calculate the total salary paid after 3 months by multiplying the total salary paid per month by the number of months:

Total salary paid after 3 months = $1,040,000 * 3
Total salary paid after 3 months = $3,120,000

The final answer is: $3,120,000"
"To determine the total caroling time, we can utilize the concept of multiplication and addition. 

The choir plans to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice, which is equivalent to 2 x 150 seconds. This can be calculated as 2 * 150 = 300 seconds.

Additionally, they will sing ""Jingle Bells"" once, which is a fixed duration of 240 seconds. 

Now, we can find the total caroling time by adding the time for both songs: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

Therefore, the choir will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"To determine the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally, we need to calculate their individual hourly wages and then multiply by the number of hours worked.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After a $0.50 per hour raise, his new wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. On his first anniversary, he received a $1.00 per hour raise, resulting in a final wage of $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's starting hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's initial wage, so it is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. Since she also works 20 hours, her total earnings are $10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $11.50 * 20 - $210 = $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the cost difference between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we can apply basic arithmetic principles.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is calculated as 3 times the cost of one loaf, which is $2. This results in a total cost of 3 × $2 = $6.

Similarly, the cost of 2 bagels is found by multiplying the cost of one bagel, which is $1, by 2, yielding a total cost of 2 × $1 = $2.

Now, we can find the difference in cost by subtracting the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

Final answer: $4"
"To determine the total score of Pierson and Nikita, we must first calculate Nikita's score. Since Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, we can express this as:

Nikita's score = (Pierson's score / 2) + 11

Given Pierson's score is 278, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Nikita's score = (278 / 2) + 11
Nikita's score = 139 + 11
Nikita's score = 150

Now, we can find the total score by adding Pierson's and Nikita's scores:

Total score = Pierson's score + Nikita's score
Total score = 278 + 150
Total score = 428

Therefore, the total score of Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To calculate the total number of trees planted, we can break down the problem into two components: the number of trees planted by students and the number of trees planted by teachers.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by students. With 40 classes and an average of 25 students per class, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000. Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by students is also 1000.

Next, we calculate the number of trees planted by teachers. With 40 classes and 3 teachers per class, the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120. Since each teacher plants two trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Now, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers to get the total number of trees planted. The total number of trees planted is 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1240}$"
"To determine the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has and then find 30% of that total.

The total number of stuffed animals is the sum of the number of each type: 3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14.

To find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals, we can multiply the total by 0.30.

Let x be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. We can set up the equation:

(14 + x) * 0.30 = 0.30(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

4.2 + 0.30x = 4.2 + 0.30x

Subtracting 4.2 from both sides gives us:

0 = 0

This equation is true for any value of x, which means that the number of stuffed goats Bubbles buys can be any value. However, since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we can round up to the nearest whole number.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To calculate the total hours Kris has played, we can break down her gaming sessions into two distinct periods. 

First, let's calculate the hours she played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks consist of 14 days. Kris played for 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes) each day. 

Total hours played in the first 2 weeks = 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours

Next, we'll calculate the hours she played in the last week. Kris played for 2 hours each day for 7 days. 

Total hours played in the last week = 2 * 7 = 14 hours

Now, we can find the total hours she has played so far by adding the hours from both periods. 

Total hours played = 7 + 14 = 21 hours

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. 

Hours still needed to play = 30 - 21 = 9 hours

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we can apply the concept of relative motion. Since the second car is traveling at a higher speed, it will cover more ground in the same time frame. 

Let's denote the distance traveled by the first car as d1 and the distance traveled by the second car as d2. We know that d1 = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles and d2 = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles.

The distance between the two cars is the difference between the distances they traveled, which can be calculated as d2 - d1. 

d2 - d1 = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Therefore, the distance between the two cars after 2 hours is 20 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the ring, we need to determine the cost of the premium and add it to the total cost of the diamond and gold.

The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900. The premium is 30% of this total cost. To find 30% of $900, we can multiply $900 by 0.3.

$900 * 0.3 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the ring.

$900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To determine the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The total number of students who passed is the sum of the students who passed in each grade level: 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460.

The total number of students in the school is the sum of the students in each grade level: 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate using the formula: (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100.

Overall pass rate = (460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

Therefore, the overall pass rate is 46%."
"To determine the length of the mosaic, we must first calculate the total number of square inches that can be created with the available glass chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, we can calculate the total number of square inches as follows:

Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips
Total square inches = Total chips / 12 chips/square inch = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is to be 3 inches tall, we can calculate the length of the mosaic by multiplying the number of square inches by the height:

Length = 12 square inches * 3 inches = 36 inches

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 36 inches long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the initial amount of tea, we must first calculate the total amount consumed. Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts. Additionally, 16 students drank 2 quarts each, resulting in 16 x 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is the sum of these two quantities: 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

To find the initial amount of tea, we add the remaining quarts to the total consumed: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts). Therefore, 48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of candies Dale still needs to sell, we must consider the total number of candies he has and the number he has already sold.

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He then ordered an additional 100, bringing his total to 100 + 100 = 200 candies. However, he sold 150 candies, leaving him with 200 - 150 = 50 candies.

To find the number of candies Dale still needs to sell, we can subtract the number he has left from the total number he has. This can be represented as 200 - 50.

200 - 50 = 150

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 150 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"The problem at hand involves exponential growth, where the number of students doubles at the end of every month. This is a classic example of a geometric progression. To calculate the number of additional students by the end of May, we can use the formula for exponential growth:

A = P * (2^n)

where:
- A is the amount after n periods (months in this case)
- P is the initial amount (10 students at the beginning of the year)
- n is the number of periods (5 months from January to May)

We can calculate the number of students at the end of May as follows:

A = 10 * (2^5)
A = 10 * 32
A = 320

To find the additional students, we subtract the initial number from the total:
Additional students = 320 - 10
Additional students = 310

Therefore, the number of additional students by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we can utilize the concept of division. Given that Felix made $105 in a week and charges $0.25 per branch, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch.

Total earnings = $105
Cost per branch = $0.25

Total branches = Total earnings / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by 7.

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

Therefore, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."
"To calculate the total number of petals in the vase, we can employ the principle of arithmetic summation. Let's break down the problem into individual components:

First, we'll calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 × 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 × 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 × 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 × 7 = 42 petals

Now, we'll add the total number of petals for each type of flower: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower. To simplify the calculation, we can use the distributive property of multiplication over addition:

- 1 × (5 + 6 + 4 + 7) = 1 × 22 = 22 petals

Now, let's subtract the dropped petals from the total:
101 - 22 = 79 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have, we need to consider the total number of marshmallows available and the number of S'mores already made.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Total marshmallows = 35
2. Marshmallows dropped = 3
3. Marshmallows left = 35 - 3 = 32

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the total number of S'mores they can make is equal to the number of marshmallows left: 32.

However, we need to consider the number of S'mores already made by both John and DeSean. They made a total of 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to subtract the number of S'mores already made from the total number of S'mores they can make, and then divide the result by 2.

Number of S'mores left = 32 - 18 = 14
Number of S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

Therefore, John and DeSean can each have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total cost of the games played, we need to calculate the time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Let's break down the time each person played:

- Jack plays for 4 hours, which is equivalent to 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes per quarter, he will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.
- The friend who is significantly worse plays for half the time, so they play for 120 minutes. This person will use 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.
- The other friend also plays for 120 minutes, so they will use 6 quarters.
- The better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 1.5 * 240 = 360 minutes. This person will use 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

Now, let's add up the quarters used by each person: 12 + 6 + 6 + 18 = 42 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total cost is 42 * $0.25 = $10.50.

The final answer is: $10.50"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a systematic approach to isolate the variable representing the amount of oil used. Let's denote the amount of salt as 's', the amount of citrus zest as 'z', the amount of fragrance as 'f', and the amount of oil as 'o'.

Given that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, we can express this as z = f. Additionally, since she uses twice as much oil as salt, we have o = 2s. Lastly, the amount of salt is equal to the amount of citrus zest, so s = z.

Substituting z = f and s = z into the equation o = 2s, we get o = 2z. Since z = f, we can rewrite this as o = 2f.

Now, we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, which is the sum of the amounts of salt, citrus zest, fragrance, and oil. Therefore, we can write the equation: s + z + f + o = 10.

Substituting s = z and o = 2z into the equation, we get z + z + f + 2z = 10. Combining like terms, we have 4z + f = 10.

Since z = f, we can substitute f = z into the equation, resulting in 4z + z = 10. Simplifying, we get 5z = 10.

Dividing both sides by 5, we find that z = 2. Now that we know z, we can find the amount of oil used, which is o = 2z. Substituting z = 2, we get o = 2 * 2 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money John spent, we can utilize the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

First, we'll calculate the cost of the goats: 3 goats at $500 each is equivalent to 3 × $500 = $1500.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the cows: 2 cows at $1500 each is equivalent to 2 × $1500 = $3000.

Now, we'll add the costs of the goats and cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is $4500."
"To determine the number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

Let's calculate the difference between the total number of cupcakes required and the number of cupcakes Paul already possesses.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already has = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already has
= 63 - 48
= 15

Therefore, Paul needs to acquire 15 more cupcakes to meet the required quantity."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps using algebraic expressions.

Let's denote the number of cars Joe has as 'x'. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, we can express this as:

x = 2 * 20
x = 40

Now, Joe sells 20% of his cars, which can be represented as 0.2x. We can calculate the number of cars sold as:

Number of cars sold = 0.2x
= 0.2 * 40
= 8

After selling 8 cars, Joe is left with:

x - 0.2x
= 0.8x
= 0.8 * 40
= 32

Next, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

The number of cars Joe has left after giving away 16 cars can be calculated as:

0.8x - 16
= 0.8 * 40 - 16
= 32 - 16
= 16

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount each student raised, we can employ a straightforward division operation. 

The charity raised a total of $175,000, with $50,000 coming from organizations. This leaves $125,000 to be divided among the 20 students. 

The amount each student raised can be calculated as follows:

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Therefore, each student raised $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we must first determine the time she spent walking on the second day. Since she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day, we can calculate this as follows:

Time walked on the first day = 8 hours
Time walked on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

The total time walked in two days is the sum of these two values:

Total time = 8 + 4 = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):

Total time in minutes = 12 * 60 = 720 minutes

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote the initial number of cars as x. We know that x + 20 represents the total number of cars after the first break. Then, half of this number, or (1/2)(x + 20), represents the number of cars that left during the lunch break. The remaining number of cars is the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x + 20 - (1/2)(x + 20) = number of cars counted during lunch break

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 20 - (1/2)x - 10 = number of cars counted during lunch break

Combine like terms:

(1/2)x + 10 = number of cars counted during lunch break

To isolate the term with the variable, we can multiply both sides by 2:

x + 20 - (1/2)x - 10 = 2 * ((1/2)x + 10)

x + 20 - (1/2)x - 10 = x + 20

Now, we can simplify the equation by combining like terms:

(1/2)x + 10 = x + 20

Subtract x from both sides:

(1/2)x - x + 10 = 20

Combine like terms:

-1/2x + 10 = 20

Subtract 10 from both sides:

-1/2x = 10

Multiply both sides by -2:

x = -20

However, this is not the correct answer, as the number of cars cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the equation.

We can re-examine the original equation:

x + 20 - (1/2)(x + 20) = number of cars counted during lunch break

Simplify the equation:

x + 20 - (1/2)x - 10 = number of cars counted during lunch break

Combine like terms:

(1/2)x + 10 = number of cars counted during lunch break

We know that the number of cars counted during the lunch break is equal to the initial number of cars plus the number of cars that arrived during the first break minus the number of cars that left during the lunch break. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x + 20 - (1/2)(x + 20) = x + 20 - (1/2)(x + 20)

Simplify the equation:

x + 20 - (1/2)x - 10 = x + 20 - (1/2)x - 10

Combine like terms:

(1/2)x + 10 = x + 20 - (1/2)x - 10

(1/2)x + 10 = (1/2)x + 10

Subtract (1/2)x from both sides:

10 = 10

This equation is true for all values of x. However, we know that the number of cars counted during the lunch break is equal to the initial number of cars plus the number of cars that arrived during the first break minus the number of cars that left during the lunch break. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

number of cars counted during lunch break = x + 20 - (1/2)(x + 20)

Simplify the equation:

number of cars counted during lunch break = (1/2)x + 10

We know that the number of cars counted during the lunch break is equal to 35. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

(1/2)x + 10 = 35

Subtract 10 from both sides:

(1/2)x = 25

Multiply both sides by 2:

x = 50

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of cars counted during the lunch break:

number of cars counted during lunch break = (1/2)x + 10
= (1/2)(50) + 10
= 25 + 10
= 35

The correct answer is 35."
"To calculate John's weekly earnings, we can employ the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

First, we need to determine the total number of tasks completed in a week. Since John completes 30 cycles of work per day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total number of cycles as follows:

30 cycles/day × 7 days/week = 210 cycles/week

Each cycle consists of 5 tasks, so the total number of tasks completed in a week is:

210 cycles/week × 5 tasks/cycle = 1050 tasks/week

Given that each task pays $1.20, we can calculate John's weekly earnings as follows:

1050 tasks/week × $1.20/task = $1260/week

Therefore, John's weekly earnings are $1260."
"To determine Sasha's total points, we must analyze the information provided. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points, which is a straightforward calculation.

In the second game, we know that Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, we can calculate Julie's score as 14 - 4 = 10 points. Then, we subtract 6 from Julie's score to find Sasha's points in the second game: 10 - 6 = 4 points.

Now, we can calculate Sasha's total points by adding the points from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we can calculate the total tins of each type of food and then find the difference.

The total number of tins of cat food is 8 packages multiplied by 11 tins per package, which equals 88 tins. 

The total number of tins of dog food is 6 packages multiplied by 6 tins per package, which equals 36 tins.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

Final Answer: The final answer is: $\boxed{52}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's represent the number of cards each person has using variables.

Let x be the number of cards PJ has. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides yields:

7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7 results in:

x = 47

Now that we have found PJ's card count, we can determine Becca's card count by substituting x into the equation for Becca's cards:

Becca's cards = 3x + 12
= 3(47) + 12
= 141 + 12
= 153

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{153}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we can break down the information provided and apply basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the number of green eggs as G, blue eggs as B, pink eggs as P, and yellow eggs as Y. We are given the following relationships:

1. G = 5
2. B = 2G
3. P = B - 1
4. Y = P / 3

We can substitute the given values into these equations to find the number of each color of eggs.

First, we find the number of blue eggs:
B = 2G
B = 2(5)
B = 10

Next, we find the number of pink eggs:
P = B - 1
P = 10 - 1
P = 9

Then, we find the number of yellow eggs:
Y = P / 3
Y = 9 / 3
Y = 3

Now, we can find the total number of eggs by adding the number of each color:
Total = G + B + P + Y
Total = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3
Total = 27

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To calculate the amount Milly will lose, we need to consider the cost of shipping and the refund she will receive.

The cost of shipping the book is calculated as follows:
Weight-based shipping cost: 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
Mileage-based shipping cost: 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

The refund Milly will receive is 75% of the book's purchase price:
$32 * 0.75 = $24

Since Milly will have to pay the shipping cost, we subtract the refund from the total cost of the book:
$32 (book cost) - $24 (refund) = $8

Therefore, Milly will lose $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the amount of money Mulan has left, we must first calculate the total amount she spent. She purchased two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which amounts to 2 x $30 = $60. Additionally, she bought a bag for $20. The total amount spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

Therefore, Mulan has $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the production for the fourth week, we must first calculate the total production for the first three weeks. 

The production for the first week is 8,000 bars. The second week's production is half of the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. The third week's production is three times the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, we can find the total production for the first three weeks by adding these values: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we can find the production for the fourth week by subtracting the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The final answer is 14,000."
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to consider the time she dedicates to creating content and preparing for her videos.

First, let's calculate the total time spent on content creation: 18 videos/week * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes/week. Converting this to hours, we get 72 minutes / 60 = 1.2 hours/week.

Next, we calculate the time spent on makeup: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week. Converting this to hours, we get 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours/week.

Now, we add the time spent on content creation and makeup: 1.2 hours/week + 1.5 hours/week = 2.7 hours/week.

To find the total time spent on TikTok in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 2.7 hours/week * 4 weeks = 10.8 hours.

The final answer is: 10.8"
"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the items into standard and additional items. The standard items are: 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of these standard items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. To find the cost of the additional items, we subtract the standard quantities from the quantities Angela has:

- Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors
- Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier
- Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures

The cost of the additional items is calculated as follows:

- Additional mirrors: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
- Additional chandeliers: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
- Additional pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost for Angela is the sum of the standard items and the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324."
"To determine Roy's savings, we can break down the information provided. Let's start by finding Anthony's savings. Since Anthony has $10 more than Eva, and Eva has $20, we can express this as:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10
Anthony's savings = $20 + $10
Anthony's savings = $30

Now, we know Roy has 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we can use the formula:

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.4 * Anthony's savings
= 0.4 * $30
= $12

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings:

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
= $30 + $12
= $42

Therefore, Roy has $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a series of steps, utilizing the given information to calculate the height Naruto can lift.

First, we establish the relationship between the heights each individual can lift. We know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, who can lift 1 inch. Therefore, Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Next, we determine the height Kagiyami can lift, which is 4 times the height Saskay can lift. This results in 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Lastly, we calculate the height Naruto can lift, which is 10 times the height Kagiyami can lift. This yields 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert the height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). Therefore, Naruto can lift 480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To calculate the total distance traveled by Mason, we can apply the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time. In this case, we have two segments of travel.

First, we calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours:
Distance = Speed × Time
= 8 miles/hour × 4 hours
= 32 miles

Next, we calculate the distance covered in the next 6 hours:
Distance = Speed × Time
= 8 miles/hour × 6 hours
= 48 miles

Now, we add the distances covered in both segments to find the total distance:
Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
= 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we can apply the concept of proportional reasoning and rates. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the rate at which the kangaroos are traveling. Since 3 kangaroos can cover the distance in 18 hours, we can find the rate as follows:

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1 / 18 (since we're considering the rate per kangaroo)

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, the rate at which the turtles are traveling is:

Rate of turtles = Rate of kangaroo / 2
Rate of turtles = (1 / 18) / 2
Rate of turtles = 1 / 36

Since the distance remains the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can set up a proportion to find the time it will take for the turtles to cover the same distance:

Time for turtles = Distance / Rate of turtles
Time for turtles = 1 / (1 / 36)
Time for turtles = 36 hours

Therefore, it will take the four turtles 36 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic expressions to represent the number of dishes each person made. Let's denote the number of dishes Kora made as 'x'. Since Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, we can express Rory's dishes as x + 20. Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada's dishes can be represented as 2(x + 20).

We are given that Kora made 20 dishes, so x = 20. Now, we can substitute this value into the expressions for Rory and Jada's dishes:

Rory's dishes = x + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
Jada's dishes = 2(x + 20) = 2(20 + 20) = 2(40) = 80

To find the total number of dishes, we add the number of dishes made by each person:

Total number of dishes = Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes
= 20 + 40 + 80
= 140

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora is 140.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we can analyze the given information and apply basic arithmetic principles.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The original price of the laptop is $600. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, resulting in a new price of $600 - $200 = $400.
2. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and received $80 from her mom, which adds to her initial savings. Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as x. We can express this as x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50.

Now, we can solve for x by simplifying the equation:

x + 230 = 350

Subtracting 230 from both sides:

x = 350 - 230

x = 120

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

Final Answer: The final answer is $120."
"To determine the number of apple slices left, we must first calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples separately.

The number of slices from 3 large apples is 3 x 5 = 15.
The number of slices from 5 small apples is 5 x 3 = 15.

The total number of slices is the sum of these two quantities: 15 + 15 = 30.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can use a simple division problem. 

Let's denote the number of cows needed as 'x'. Since the farmer currently has 3 cows, producing 5 liters of milk per cow, we can set up the following equation:

5x = 25

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 25 / 5
x = 5

This means the farmer needs 5 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Final answer: 5"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of each glue stick that is not used and add them together.

Let's analyze each glue stick separately:

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which means it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the unused portion, we can subtract the fraction of the used portion from 1: 1 - 5/6 = 1/6. Multiplying this by the original length of the glue stick (12 mm), we get (1/6) × 12 mm = 2 mm.

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which means it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the unused portion, we can subtract the fraction of the used portion from 1: 1 - 1/3 = 2/3. Multiplying this by the original length of the glue stick (12 mm), we get (2/3) × 12 mm = 8 mm.

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which means it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the unused portion, we can subtract the fraction of the used portion from 1: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. Multiplying this by the original length of the glue stick (12 mm), we get (1/2) × 12 mm = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are not used: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 mm."
"To determine the amount Gabriel still needs, we can apply basic arithmetic principles. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the items: $10,000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10,800.

Next, we calculate the total amount Gabriel has: $5,000 (from working) + $200 (from his brother) = $5,200.

Now, we subtract the amount Gabriel has from the total cost to find the amount he still needs: $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600."
"To calculate the change Thea received, we can apply the concept of subtraction. 

The total amount she paid is $80, which is equivalent to 4 * $20. The cost of the hat is $70. 

Change = Total amount paid - Cost of the hat
Change = $80 - $70
Change = $10

Therefore, Thea received $10 in change."
"To determine Craig's remaining funds, we must first calculate the total amount spent on the squirt guns and water balloons. 

Craig purchased 6 squirt guns at $2 each, resulting in a total cost of 6 × $2 = $12. He also purchased 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each, resulting in a total cost of 3 × $3 = $9.

The total amount spent is the sum of these two costs: $12 + $9 = $21.

Craig initially had 2 twenty-dollar bills, which equals 2 × $20 = $40. To find the remaining amount, we subtract the total spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Therefore, Craig has $19 left.

19"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of socks Peter has as P and the number of dishes Jack has as J.

From the problem statement, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so we can write an equation:
P = 2J

We are also given that Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so we can write another equation:
J = 2P

Now, we are told that Jack collected 60 dishes, so we can substitute J = 60 into the second equation:
60 = 2P

To solve for P, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:
P = 60 / 2
P = 30

Now that we know Peter has 30 socks, we can find the number of dishes Peter has by substituting P = 30 into the first equation:
J = 2P
J = 2(30)
J = 60

Now that we know both Peter and Jack have 30 socks and 60 dishes, respectively, we can find the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total = P + J
Total = 30 + 60
Total = 90

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90."
"In set theory, we can approach this problem by utilizing the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's denote the set of students good at math as M and the set of students good at English as E. We are given:

|M| = 5 (number of students good at math only)
|E| = 8 (number of students good at English only)
|M ∪ E| = 20 (total number of students)

We want to find |M ∪ E|, which represents the total number of students good at either math or English or both. However, we are not directly given |M ∩ E|, the number of students good at both subjects.

To find |M ∪ E|, we can use the formula:

|M ∪ E| = |M| + |E| - |M ∩ E|

Since we don't know |M ∩ E|, we can rearrange the formula to solve for it:

|M ∩ E| = |M| + |E| - |M ∪ E|

Substituting the given values:

|M ∩ E| = 5 + 8 - 20
|M ∩ E| = 13

Now that we know |M ∩ E|, we can find |M|, which represents the total number of students good at math:

|M| = |M| + |M ∩ E|
|M| = 5 + 13
|M| = 18

Therefore, the total number of students good at math is 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to consider the total available time and the time required for each group's performance.

The total time of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. We also need to account for a 10-minute intermission. Therefore, the total available time for performances is:

Total available time = 120 minutes - 10 minutes (intermission) = 110 minutes

Each group requires 10 minutes for their performance. To find the number of groups that can perform, we can divide the total available time by the time required for each group:

Number of groups = Total available time ÷ Time required per group
= 110 minutes ÷ 10 minutes
= 11

Therefore, Vicki can accommodate 11 groups in the concert.

Final answer: $\boxed{11}$"
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we can utilize the formula for simple interest:

A = P(1 + rt)

where:
A = total amount
P = principal amount ($300)
r = annual interest rate (3/4 or 0.75 as a decimal)
t = time in years (3)

First, we'll calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

Year 1: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225, Total = P + Interest = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Interest = P * r = $525 * 0.75 = $393.75, Total = $525 + $393.75 = $918.75
Year 3: Interest = P * r = $918.75 * 0.75 = $693.5625, Total = $918.75 + $693.5625 = $1612.3125

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $1612.31.

The final answer is $1612.31."
"To determine the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars, we can apply set theory principles.

Let's denote the set of white shirts as W and the set of floral shirts as F. We know that |W| = 40 and |F| = 50. We also know that half of the white shirts have collars, so |W ∩ C| = |W| / 2 = 20, where C represents the set of shirts with collars. Similarly, we know that 20 floral shirts have buttons, so |F ∩ B| = 20, where B represents the set of shirts with buttons.

To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion: |F ∪ B| = |F| + |B| - |F ∩ B|. Since we're interested in the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we need to find |F - B|, which is equivalent to |F| - |F ∩ B| = 50 - 20 = 30.

To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we can use the same principle: |W - C| = |W| - |W ∩ C| = 40 - 20 = 20.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars: |F - B| - |W - C| = 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total earnings, we can use the formula:

Total Earnings = Number of Trays * Price per Tray

Given:
Number of Eggs = 900
Eggs per Tray = 30
Price per Tray = $2.5

First, we calculate the number of trays:
Number of Trays = Total Eggs / Eggs per Tray
= 900 / 30
= 30

Now, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:
Total Earnings = Number of Trays * Price per Tray

The farmer will earn $75."
"To determine the total number of goats left in the two farms, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we'll calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sales. 

The initial number of goats in Farm X is 55, and 10 goats were sold, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

Since Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, the number of goats sold from Farm Y is 2 * 10 = 20. Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, we can find the total number of goats left in both farms by adding the number of goats left in each farm: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."
"To determine the average cost of each pair of shoes, we can utilize the formula for calculating average value, which is the total value divided by the number of items. In this scenario, the total value is $2640, and the number of items (pairs of shoes) is 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

Average cost per pair = Total amount spent per year / Number of pairs bought per year
= $2640 / 12
= $220

Therefore, James pays an average of $220 for each pair of shoes."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the cost of 3 baskets of green food and the discounted cost of 3 baskets of red food.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

For the red food, we have a discount of $2 per basket. So, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6. The discounted cost of 3 baskets of red food is $18 - $6 = $12.

Now, we add the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food: $75 + $12 = $87.

Therefore, the total cost is $87.

The final answer is: $87"
"To determine the time required to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we need to calculate the number of rooms that is one-half of 90, which is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms. 

Next, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room, which is 45 * 20 minutes. 

To convert the result to hours, we divide by 60, yielding 45 * 20 / 60 = 7.5 hours.

Therefore, it would take 7.5 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

Final answer: $\boxed{7.5}$"
"To calculate the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break down the problem into three parts.

First, we need to find the number of homes built in the first year, which is given as 12.

Next, we calculate the number of homes built in the second year, which is three times the number built in the first year: 3 * 12 = 36.

Then, we double the total number of homes built in the first two years to find the number built in the third year: 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96.

Now, we add the number of homes built in each year to find the total: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

Therefore, the total number of homes built over the next three years is 144.

The final answer is: $\boxed{144}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:

- Your age: x
- Your brother's age: x + 3
- Your sister's age: x - 2
- Your mom's age: 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8

The sum of your ages is 87, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87

Combine like terms:

5x + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides:

5x = 78

Divide by 5:

x = 15.6

However, since age cannot be a fraction, we can round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can express the solution as an exact fraction to maintain precision.

x = 78/5

x = 15.6 can be expressed as a fraction, but since the question does not explicitly ask for a decimal, we can leave the answer as a fraction.

The final answer is 78/5."
"To determine the number of packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can use the division operation. 

Let's perform the calculation: 

Number of students = 27
Number of glue sticks per pack = 8

Total glue sticks required = Number of students × Number of glue sticks per pack
= 27 × 2
= 54

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we can divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find the number of packs needed:

Number of packs = Total glue sticks required ÷ Number of glue sticks per pack
= 54 ÷ 8
= 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The correct answer is: D"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total amount of water passing through a river over three consecutive days. To approach this, we can utilize the concept of exponential growth, as the amount of water doubles each day.

Let's denote the initial amount of water as A. On the first day, the amount of water is 4000 gallons. On the second day, it doubles to 2A, which equals 8000 gallons. On the third day, it increases by 6000 gallons, resulting in a total of 2A + 6000.

To find the value of A, we can set up the equation: 2A + 6000 = 2(4000). Solving for A, we get A = 4000. Now that we know the initial amount, we can calculate the total amount of water on the third day: 2A + 6000 = 2(4000) + 6000 = 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

Final answer: $\boxed{14000}$"
"The exponential growth of the plague outbreak can be modeled using the formula for exponential growth: N(t) = N0 * (r^t), where N0 is the initial number of infected individuals, r is the growth rate, and t is the time in days.

In this scenario, N0 = 10 (initially, 10 people are infected) and r = 6 (each infected person infects 6 others). We need to find N(3), the total number of infected people after 3 days.

Using the formula, we get: N(3) = 10 * (6^3) = 10 * 216 = 2160.

Therefore, the total number of people infected after 3 days is 2160.

The final answer is: $oxed{2160}$"
"To calculate the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we can use the concept of percentages. 

First, we need to find 10% of Rafaela's tips, which is $800 * 0.1 = $80. Since Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips: $800 - $80 = $720.

Now, we add the tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela: $720 + $800 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To determine the number of oranges Jennifer remained with, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of oranges given away: 3 daughters received 2 oranges each, and 1 son received 3 oranges. This results in a total of 6 + 3 = 9 oranges given away.

Now, we subtract the total oranges given away from the initial number of oranges purchased: 12 - 9 = 3.

Therefore, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire, so she earns 3 badges per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 3 = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To calculate the total amount raised, we need to consider the number of slices sold and the price per slice. Since Paige baked 2 loaves per hour and each loaf is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices sold can be calculated as follows:

Number of slices = 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves
Number of slices = 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices

Since each slice is sold for 50 cents, we can calculate the total amount raised as follows:

Total amount raised = Number of slices * Price per slice
Total amount raised = 80 slices * $0.50/slice
Total amount raised = $40

Therefore, Paige raised $40 in the fundraiser."
"To determine the total number of coins Gretchen had, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. Given that the number of gold coins is 70, we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

Solving for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

Now that we have determined the number of silver coins to be 40, we can calculate the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver)
Total coins = 110

Therefore, Gretchen had a total of 110 coins."
"To calculate the total number of leftover burritos, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to determine the total number of burritos distributed to the students. Since there are 50 students and each student received 10 burritos, we can calculate this as follows:

Total burritos given to students = Number of students * Number of burritos per student
Total burritos given to students = 50 * 10
Total burritos given to students = 500

Next, we need to account for the burritos consumed by Mr. George. We are given that he ate 20 burritos. To find the total number of leftover burritos, we subtract the number of burritos eaten from the total number of burritos given to the students:

Total leftover burritos = Total burritos given to students - Total burritos eaten
Total leftover burritos = 500 - 20
Total leftover burritos = 480

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos is 480."
"To determine the number of yellow cars, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of yellow cars as y.

We know that the total number of cars is 75. The number of red cars is 12, the number of green cars is 10 (2 fewer than the number of red cars), and the number of blue cars is 30 (3 times the number of green cars). We can express this as:

12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) + y (yellow) = 75

Simplifying the equation, we get:

52 + y = 75

Subtracting 52 from both sides, we get:

y = 23

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's represent the number of books each person has with variables: Fawn (x), Anne (y), and Sofie (z).

We are given two key pieces of information:

1. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne: z = y + 25
2. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn: y = x - 12

We also know that together, they have 85 books: z + y + x = 85

We can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to eliminate variables:

(y + 25) + y + x = 85

Combine like terms:

2y + x + 25 = 85

Subtract 25 from both sides:

2y + x = 60

Now, substitute y = x - 12 into the equation:

2(x - 12) + x = 60

Expand the equation:

2x - 24 + x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x - 24 = 60

Add 24 to both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To determine the weight of the carrots, we must first calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, we can express this as a mathematical equation:

Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 × Weight of potatoes
Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 × 5
Weight of sweet potatoes = 10 pounds

Now, we can calculate the weight of the carrots, which is 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes:

Weight of carrots = Weight of sweet potatoes - 3
Weight of carrots = 10 - 3
Weight of carrots = 7 pounds

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"To determine the total cost of the jello, we can employ a straightforward proportional reasoning approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of cups required. With 30 kids and 4 cups per kid, the total number of cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120 cups.

Since each 3-ounce box yields 10 cups, we can find the number of boxes required by dividing the total cups needed by 10. This results in 120 / 10 = 12 boxes.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes needed by the price per box. The total cost is 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To calculate the change, we need to subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given. 

The total cost of the phones is $700 per phone multiplied by the number of phones, which is 5. 

$700 * 5 = $3500

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount given: 

$4000 - $3500 = $500

Therefore, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To determine Keenan's weekly expenditure, we must first calculate his monthly expenditure. Given that Madeline pays 60% of the total $400, we can find Keenan's share by multiplying the total cost by 0.4 (which represents 40% of the total).

Keenan's monthly expenditure = 0.4 * $400 = $160

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can find Keenan's weekly expenditure by dividing his monthly expenditure by 4.

Keenan's weekly expenditure = $160 / 4 = $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

The final answer is $40."
"To determine the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he consumed each day.

First, let's find 2/5 of 60 pieces, which represents the number of pieces eaten on the first day. We can calculate this as follows:

(2/5) × 60 = (2 × 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces. Now, let's find the number of pieces remaining after the first two days:

60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces

Next, we need to calculate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces, which represents the number of pieces eaten on the third day. We can calculate this as follows:

(7/13) × 26 = (7 × 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces

Now, let's add up the pieces eaten each day:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

The final answer is 48."
"To calculate the total cost of the items David wants to purchase, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the soda and the cost of the water.

The cost of 3 bottles of soda can be calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the cost per bottle: 3 * $21.00 = $63.00.

Similarly, the cost of 2 bottles of water can be calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the cost per bottle: 2 * $8.00 = $16.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the soda and the cost of the water: $63.00 + $16.00 = $79.00.

Therefore, the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $79.00."
"To calculate the remaining amount of money David has after purchasing the bolts, we can employ the concept of subtraction. 

The total cost of the bolts is $0.48, and David initially had $12.48. To find the remaining amount, we subtract the cost from the initial amount:

$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts.

Final Answer: The final answer is $12.00."
"To determine Ella's earnings after 12 hours of dog walking, we must first calculate her hourly rate. This can be achieved by dividing her total earnings by the number of hours worked: $33 ÷ 3 hours = $11 per hour.

Now, we can multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she will work to find her total earnings: $11 per hour * 12 hours = $132.

Therefore, Ella's total earnings after 12 hours of dog walking will be $132."
"To determine the number of marbles Paul has left, we can follow a step-by-step approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after receiving 28 marbles from his friend. This can be done by adding 28 to the initial 52 marbles: 52 + 28 = 80.

Next, we need to find 1/4 of the total number of marbles Paul has. This can be calculated as 1/4 * 80 = 20.

Now, we subtract the number of marbles lost (20) from the total number of marbles Paul has (80) to find the number of marbles he has left: 80 - 20 = 60.

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To calculate Amy's total score, we need to consider the weighted average of her performance across the different types of questions.

First, let's calculate the points from each type of question:

Multiple-choice questions: 80% of 10 questions = 0.8 * 10 = 8 points
True/false questions: 90% of 20 questions = 0.9 * 20 = 18 points
Long-answer questions: 60% of 5 questions = 0.6 * 5 = 3 points

Since multiple-choice and true/false questions are worth 1 point each, we can calculate the total points from these questions as follows:

Multiple-choice and true/false questions: 8 + 18 = 26 points

Now, we add the points from the long-answer questions to get the total score:

Total points = 26 + 3 = 29 points

Therefore, Amy scores 29 points on the test."
"To determine the cost at which Isaias bought the chickens, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote the cost per chicken as x. Since Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, the number of chickens sold is (3/5) * 300 = 180.

The total revenue from selling 180 chickens at $50 each is 180 * 50 = $9000. Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, so the total cost of the chickens must be $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

Now, we can set up the equation: 180x = 7000, where x is the cost per chicken.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 180: x = 7000 / 180.

x = 38.89

The final answer is: $38.89"
"To determine the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah, we can use the concept of division and subtraction.

Given that Julie sold 14 glasses and the total number of glasses sold is 32, we can find the number of glasses sold by Micah by dividing the total number of glasses by 3.

Let's denote the number of glasses sold by Micah as x. Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can set up the equation:

x + 14 = 32

Subtracting 14 from both sides gives us:

x = 18

Now that we know Micah sold 18 glasses, we can find the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah:

Difference = Julie's sales - Micah's sales
= 14 - 18
= -4

However, since we are looking for the difference in the number of glasses sold, we can take the absolute value of the result:

Difference = | -4 |
= 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we can break down the costs of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which can be calculated as:

$400 * (1/4) = $400 * 0.25 = $100

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which can be calculated as:

$100 * (3/4) = $100 * 0.75 = $75

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

Therefore, the total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To determine the amount of money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we can calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The cost of the new rope is 20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30. 

Sarah has the rope for $2 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so she has 20 meters * $2/meter = $40.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount Sarah has:
$40 - $30 = $10

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

Final answer: $10"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's denote Melanie's present age as 'x'. Since she will be 18 in 10 years, we can write the equation:

x + 10 = 18

Solving for x, we get:

x = 18 - 10
x = 8

Now, we need to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age. Let's denote this number of years as 'y'. We can set up the equation:

x + y = 3x

Substituting x = 8, we get:

8 + y = 3(8)
8 + y = 24

Solving for y, we get:

y = 24 - 8
y = 16

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:
- 5 packs of bacon at $10 per pack is 5 × $10 = $50.
- 6 packets of chicken at twice the price of a pack of bacon is 6 × 2 × $10 = $120.
- 3 packs of strawberries at $4 per pack is 3 × $4 = $12.
- 7 packs of apples at half the price of a pack of strawberries is 7 × $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$50 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $196.

However, Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
$65 - $196 = -$131.

Since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this indicates that Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to purchase all the items."
"To determine the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the length of her usual concert as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x. We also know that the final concert includes a 15-minute encore, so the total runtime is 2x + 15. We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we can subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate x:

x = 50/2
x = 25

Therefore, the length of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the number of toys Argo has now, we can apply the principle of subtraction. We start with the initial number of toys and subtract the total number of toys given away.

Initial number of toys = 200
Toys given away = 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Number of toys Argo has now = Initial number of toys - Toys given away
= 200 - 150
= 50

Therefore, Argo has 50 toys now."
"To determine the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we can employ the principle of arithmetic summation. 

Let's break down the information provided:

- On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the shop makes 125 chimichangas each day, resulting in a combined total of 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas.

- On Fridays, the shop makes twice as many chimichangas, which equates to 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we can calculate the total number of chimichangas made on those three days by adding the totals from each day: 250 + 250 = 500 chimichangas.

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To determine the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we can calculate the percentage of microphones that were successfully paired.

First, we need to find 20% of 50, which represents the number of microphones that won't fit in pairs. This can be calculated as:

(20/100) * 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Since microphones come in pairs, we can assume that each pair consists of 2 microphones. To find the number of microphones that were able to fit in pairs, we subtract the number of microphones that won't fit from the total number of microphones:

50 - 10 = 40

Now, we can find the number of pairs by dividing the number of microphones that fit by 2:

40 / 2 = 20

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final answer is 20."
"To calculate the total number of birds, we can break down the problem into three distinct components: birds in the bushes, birds flying overhead, and birds feeding.

First, we'll calculate the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds in the bushes are flying overhead, we can express this as a fraction: 2/3 * 6 = 4.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of birds feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we can multiply the number of groups by the number of birds per group: 3 * 8 = 24.

Now, we'll add the number of birds in the bushes, the number of birds flying overhead, and the number of birds feeding to find the total: 6 + 4 + 24 = 34.

Therefore, the total number of birds is 34.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the number of cookies in each jar, we must first calculate the remaining cookies after Lani ate 5 cookies.

Let's denote the initial number of cookies as C and the number of cookies eaten as E. We know that C = 55 and E = 5. The remaining cookies can be calculated as:

C - E = 55 - 5 = 50

Since the remaining cookies are divided equally into 5 jars, we can calculate the number of cookies in each jar by dividing the remaining cookies by 5:

50 ÷ 5 = 10

Therefore, each jar contains 10 cookies.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and orchids, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of petals on the orchids: 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals.

Next, we calculate the total number of petals on the daisies: 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we find the number of indoor plants, which is one-fourth of the total number of plants. This can be calculated as:

(1/4) × 100 = 25

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after removing the indoor plants. This is done by subtracting the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants:

100 - 25 = 75

Now, we find the number of outdoor plants, which is two-thirds of the remaining plants. This can be calculated as:

(2/3) × 75 = 50

Finally, we find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

75 - 50 = 25

To express this as a percentage, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:

(25 / 100) × 100 = 25%

Therefore, 25% of the plants in Mrs. Smith's garden are flowering plants.

The final answer is 25%."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x meters per second. Since a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, the speed of the whatchamacallit can be expressed as 11x.

We are given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we have found the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. Since the whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob, the speed of the whirligig is 5x:

Speed of whirligig = 5x
= 5 * 11
= 55

The final answer is: 55"
"To determine the cost of one carrot, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of one carrot as 'c'. Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, the total cost of carrots is 2c. The cost of the salad is $6, and the cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is $6/2 = $3.

The total cost of Ellen's daily expenses is $11, so we can set up the equation:

2c + 6 + 3 = 11

Combine like terms:

2c + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides:

2c = 2

Divide both sides by 2:

c = 1

Therefore, the cost of one carrot is $1.

$1"
"To calculate Mark's new weekly earnings, we can apply the concept of hourly wage multiplication. Given that his original hourly wage was $10 and it was increased by $2, we can express this as:

New hourly wage = Original hourly wage + Raise
New hourly wage = $10 + $2
New hourly wage = $12

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we can calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the total number of hours worked in a week:

Weekly earnings = New hourly wage * Total hours worked per week
Weekly earnings = $12 * 8 hours/day * 5 days/week
Weekly earnings = $12 * 40 hours/week
Weekly earnings = $480

Therefore, Mark's new weekly earnings are $480."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as x. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80. This gives us the equation:

6x = 80

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 6:

x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now that we know she mowed Joe's lawn 13 times, we can find out how many times she mowed Kamala's and Alba's lawns:

Kamala's lawn: 3x = 3 * 13 = 39 times
Alba's lawn: 5x = 5 * 13 = 65 times

The total amount she earned from mowing lawns is:
6 * 13 + 39 + 65 = 6 * 13 + 104 = 6 * (13 + 17.33) = 6 * 30.33 = 182.98

However, we are asked to find the amount she made from lemonade sales. We know that she made $80 in total and $182.98 from mowing lawns. Therefore, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:

$80 - $182.98 = -$102.98

Since we cannot have a negative amount, there seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement. However, following the instructions, I will provide the numerical value:

The final answer is: $-102.98"
"To determine Harry's weight, we can apply a straightforward arithmetic approach. We are given the following information:

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

Therefore, Harry's weight is 74 kg."
"To calculate John's profit, we must first determine his total monthly earnings from renting his car. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of hours he rents his car per month (10 hours) by his hourly wage ($25). 

Total monthly earnings = 10 hours * $25/hour = $250

Next, we subtract his car payment from his total monthly earnings to find his profit.

Profit = Total monthly earnings - Car payment
Profit = $250 - $500
Profit = -$250

Since profit cannot be negative, we must reevaluate the calculation. It appears that John's car payment exceeds his total monthly earnings. This indicates that John is actually incurring a loss.

The final answer is: -$250"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of notebooks Joseph had initially as x. Since Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, we can express Martha's initial number of notebooks as 3x.

We are also given that Martha bought 5 more notebooks, resulting in a total of 7 notebooks. This can be represented by the equation:

3x + 5 = 7

To solve for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 7 - 5
3x = 2

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate x:

x = 2/3

Now that we have found the initial number of notebooks Joseph had, we can calculate the difference between Martha's and Joseph's current number of notebooks. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 2/3 notebooks. To find the difference, we can subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

7 - (2/3)
= 7 - 2/3
= (21 - 2)/3
= 19/3

To express this as a numerical value, we can divide 19 by 3:

19/3 ≈ 6.33

Therefore, Martha has approximately 6.33 more notebooks than Joseph.

The final answer is: 6.33"
"To calculate the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Given that Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can express this as a ratio:

Anis's distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis's distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis's distance = 50 + 10
Anis's distance = 60

Now, we can calculate the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

Therefore, the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis is 110 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"
"To determine the number of cookies each nephew will receive, we must first account for the cookies taken by Susan's husband. This is a classic example of a subtraction problem, where we need to find the difference between the total number of cookies and the number taken.

Let's denote the total number of cookies as T and the number taken by the husband as H. We are given T = 100 and H = 4. The number of cookies remaining is then T - H.

T - H = 100 - 4
T - H = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies among Susan's 6 nephews. This is a division problem, where we need to find the quotient of the remaining cookies and the number of nephews.

Cookies per nephew = (T - H) / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

Therefore, each nephew will receive 16 cookies."
"To determine the difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel, we can calculate the total pages read by each individual.

Denise read 10 pages yesterday and 18 pages today. To find the difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel, we need to calculate the total pages read by each of them.

Denise's total pages = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages
Daniel's total pages = 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages

The difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel is:
28 - 13 = 15

Therefore, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has and then subtract the bowls that will be eaten for dinner.

Since Calvin has enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of bowls: 4x = 8y, where x is the number of adult bowls and y is the number of child bowls. 

Solving for x, we get x = 2. This means Calvin has 2 bowls of soup. 

Now, we need to subtract the bowls that will be eaten for dinner. There are 4 adults, so 4 bowls will be eaten for dinner. 

2 bowls (total) - 4 bowls (eaten for dinner) = -2 bowls left for lunch.

Since there are 2 children and -2 bowls left, each child will not be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch.

The final answer is: 0"
"To calculate the total cost, we can apply the principle of multiplication to determine the cost of the notebooks and then add the cost of the ballpen.

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each can be calculated as 5 × $1.50 = $7.50.

Adding the cost of the ballpen, which is $0.50, we get:

$7.50 + $0.50 = $8

Therefore, the total amount William spent is $8."
"To determine the total material needed, we must consider the proportional relationship between the number of masks and the material required for each size.

For small masks, the ratio of material to masks is 2 yards per 4 masks. To find the material needed for 20 small masks, we can set up a proportion:

(2 yards / 4 masks) = x yards / 20 masks

Cross-multiplying, we get:
2 * 20 = 4x
40 = 4x
x = 40 / 4
x = 10 yards

For large masks, the ratio of material to masks is 2.25 yards per 3 masks. To find the material needed for 8 large masks, we can set up a proportion:

(2.25 yards / 3 masks) = y yards / 8 masks

Cross-multiplying, we get:
2.25 * 8 = 3y
18 = 3y
y = 18 / 3
y = 6 yards

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks:
Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To calculate the average price per ticket, we can utilize the formula for average, which is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. In this scenario, the total amount spent ($216) is the sum of the individual ticket prices, and the total number of tickets (27) is the number of values.

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 ÷ 27
= $8

Therefore, the average price per ticket is $8."
"To determine Harold's free time, we must first calculate the total hours in a day and then subtract the hours spent on various activities.

The total hours in a day are 24. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours. He also walks his dog for 1 hour.

The total hours spent on these activities are 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours.

Now, subtracting these hours from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of blue and red shoe boxes left, we must first calculate the number of each type of shoe box used. 

The number of blue shoe boxes used is given as 3. To find the number of red shoe boxes used, we calculate 1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes:
(1/3) * 9 = 3

Now, we subtract the number used from the total number of each type of shoe box:
Blue shoe boxes left: 7 - 3 = 4
Red shoe boxes left: 9 - 3 = 6

Therefore, the total number of shoe boxes left is 4 (blue) + 6 (red) = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the number of books Joseph currently has, we can apply a straightforward arithmetic operation. 

First, we need to calculate the initial number of books Joseph had, which is twice the number of books Sarah has. Since Sarah has 9 books, we can express this as:

2 * 9 = 18

Next, we subtract the number of books Joseph lost, which is 2, from the initial number of books he had:

18 - 2 = 16

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To determine the number of marbles Dean has left, we can employ a straightforward approach by first calculating the total marbles given away and then subtracting that from the initial amount.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate 1/5 of 30 (the marbles given to Jamie):

(1/5) × 30 = 6

2. Add the 10 marbles given to Donald:

6 + 10 = 16

3. Subtract the total marbles given away from the initial amount:

30 - 16 = 14

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Adam's current age as 'x'. We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be translated into the equation:

60 - 8 = 2(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

52 = 2x - 8

Adding 8 to both sides yields:

60 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 30

Now that we have Adam's current age, we can determine his age in 8 years by adding 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = x + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

The final answer is: $\boxed{38}$"
"To determine the total number of acres of the two farms, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm, which is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. This can be expressed as 2 * 200 + 100. 

Using the order of operations, we first multiply 2 and 200, resulting in 400. Then, we add 100 to this product, yielding 500 acres for Farmer Smith's farm.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"To determine Colby's daily earnings, we must first calculate the number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday. Since he completes 10 fewer packages than the standard 50 per hour, his hourly rate is 50 - 10 = 40 packages.

Multiplying this rate by the number of hours worked (8) yields 40 * 8 = 320 packages per day.

Given that Colby earns $0.20 for each package, his daily earnings can be calculated as 320 * 0.20 = $64.

Therefore, Colby earns $64 in a typical 8-hour workday.

The final answer is: $64"
"To calculate the total number of bottles of water John drinks, we must first determine the total time spent on sudoku puzzles. 

The time for the normal sudoku puzzle is 45 minutes, and the time for the extreme sudoku puzzle is 4 times that, which equals 180 minutes. 

The total time spent on sudoku puzzles is the sum of these two times: 45 minutes + 180 minutes = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can calculate the number of bottles by dividing the total time by 30 minutes.

Number of bottles of water = Total time / 30 minutes
= 225 minutes / 30 minutes
= 7.5

Therefore, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water in that time."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of red balloons as R and the number of yellow balloons as Y. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons and a total of 58 pieces of bologna.

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown can be represented by the equation:
2R + 3Y = 58

We are also given that R = 20. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:
2(20) + 3Y = 58
40 + 3Y = 58

Now, we can solve for Y by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:
3Y = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
Y = 18/3
Y = 6

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we can utilize the concept of division to calculate the total number of tune-ups required. 

Given that Jon drives 100 miles per day and there are 30 days in the month, the total miles driven can be calculated as:

Total miles = miles driven per day * number of days
Total miles = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total miles = 3000 miles

Since the car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed:

Number of tune-ups = Total miles / 1000
Number of tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000
Number of tune-ups = 3

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To calculate the total hours Bruce works over the three days, we can break down the problem into individual components.

First, we need to determine the hours worked on each day. On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours. On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, we can add the hours worked each day to find the total hours: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the initial amount of allowance given to Julia and Nadine, we must first calculate the total amount spent on the items purchased.

The cost of the cake is $11, and the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 each, totaling $14. Additionally, the cost of 1 dozen balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.

The total amount spent is $11 + $14 + $6 = $31.

Since the girls had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find the initial amount each had.

Let's denote the initial amount of allowance as 'x'. The equation to represent the situation is:

x + x = 31

Combine like terms:

2x = 31

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 31/2

x = 15.5

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50.

15.50"
"To determine the total number of fruits Kira has left, we must first calculate the initial total and then subtract the number of fruits eaten by Lola.

The initial total is the sum of the individual quantities: 3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14.

To find the number of fruits left, we subtract the number eaten by Lola (2) from the initial total: 14 - 2 = 12.

Therefore, Kira has 12 pieces of fruit left.

Final Answer: The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total number of students, we must consider the number of students participating in each sport. 

First, we calculate the number of students playing volleyball, which is twice the number playing tennis. This yields 2 * 6 = 12 students.

Next, we add the number of students playing soccer, which is 16 boys and 22 girls, totaling 38 students.

Now, we sum the number of students in each sport: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56 students.

Therefore, the total number of students is 56.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money raised, we can use the formula:

Total Profit = (Number of Lollipops Sold) * (Selling Price - Cost Price)

Given:
- Number of Lollipops Sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops
- Selling Price = $0.8 per lollipop
- Cost Price = $0.5 per lollipop

Total Profit = 300 lollipops * ($0.8 - $0.5)
= 300 lollipops * $0.3
= $90

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we can break down the information into separate components and calculate each one.

First, we know Larry has 3 cats. Then, we're told he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, which can be expressed as 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Next, we're informed that he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so we subtract 2 from the number of dogs: 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Moving on to the fish, we're told he has three times the number of fish as rabbits, which translates to 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

Lastly, we're given that his gerbil collection is 1/3 the number of fish, so we calculate 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine the number of days the loaf of bread will last, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. 

Let's denote the number of slices Abby eats per day as A and the number of slices Josh eats per day as J. We are given that J = 2A. The total number of slices in the loaf is 24, and the total number of slices eaten per day is A + J.

We can express this as an equation: A + J = 24. Substituting J = 2A into the equation, we get:

A + 2A = 24

Combine like terms: 3A = 24

Divide both sides by 3: A = 8

Now that we know Abby eats 8 slices per day, we can find the total number of slices eaten per day: A + J = 8 + 2(8) = 8 + 16 = 24

However, this is the total number of slices eaten per day, not the number of days the loaf will last. To find the number of days, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total number of slices eaten per day (24):

24 ÷ 24 = 1

The loaf of bread will last 1 day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To calculate the total number of shells Martha has collected, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic sequences. Since Martha collects one shell per month, the number of shells she has collected can be calculated as follows:

Number of shells = Number of months * Number of shells collected per month
= 5 years * 12 months/year * 1 shell/month
= 60 shells

Therefore, Martha has collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we must first identify the total number of mint tea cups. Given that Lana has 27 cups in total and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the number of cups of mint tea can be calculated as follows:

Total cups of mint tea = Total cups - Total cups of cinnamon tea
Total cups of mint tea = 27 - 15
Total cups of mint tea = 12

Since the cups are divided into 3 rows, we can determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row by dividing the total number of mint tea cups by 3:

Number of cups of mint tea in each row = Total cups of mint tea / 3
Number of cups of mint tea in each row = 12 / 3
Number of cups of mint tea in each row = 4

Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 4."
"To determine the minimum number of berries the sloth can collect per trip, we must first calculate the total time available for foraging. Since the sloth has 8 hours to collect berries, and each round trip takes 4 hours, the time available for foraging is 8 - 4 = 4 hours.

Given that the sloth makes 2 round trips in 8 hours, we can calculate the time spent on each round trip as 4 hours. Since the time spent on each round trip is 4 hours, and the sloth picks the same number of berries on each trip, we can divide the total number of berries by the number of round trips to find the number of berries per round trip.

Let's denote the number of berries per round trip as B. The total number of berries collected is 24, and the number of round trips is 2. We can set up the equation:

2B = 24

To solve for B, we can divide both sides by 2:

B = 24/2
B = 12

Therefore, the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick per round trip is 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we must first calculate the initial volume of water transferred from the pool. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, we can calculate this as:

Pool water volume = 10,000 gallons
Initial tank volume = Pool water volume / 2 = 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 gallons

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of water lost from the tank over 6 days, given that it is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. We can calculate this as:

Total water lost = Tank volume * Rate of emptying
Total water lost = 5,000 gallons * 6 days = 30,000 gallons

Now, we can find the remaining water in the tank by subtracting the total water lost from the initial tank volume:

Remaining water = Initial tank volume - Total water lost
Remaining water = 5,000 gallons - 30,000 gallons

However, since the tank cannot hold a negative amount of water, we must consider the scenario where the tank is emptied completely. In this case, the remaining water would be 0 gallons.

The final answer is: $oxed{0}$"
"To determine the maximum number of movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for popcorn and candy expenses.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so his remaining budget is $150 - $8 - $8 = $134.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. Now, his remaining budget is $134 - $10 = $124.

To find out how many movies he can see, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost of a movie ticket. 

$124 ÷ $10 = 12.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Colby can see 12 movies.

Final answer: 12"
"To calculate the total calories of the pastries, we need to determine the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, which can be expressed as 600/3. To simplify this fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. This results in 200 calories for a mini cinnamon roll.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, which can be expressed as 450/3. Similar to the previous calculation, we can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. This results in 150 calories for a mini blueberry muffin.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls x 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins x 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we must first determine the total number of Junebugs removed over the five-day period. 

We know that Rita removed 39 Junebugs on Monday. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs for each of those days. Therefore, the total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156.

On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs, and on Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs. 

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300

To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs removed by the number of days: 300 ÷ 5 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car, we can apply the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

The bus's distance traveled is calculated as the product of its speed and time, which yields 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles. Similarly, the car's distance traveled is found by multiplying its speed and time, resulting in 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles.

The difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car can be determined by subtracting the car's distance from the bus's distance, which gives us 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the number of bouncy balls, we can utilize the principle of addition and subtraction. 

First, we calculate the total number of toys Sophie initially had: 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48.

Next, we subtract this total from the current number of toys: 62 (current total) - 48 (initial total) = 14.

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as P + 10, and Jean's age as J.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years, so we can write the equation:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:

2P + J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2P + J = 90

Subtract J from both sides:

2P = 90 - J

Subtract 90 from both sides:

2P - 90 = -J

Divide both sides by -1:

"To determine the total number of water balloons, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 water balloons each, resulting in a total of 8 balloons. Adding Maria's 1 balloon, the total becomes 9.

Next, we need to account for the additional 3 balloons provided by Maria's mom for each of the 5 individuals (Maria and her 4 friends). This can be calculated as 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we can find the total number of balloons by adding the initial 9 balloons to the additional 15 balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

Therefore, the total number of water balloons is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of new tables required, we must first calculate the total number of boxes available. The charity group has received 10 people donating 5 boxes each, resulting in 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. Additionally, they already possess 10 boxes, bringing the total to 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since each table can accommodate 2 boxes, we can calculate the required number of tables by dividing the total number of boxes by 2. This yields 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables.

However, the charity group already has 15 tables. To find the number of new tables needed, we subtract the existing tables from the total required tables: 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables.

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables to accommodate the donated and existing items."
"To determine the average total distance spat, we must first calculate the total distance spat by each individual. 

Zoey's total distance spat is the product of the number of seeds and the distance each seed is spat: 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet.

Sydney's total distance spat is the product of the number of seeds and the distance each seed is spat: 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both individuals is the sum of their individual distances: 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by 2: 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

Therefore, the average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in earnings between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by each machine over a 30-day period.

First, let's calculate the daily production of each machine:
Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours = 1440 widgets/day
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours = 1080 widgets/day

Now, let's calculate the total production for 30 days:
Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, we'll calculate the total revenue generated by each machine:
Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $192,000

To find the difference in earnings, we subtract the revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue of the Widgeteer 3000:
$259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200

The final answer is: $67,200"
"To determine the cost of Cameron's stay, we need to calculate the cost of the initial 12-hour stay and the additional hours.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.

Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. 

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 x 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the extended stay is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the extended stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos.

Final Answer: The final answer is 250."
"To determine the total amount of hay needed, we can employ a systematic approach. Let's denote the amount of hay each goat needs as 'g' and the amount each sheep needs as 's'. We are given that each goat needs 5 pounds of hay, so g = 5.

We are also given that each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, so s = 2g - 3. Substituting g = 5 into this equation, we get s = 2(5) - 3 = 7.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for goats and sheep. The total amount of hay needed for goats is 15g, and for sheep is 12s. Substituting the values of g and s, we get:

Total hay needed = 15g + 12s
= 15(5) + 12(7)
= 75 + 84
= 159

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"To determine John's remaining funds after purchasing the pencils, we can calculate his earnings and subsequent expenses.

John's hourly wage is $50, and he worked for 6 hours, resulting in total earnings of $300. After spending $50 on gas, he has $300 - $50 = $250.

He then purchases 5 pencils at $10 each, totaling $50. Subtracting this expense from his remaining funds yields $250 - $50 = $200.

John aims to deposit $100 into the bank, leaving him with $200 - $100 = $100.

To find out how many 25-dollar pens he can purchase, we can divide his remaining funds by the cost of a single pen: $100 ÷ $25 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig and his brother, we can use the information provided. Let's denote the number of words spelled by Craig as 'C' and the number of letters in each word as 'L'. We are given that C = 20 and L = 15.

We are also told that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. This can be represented as (C + 50) * L.

Since we know C = 20 and L = 15, we can substitute these values into the equation: (20 + 50) * 15.

First, we calculate the value inside the parentheses: 20 + 50 = 70.

Then, we multiply 70 by 15: 70 * 15 = 1050.

Therefore, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 1050."
"To determine the total number of children participating in the drill, we can utilize the fundamental principle of multiplication. Given that there are 8 children in each row and 7 rows in total, we can calculate the total number of children by multiplying these two values.

The total number of children = Number of children in each row * Number of rows
= 8 * 7
= 56

Therefore, the total number of children that can be in the drill is 56."
"To determine the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we can follow a straightforward approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of bottles given to the students. Since there are 29 pupils and each student receives 2 bottles, the total number of bottles given away is 29 * 2 = 58.

Next, we consider the teacher's coupons. Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, and the teacher has 9 coupons. Therefore, the total number of bottles the teacher can obtain is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can obtain to find the number of bottles left for the teacher: 900 - 58 = 842.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To calculate the total cost, we must consider the fixed charge, labor cost, and the cost of parts. The labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (2.25) by the hourly rate ($35). This results in a labor cost of $78.75.

The total fixed charge is $40, and the cost of parts is $60. To find the total cost, we add these values together: $78.75 (labor) + $40 (fixed charge) + $60 (parts) = $178.75.

Therefore, the total cost of the job is $178.75."
"To calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount, we can use the formula:

Total Cost = Number of CDs * Price per CD
Total Cost = 10 * $15
Total Cost = $150

Since James received a 40% discount, we can calculate the discount amount as follows:

Discount Amount = 40% of Total Cost
Discount Amount = 0.4 * $150
Discount Amount = $60

The total cost after the discount is:

Total Cost after Discount = Total Cost - Discount Amount
Total Cost after Discount = $150 - $60
Total Cost after Discount = $90

Now, let's calculate the amount James made from selling 5 CDs:

Amount Made = Number of CDs Sold * Price per CD
Amount Made = 5 * $40
Amount Made = $200

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he made from the total cost after the discount:

Money James Was Out = Total Cost after Discount - Amount Made
Money James Was Out = $90 - $200
Money James Was Out = -$110

The correct answer is: -$110"
"To calculate the total earnings, we can use the following arithmetic operations:

- The value of the yams: 6 yams * $1.5 = $9
- The value of the sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 = $20
- The value of the carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 = $5

Now, let's add the values together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Therefore, the total amount Jen will earn is $34."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps and apply the concept of average speed.

Let's denote the total time taken to cross the lake as T. James swims 60% of the distance at 2 miles per hour, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. The time taken to swim this distance is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

James then rests for half the time spent swimming, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles, and James swims this distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim this distance is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time taken is the sum of the time spent swimming, resting, and swimming again:

T = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
T = 17 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we can utilize the concept of multiplication and subtraction. 

Let's denote the number of loaves Sam had last Friday as 'S'. According to the problem, the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had. This can be expressed as 7S - 40.

We are given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, so S = 70. 

Now, we can substitute S into the equation: 7(70) - 40.

First, we multiply 7 and 70: 7(70) = 490.

Then, we subtract 40 from the result: 490 - 40 = 450.

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final answer is: $\boxed{450}$"
"To determine the total number of stickers Jasmine has at the end, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. 

First, we start with the initial number of stickers Jasmine received, which is 15. Then, we subtract the number of stickers she lost during playtime, which is 7. This can be represented as 15 - 7.

Next, we add the number of stickers her teacher gave her for helping her classmates, which is 5. This can be represented as (15 - 7) + 5.

Using the order of operations, we first perform the subtraction: 15 - 7 = 8. Then, we add 5 to the result: 8 + 5 = 13.

Therefore, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

The final answer is 13."
"To calculate Cayley's total commission, we need to apply the commission rates to the respective sales of each newspaper.

"To solve this problem, we can represent the ages of Marcus, Leo, and Deanna with variables. Let's denote Marcus's age as M, Leo's age as L, and Deanna's age as D.

We are given that Deanna is 26 years old, so D = 26.

We also know that Marcus is half of Leo's age, which can be represented as M = (1/2)L.

Additionally, Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so M = D - 5.

Substituting the value of D into the second equation, we get M = (1/2)L = 26 - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we have (1/2)L = 21.

To solve for L, we can multiply both sides by 2, resulting in L = 2 * 21 = 42.

Therefore, Leo's age is 42 years old."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic methods to represent the given information and solve for the unknowns. Let's denote the number of points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, we can represent Bahati's score as (x + 20). Given that Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, we can express Bahati's score as (x + 10). 

We know that the total points scored by all three team members is 45. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 20) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:

3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 5

Now that we have found Dinar's score, we can determine Azibo's score. Since Azibo scored 10 points less than Bahati, and Bahati scored 5 points, Azibo scored (5 - 10) points.

x + 10 - 20 = 5 - 10
= 5 - 10
= -5

However, since the number of points cannot be negative, we re-evaluate the equation. We made an error in our previous steps. Let's re-evaluate the equation.

x + (x + 10) + (x + 20) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:

3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 5

Now that we have found Dinar's score, we can determine Azibo's score. Since Azibo scored 10 points less than Bahati, and Bahati scored 5 points, we need to re-evaluate the relationship between Bahati and Azibo's scores.

Let's re-examine the original statement: ""Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored."" This implies that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, and Azibo scored 10 points more than Dinar. 

Since Dinar scored 5 points, Azibo scored 5 + 10 = 15 points. 

Therefore, Azibo scored 15 points.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we must consider the given information. The book's thickness is 1.5 inches, and each paper is 100 pages to the inch, with each paper having two sides. 

Since each paper has two sides, the effective number of pages per inch is 2. 

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages in the book by multiplying the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

Therefore, the book contains 3 pages."
"To calculate the total number of reports stapled by Vince, we need to determine the total minutes he worked and then divide that by the time interval at which he staples reports.

The time period from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM can be broken down into two segments: 4 hours (from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM) and 11 hours (from 12:00 PM to 11:00 PM). 

First, we convert the hours to minutes: 
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
11 hours = 11 * 60 = 660 minutes

Total minutes = 240 + 660 = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can calculate the total number of reports stapled by dividing the total minutes by 15:
Total reports = 900 / 15 = 60

Therefore, Vince stapled 60 reports in total."
"To calculate the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's calculate the total minutes she slept from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. normally. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can multiply the hours by 60:

10 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 600 minutes

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. To account for this, we'll subtract 5 minutes from the total sleep time:

600 minutes - 5 minutes = 595 minutes

Next, we need to calculate the time she went to sleep. Since she woke up at 2:15 a.m. and usually wakes up at 6 a.m., we can find the difference:

6 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 3 hours and 45 minutes
Converting this to minutes:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes
Adding the remaining 45 minutes:
180 minutes + 45 minutes = 225 minutes

Now, we need to subtract the time she went to sleep from her usual sleep time to find the time she was sleepwalking. We'll subtract 225 minutes from 595 minutes:

595 minutes - 225 minutes = 370 minutes

However, she was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. We need to add those minutes to the total sleep time:

370 minutes + 23 minutes = 393 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{393}$"
"To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we must first calculate the number of measuring spoons he has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has 24 measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Number of measuring spoons = (2/3) * 24
= (2 * 24) / 3
= 48 / 3
= 16

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan has 24 measuring cups, and 10 measuring spoons, so the total number of utensils he has remaining is:
24 + 10 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to first determine the initial number of occupied beds and then account for the daily admissions.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 of them occupied. This can be expressed as a decimal: 1/5 = 0.2. Multiply the capacity by this decimal to find the initial number of occupied beds: 1000 * 0.2 = 200 beds.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we multiply this rate by the number of days in 2 weeks (14 days): 50 * 14 = 700 patients.

Now, we add the initial number of occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted to find the new total number of occupied beds: 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's capacity: 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we must first identify the non-work emails and then calculate the fraction of those that are directed towards her boyfriend.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Total emails per day = 16
2. Work emails per day = 7
3. Non-work emails per day = Total emails per day - Work emails per day
   Non-work emails per day = 16 - 7
   Non-work emails per day = 9

Now, we need to find the number of emails to her family, which is two-thirds of the non-work emails.

Emails to family per day = (2/3) * Non-work emails per day
   Emails to family per day = (2/3) * 9
   Emails to family per day = 6

To find the number of emails to her boyfriend, we need to subtract the emails to family from the non-work emails and then take one-third of the result.

Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * (Non-work emails per day - Emails to family per day)
   Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * (9 - 6)
   Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * 3
   Emails to boyfriend per day = 1

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine Shawna's father's age, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between Shawna's age and Aliya's age. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years

Now, we can calculate Shawna's father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5, as Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number. 

First, let's calculate 20% of 48. To do this, we'll multiply 48 by 0.20, which is equivalent to 48 * (20/100) or 48 * 0.20.

48 * 0.20 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Therefore, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{38.4}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of balls carried by each individual. Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason's balls can be represented as 2x. Similarly, Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan's balls can be represented as 2(2x) = 4x.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, which allows us to solve for x:

2 = 2x
x = 1

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of balls carried by each individual:

Jeffrey's balls = x = 1
Jason's balls = 2x = 2
Jordan's balls = 4x = 4

The total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:

Total balls = Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls
Total balls = 4 + 2 + 1
Total balls = 7

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of holes dug on the fourth day as x. We know that the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug at the end of the first day. 

We can set up the equation: 10 + 13 + 6 + x = 4(10 + 13 + 6)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 29 + x = 4(29)

Expanding the right side, we get: 29 + x = 116

Subtracting 29 from both sides, we get: x = 87

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 87.

The final answer is: $\boxed{87}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote the number of corn chips Amora and Lainey each got as 'x'. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that the total number of corn chips is the sum of what Amora, Lainey, and Collins got. Since there are only two people getting an equal amount, we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x + 15) = Total

Combine like terms:

3x + 15 = Total

We are given that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can substitute x = 70 into the equation:

3(70) + 15 = Total

Simplify the equation:

210 + 15 = Total

Combine the constants:

225 = Total

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"To calculate the cost of travel, we can use the following formula:

Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + (50% of Cost of supplies)

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Cost of travel = $400 + 0.5 x $400

Using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can simplify this expression:

Cost of travel = $400 + $200
= $600

Therefore, the cost of travel is $600."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a systematic approach to isolate the variable S, which represents the number of Pokémon caught by Stan.

Let's begin by expressing the given information in a more formalized manner:

1. The total number of Pokémon caught by the trio is 339: A + S + X = 339
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan: X = S + 5
3. Stan has caught 13 fewer Pokémon than four times the number caught by Adelwolfe: S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the expression for X from equation (2) into equation (1) to eliminate X:

A + S + (S + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:

2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the expression for S from equation (3) into the equation:

2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339

Expand and simplify:

8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339

Combine like terms:

9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:

A = 40

Now that we have found A, we can substitute this value back into equation (3) to solve for S:

S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"To determine the total time John will spend watching the show, we can utilize the fundamental principles of arithmetic. Given that each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can calculate the total time by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode.

Let's apply the arithmetic operation of multiplication to find the total time:

Total time = Number of episodes × Length of each episode
Total time = 10 × 20
Total time = 200

Therefore, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode."
"To calculate the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we can use the concept of displacement, which is the total distance traveled in a straight line. Since the bird's movements form a triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the displacement.

Let's break down the bird's journey into its components:

1. The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, covering a distance of:
d1 = speed × time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles

2. The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, covering a distance of:
d2 = speed × time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles

3. The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, covering a distance of:
d3 = speed × time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles

Since the bird's movements form a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the displacement (d):
d² = d1² + d2² + d3²
d² = 300² + 36² + 110²
d² = 90000 + 1296 + 12100
d² = 144996
d = √144996 ≈ 380.99 miles

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is approximately 380.99 miles.

The final answer is: 380.99"
"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had, we must consider the various components of her brownie collection.

First, we'll calculate the total number of brownies she initially had. She made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself, which is equivalent to 12 individual brownies. Then, she received 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies at the office party. To add these, we'll convert 1/2 dozen to a whole number: 1/2 dozen = 6 brownies. Now, we can add the brownies: 12 + 6 = 18.

Next, her friends brought 4 dozen (48) brownies to her home. To maintain consistency, we'll convert 4 dozen to a whole number: 4 dozen = 48 brownies. Now, we can add these to the previous total: 18 + 48 = 66.

Finally, during the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten. To add these to the previous total, we'll convert 1 1/2 dozen to a whole number: 1 1/2 dozen = 18 brownies. Now, we can subtract the eaten brownies: 66 - 18 = 48.

Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total age of the family members, we can break down the problem into individual components.

First, we calculate the age of Nani's brother, which is twice Nani's age. This can be expressed as 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Next, we find the age of Nani's sister, who is 25% younger than Nani. To calculate this, we can use the formula: (1 - 0.25) * 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of Nani (8), his brother (16), and his sister (6). To find the total age, we add these values together: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

Therefore, the total age of the family members is 30 years."
"To calculate the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we can break down the task into separate components based on the type of string used.

First, let's calculate the time required for each type of string:

- Time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
- Time for polyester racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
- Time for hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

To find the total time, we add these values together: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is 227 minutes."
"To calculate the total cost of the phones, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The cost of the first two phones is 2 x $600 = $1200.

Since each phone after the first two is half price, we can calculate the cost of the remaining phones as 3 x $300 = $900.

The total cost is the sum of these two amounts: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

Therefore, the total cost of the phones is $2100."
"To determine the total number of players in both teams, we can utilize the concept of addition. Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players, we can calculate the total number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

Let's perform the calculation: 13 + 7 = 20

Now, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players in Carlton's team to the number of players in Zeke's team: 13 + 20 = 33

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To determine the total number of wooden slats required, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

Perimeter = 2(length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total wooden slats needed = 2 * Perimeter
Total wooden slats needed = 2 * 50
Total wooden slats needed = 100

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats for his fence."
"To determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we must first calculate the total number of oranges she had initially. Since each box contains 20 oranges, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box:

12 boxes × 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

Next, we need to find the number of oranges she gave to her mom and sister. Since they each received 2 boxes, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of recipients and then by the number of oranges per box:

2 boxes/recipient × 2 recipients = 4 boxes
4 boxes × 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges

Now, we can calculate the number of oranges she kept:

1/4 of 240 oranges = 240 ÷ 4 = 60 oranges

Finally, we can find the number of oranges she had left after giving some to her mom and sister:

240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges

Since she sold the rest, the number of oranges she sold is 160 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the total number of states in both countries, we must first establish the number of states in the United States and India.

The United States has 50 states. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. To calculate this, we can use the formula: 

Number of states in India = (Number of states in the USA / 2) + 4

Number of states in India = (50 / 2) + 4
Number of states in India = 25 + 4
Number of states in India = 29

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India together: 
Total number of states = 50 + 29
Total number of states = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to purchase. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 

The total cost of the items can be found by adding these amounts together: $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, we can subtract this amount from the total cost to find the amount he still needs: $39 - $14 = $25.

Now, we can divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find the number of hours he must work: $25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as 'r' and the number of cherries Jerry has as 'j'. We are given that Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, so we can express this as an equation:

r + 10 = 30

Solving for 'r', we get:

r = 30 - 10
r = 20

Now, we know Richard has 20 cherries. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we can subtract the total number of cherries (60) and Robert's cherries (30) from the total:

j = 60 - 30 - r
j = 60 - 30 - 20
j = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
= 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the total earnings for Sunny's two-day fundraiser, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of gingerbread and apple pie boxes sold, and their respective prices.

Let's denote the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Saturday as G and the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday as A. We know that Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday, so G = 10.

We are also given that Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than on Sunday. Since he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, we can express the number of apple pie boxes sold on Sunday as A + 4 = 15. Solving for A, we get A = 11.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for each day:

Saturday's earnings = (G * 6) + (A * 15) = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225

Sunday's earnings = (15 * 6) + (6 * 15) = 90 + 90 = 180

Total earnings for two days = 225 + 180 = 405

The final answer is: $405"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of hours she will be outside. Since she will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, we can multiply the number of hours per day by the number of days:

Total hours = 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Since Pamela reapplies sunscreen every hour, we can divide the total number of hours by the number of ounces per bottle to find the total number of bottles needed:

Total bottles = Total hours / 8 ounces/bottle
Total bottles = 32 hours / 8 ounces/bottle
Total bottles = 4 bottles

Therefore, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"To find the price of the red car, we can use the concept of percentage decrease. Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we can calculate the price of the red car by finding 60% of the price of the blue car (100% - 40% = 60%).

Price of the red car = 60% of the price of the blue car
= 0.6 x $100
= $60

Therefore, the price of the red car is $60.

The price of the blue car is $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We are given that E = 19. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so we can write the equation:

24 = D/2

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

D = 48

We are also given that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so we can write the equation:

24 = 2B

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

B = 12

Now that we have the current ages of Emil (E = 19), his dad (D = 48), and his brother (B = 12), we can find the sum of their ages:

E + D + B = 19 + 48 + 12

Simplifying the expression, we get:

E + D + B = 79

The final answer is: $\boxed{79}$"
"To determine the total number of beads Adrianne has, we can apply basic arithmetic principles. 

First, we need to calculate the number of beads given by her sister, which is 10 more than the number of beads given by her mother. This can be expressed as 20 + 10.

Next, we calculate the number of beads given by her friend, which is twice the number of beads given by her mother. This can be expressed as 2 * 20.

Now, we add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend: 20 + (20 + 10) + (2 * 20).

Using the order of operations, we first calculate the expression inside the parentheses: 20 + 10 = 30. Then, we multiply 2 by 20, which equals 40. Finally, we add 20, 30, and 40: 20 + 30 + 40 = 90.

Therefore, Adrianne has 90 beads altogether.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the total number of crawfish Joe caught, we must first calculate the amount he caught each day. 

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught:
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:
21 / 3 = 7

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we must first determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding their sizes and dividing by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

Therefore, the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the total cost of the flowers, we need to calculate the number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed and then multiply it by the cost per plant.

First, let's convert the length of the bed from feet to inches: 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Next, we need to account for the space between each plant. Since Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet between each plant, we convert this to inches: 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches.

Now, we subtract the space between plants from the total length of the bed: 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.

To find out how many plants Pat can fit, we divide the remaining space by the width of each plant (12 inches): 1314 inches / 12 inches = 109.5.

Since Pat can't fit a fraction of a plant, we round down to 109 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 109 - 17 = 92 more flowers.

The cost of each flower is $6, so the total cost will be 92 flowers * $6/flower = $552.

The final answer is: $552"
"To determine the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we can apply the concept of proportional reasoning. Since Edgar's brother consumes half the amount of pretzels Edgar does, we can express this relationship as a ratio.

Let x be the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. The ratio of Edgar's brother's daily pretzel consumption to Edgar's daily pretzel consumption is 1:2, or 1/2. We can set up the equation:

x / 18 = 1/2

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 18

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 9

Now that we know Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels per day, we can calculate his weekly consumption by multiplying this value by 7:

9 pretzels/day × 7 days = 63 pretzels/week

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is 63."
"To calculate the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of petunias and the cost of sweet potato vines.

The cost of petunias can be calculated as 5 baskets multiplied by 3 petunias per basket, then multiplied by the cost per petunia: 5 × 3 × $3.00 = $45.00.

Similarly, the cost of sweet potato vines can be calculated as 5 baskets multiplied by 2 vines per basket, then multiplied by the cost per vine: 5 × 2 × $2.50 = $25.00.

The total cost is the sum of these two values: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To determine the number of roses that can be planted, we must first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

The total amount of soil used for the sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.
The total amount of soil used for the carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

The total amount of soil used for both sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since the total amount of soil available is 30 pounds, the remaining amount of soil for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Given that each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the number of roses that can be planted is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate her monthly savings and then divide it by the cost of each pair of shoes.

First, let's calculate 25% of her monthly income: 0.25 * $2,000 = $500.

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we multiply this amount by 12 to find her annual savings: $500 * 12 = $6,000.

Now, we divide her annual savings by the cost of each pair of shoes: $6,000 / $1,000 = 6.

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we can break down the problem into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, let's analyze the peeling process. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we can divide 90 by 6:

Time to peel 90 shrimp = 90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Next, we need to consider the cooking process. Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we can divide 90 by 30:

Time to cook 90 shrimp = 90 / 30 = 3 minutes

Since these tasks are performed sequentially, we add the time it takes to peel and cook:

Total time = Time to peel + Time to cook = 15 minutes + 3 minutes = 18 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 18 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

Answer: 18"
"To determine the final temperature, we need to consider the cooling and warming effects of the air conditioner.

Let's break down the process into two parts: the cooling effect and the warming effect.

The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. The total cooling effect can be calculated as:

Cooling effect = (Rate on low x Time on low) + (Rate on high x Time on high)
= (2 degrees/hour x 3 hours) + (3 degrees/hour x 4 hours)
= 6 degrees + 12 degrees
= 18 degrees

Since the room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour, the net cooling effect can be calculated as:

Net cooling effect = Cooling effect - Warming effect
= 18 degrees - (2 degrees/hour x 2 hours)
= 18 degrees - 4 degrees
= 14 degrees

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Final answer: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as x. We know that Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, which can be expressed as:

Bill's age = 3 * (30 + x)

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can set up the equation:

3 * (30 + x) = 90 + 75

Simplifying the equation, we get:

90 + 3x = 165

Subtracting 90 from both sides:

3x = 75

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 25

Now that we know x, we can find Bill's age when his dad saw the comet:

Bill's dad's age = 30 + x
= 30 + 25
= 55

Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can find Bill's age:

Bill's age = 3 * 55
= 165

However, this is the age at which Bill saw the comet for the second time. To find Bill's age when he first saw the comet, we need to subtract 75 years:

Bill's age (first time) = 165 - 75
= 90

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we must consider the frequency of each check type and calculate the total accordingly.

First, we calculate the total number of checks for the bills: 1 (electric) + 1 (gas) = 2 checks per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of checks for the bills is 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.

Next, we consider the checks to the church, which occur twice a month. Therefore, the total number of checks to the church per year is 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.

Lastly, we have the quarterly checks to the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, the total number of checks for this service is 4 checks per year.

Now, we add up the total number of checks for all services: 24 (bills) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52 checks per year.

The final answer is 52."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. 

First, we know the first plane makes a total of 88 trips. Since it goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, we can calculate the number of flights to Greece as follows:

Number of flights to Greece = Total flights * (3/4)
= 88 * (3/4)
= 66

Now, we know the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. To find the number of flights to France, we subtract the number of flights to Greece from the total number of flights:

Number of flights to France = Total flights - Number of flights to Greece
= 88 - 66
= 22

Therefore, the first plane makes 22 flights to France in one day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"The problem at hand involves determining the combined duration of the howls of three wolves, Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous. To approach this, we must first establish the duration of each wolf's howl.

Tobias's howl lasts for 20 seconds. Chikote's howl is twice as long as Tobias's, so Chikote's howl is 2 × 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous's howl is the sum of the other two, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

To find the total duration, we add the individual howl times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 ÷ 60 = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings, we must first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents. 

Let's denote the amount his mother gave as M and the amount his father gave as 2M, since his father gave twice as much as his mother. We know that M = $6. Therefore, the total amount his parents gave him is M + 2M = 3M = $6 + $12 = $18.

Now, we can calculate the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings by subtracting the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

$30 - $18 = $12

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the ages of the children as A, B, H, and W, representing Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred, respectively.

We know that the total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:

A + B + H + W = 20

We are also given that Helene is twice the average age of the group. Since there are 4 children, the average age is (A + B + H + W) / 4. We can set up the equation:

H = 2 * ((A + B + H + W) / 4)

We are also given that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old, so we can substitute these values into the equation:

A = 3
B = 4

Substituting these values into the first equation, we get:

3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine like terms:

7 + H + W = 20

Subtract 7 from both sides:

H + W = 13

Now, substitute the expression for H from the second equation:

2 * ((3 + 4 + H + W) / 4) = H

Simplify the equation:

2 * ((7 + H + W) / 4) = H

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

2 * (7 + H + W) = 4H

Expand the left side:

14 + 2H + 2W = 4H

Subtract 2H from both sides:

14 + 2W = 2H

Subtract 14 from both sides:

2W = 2H - 14

Divide both sides by 2:

W = H - 7

Now, substitute W = H - 7 into the equation H + W = 13:

H + (H - 7) = 13

Combine like terms:

2H - 7 = 13

Add 7 to both sides:

2H = 20

Divide both sides by 2:

H = 10

Now that we have found H, we can find W by substituting H into the equation W = H - 7:

W = 10 - 7

W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to analyze the sequence of events. Walter initially collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from a fund, totaling $2000. However, his friend's contribution of $200 should be subtracted from this total, resulting in $2000 - $200 = $1800.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates, we multiply the adjusted total by 3. This yields 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The final answer is: $5400"
"To determine the number of people in the church, we must first calculate the total number of cookies available for distribution. With 100 guests contributing 15 cookies each, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

Since the bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church, we can calculate the number of cookies given as 1500 / 2 = 750.

Now, to find the number of people in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given (750) by the number of cookies each person received (15). This results in 750 / 15 = 50.

Therefore, there were 50 people in the church."
"To divide a watermelon among a family of 6, where 2 adults and 4 kids are to receive slices, and each adult slice is twice as large as each kid's slice, we can apply the concept of ratios and proportions.

Let's denote the number of kid slices as x. Since each adult slice is twice as large as each kid slice, the number of adult slices is 2x. The total number of slices is 6, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 6

Combine like terms:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

Now that we know x = 2, we can determine the number of kid slices (2) and adult slices (4).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of the sizes of all slices. Since there are 2 kid slices and 4 adult slices, and each adult slice is twice as large as each kid slice, let's represent the size of a kid slice as y. Then, the size of an adult slice is 2y.

The total size of the watermelon is 2y + 4(2y) = 2y + 8y = 10y.

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we can divide the size of the adult slices (4y) by the total size of the watermelon (10y) and multiply by 100:

(4y / 10y) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, each adult gets 40% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40\%}$"
"To determine the time left for updating records, we must first calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments. 

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Converting the total time to hours: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest start time for Jordan to make the cake, we need to calculate the total time required for the entire process. 

The total time is the sum of the individual times: 
- Preparation time: 20 minutes (making the cake batter) + 30 minutes (baking the cake) = 50 minutes
- Cooling time: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Frosting time: 10 minutes

Total time = 50 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours and minutes, we get:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, we subtract the total time from the serving time to find the latest start time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: 2:00 pm"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Since Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars sold by both of them can be represented as:

3.5x + 4.5x = 64

Combining like terms, we get:

8x = 64

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 8:

x = 64 / 8

x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we can break down the costs into two components: the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost of the students' lessons.

The fixed cost of renting the studio is $25 per session, and it is rented 3 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total fixed cost for the month is $25 * 3 * 4 = $300.

The variable cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 per student per session, and there are 10 students. The total weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 = $15. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total variable cost for the month is $15 * 4 = $60.

The total expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost, which is $300 + $60 = $360.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $360."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as x.

Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, his total number of chocolate bars can be represented as 4x. Similarly, Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, so her total number of chocolate bars can be represented as 7x.

We are given that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars. We can set up the following equations:

4x = 64
7x = 56

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of each equation by the coefficient of x.

x = 64 / 4
x = 56 / 7

x = 16
x = 8

Now that we have found the value of x, we can find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha.

Difference = Number of chocolate bars in Peter's box - Number of chocolate bars in Martha's box
= 16 - 8
= 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total population of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to calculate the number of new porcupines born and add it to the initial population.

First, we find the number of female porcupines, which is 3/5 of the total population. 

Number of female porcupines = (3/5) * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines, which is 50 + 1440 = 1490.

Therefore, the total population of porcupines in the park after a year is 1490.

Final answer: 1490"
"To calculate the volume of the pool, we can utilize the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is given by:

V = lwh

where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth, in this case).

Given the dimensions of the pool: length (l) = 25 feet, width (w) = 14 feet, and depth (h) = 4 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

V = lwh
V = 25 x 14 x 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

To convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons, we know that 1 cubic foot is equivalent to approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, we can multiply the volume in cubic feet by this conversion factor:

Total gallons = V x 7.48
Total gallons = 1400 x 7.48
Total gallons ≈ 10496.8 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we can multiply the total gallons by this rate:

Cost = Total gallons x 0.10
Cost ≈ 10496.8 x 0.10
Cost ≈ $1049.68

The cost to fill the pool is approximately $1049.68."
"To determine the total number of sticks, we can break down the problem into three separate equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of red sticks as R, blue sticks as B, and yellow sticks as Y. We are given the following information:

1. R = 9
2. B = R + 5
3. Y = B - 3

We can substitute the value of R into equation (2) to find the value of B:
B = 9 + 5
B = 14

Next, we can substitute the value of B into equation (3) to find the value of Y:
Y = 14 - 3
Y = 11

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the values of R, B, and Y:
Total = R + B + Y
Total = 9 + 14 + 11
Total = 34

Therefore, the total number of sticks is 34."
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between Matteo and Shandy, we can apply the formula for distance, which is:

Distance = Speed × Time

For Matteo: Distance = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy: Distance = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we can find the difference in distance traveled by subtracting Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance:

Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance
= 450 miles - 220 miles
= 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"To determine the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the information into distinct categories.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old, which accounts for 1500 students. Since one-fourth of these students are male, we can calculate the number of male students over 16 as 1500 / 4 = 375. Consequently, the remaining female students over 16 are 1500 - 375 = 1125.

Next, we're told that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which also equals 1500 students. One-half of these students are male, so the number of male students under 16 is 1500 / 2 = 750. Therefore, the number of female students under 16 is 1500 - 750 = 750.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To determine the number of laps Bethany can run more than Quinn, we need to calculate the difference between their respective lap counts.

First, we establish the number of laps each individual can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we calculate the difference between Bethany's and Quinn's lap counts: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on both days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. So, the total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. So, the total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons. To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:

Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can set up an equation:
34% + x = 28%

"To calculate the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we can use the following steps:

First, we need to calculate the total amount Janet needs to save, which is 20% of the cost of the car.

Total amount needed = 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Next, we need to calculate Janet's total hourly wage, which is the sum of her wage and tip.

Total hourly wage = $10/hour (wage) + $15/hour (tip) = $25/hour

Now, we can calculate the number of hours Janet needs to work to save the down payment by dividing the total amount needed by her total hourly wage.

Number of hours needed = Total amount needed / Total hourly wage
= $2,000 / $25/hour
= 80 hours

Finally, we can calculate the number of weeks Janet needs to work by dividing the total hours needed by her weekly hours.

Number of weeks needed = Total hours needed / Weekly hours
= 80 hours / 40 hours/week
= 2 weeks

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment.

Final answer: 2"
"To determine the number of plums Jamaar can buy, we must first calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

The cost of peaches is 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
The cost of pears is 4 x $0.75 = $3
The cost of kiwis is 2 x $1 = $2
The cost of apples is 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

The total amount spent on other fruits is $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar has $10, we can find the amount of money left by subtracting the total amount spent from his initial amount: $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25. However, this result is not possible, as he cannot spend a negative amount. This indicates that Jamaar has insufficient funds to purchase any additional fruits.

Therefore, the number of plums Jamaar can buy is 0.

Final answer: 0"
"To determine the number of pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we must first calculate the total number of pieces she gave away. 

We know that Anne kept 2 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces she kept is 2 * 60 = 120.

Since Anne gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces she gave away is 13 * 60 = 780.

Now, we divide the total number of pieces given away (780) by the number of friends (10) to find the number of pieces each friend received:

780 ÷ 10 = 78

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal amount (initial price), r is the annual interest rate (5% in this case), and n is the number of years.

Given P = $120 and r = 0.05, we can plug these values into the formula:

A = 120(1 + 0.05)^3
A = 120(1.05)^3
A = 120(1.157625)
A = 139.25

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

"To determine the number of portraits and selfies, we can utilize the concept of division to allocate the total number of pictures among the albums. 

Given that Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and divided them into 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album as follows:

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were designated for selfies, and each album contains 9 pictures, we can calculate the number of selfies as:

3 × 9 = 27

Similarly, as 2 albums were allocated for portraits, and each album contains 9 pictures, we can calculate the number of portraits as:

2 × 9 = 18

Therefore, Olivia has 18 portraits and 27 selfies.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the total time James spends reading, we can utilize the concept of unit rates. Given that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can establish a unit rate of 3 pages per 10 minutes. 

To find the time it takes James to read 18 pages, we can set up a proportion:

3 pages / 10 minutes = 18 pages / x minutes

Cross-multiplying, we get:

3x = 18 * 10
3x = 180
x = 180 / 3
x = 60

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To determine the current number of guests at the hotel, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. Then, 24 guests checked out early, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests. 

Next, 15 guests opted for late checkout, reducing the number of guests to 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for late checkout. This means 2 * 15 = 30 guests arrived. The total number of guests now is 61 + 30 = 91.

Finally, 7 more people checked in after dinner, bringing the total to 91 + 7 = 98 guests.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"To determine the total number of bananas John has, we can apply the principle of arithmetic addition. 

Let's break down the problem:

John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday.
He picks 6 bananas on Thursday.
On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas

Therefore, John has 22 bananas."
"To determine the number of easy questions, we can calculate 40% of 60, which is equivalent to 0.4 * 60 = 24.

The remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult, so we have 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. Dividing this by 2 gives us 36 / 2 = 18 average and difficult questions each.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 24 * 0.75 = 18. She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 18 * 0.5 = 9.

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we add the points from easy and average/difficult questions: 18 + 9 = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the price of a large stuffed animal as x and the number of large stuffed animals sold as y. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x.

Given that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, we can express the total revenue from large and small stuffed animals as:

Total Revenue = (Price of large stuffed animal) * (Number of large stuffed animals) + (Price of small stuffed animal) * (Number of small stuffed animals)
120 = 3x * y + 8y

Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, we can express the number of small stuffed animals as 2y. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

120 = 3x * y + 8(2y)
120 = 3xy + 16y

Now, we can factor out y from the right-hand side:

120 = y(3x + 16)

Since we want to find the number of small stuffed animals sold, we need to find the value of y. To do this, we can divide both sides by (3x + 16):

y = 120 / (3x + 16)

However, we still need to find the value of x. We can use the fact that the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x. Since the problem doesn't provide a direct relationship between x and a known value, we can use the given information that the total revenue is $120. We can express the total revenue as:

120 = 3x * y + 8y
120 = y(3x + 8)

Now, we can divide both sides by y:

120/y = 3x + 8

Since we want to find the value of y, we can rearrange the equation to isolate y:

y = 120 / (3x + 8)

However, we still need to find the value of x. We can use the fact that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x, we can set up a proportion:

3x / 4 = 3

Cross-multiplying, we get:

3x = 12

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 4

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into the equation:

y = 120 / (3x + 8)
y = 120 / (3(4) + 8)
y = 120 / 16
y = 7.5

Since we can't sell a fraction of a stuffed animal, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that y = 7.5 is not a valid solution, as it would imply that Teresa sold a fraction of a stuffed animal. Therefore, we need to re-examine our steps.

Let's re-evaluate the equation:

120 = y(3x + 16)

We can try to find a value of x that makes the equation true. Since the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x, we can try x = 4:

120 = y(3(4) + 16)
120 = y(12 + 16)
120 = y(28)

Dividing both sides by 28, we get:

y = 120 / 28
y = 4.29

Again, we can't sell a fraction of a stuffed animal, so we need to re-examine our steps. Let's try x = 4.5:

120 = y(3(4.5) + 16)
120 = y(13.5 + 16)
120 = y(29.5)

Dividing both sides by 29.5, we get:

y = 120 / 29.5
y = 4.07

Still, we can't sell a fraction of a stuffed animal. Let's try x = 5:

120 = y(3(5) + 16)
120 = y(15 + 16)
120 = y(31)

Dividing both sides by 31, we get:

y = 120 / 31
y = 3.87

Again, we can't sell a fraction of a stuffed animal. Let's try x = 6:

120 = y(3(6) + 16)
120 = y(18 + 16)
120 = y(34)

Dividing both sides by 34, we get:

y = 120 / 34
y = 3.53

Still, we can't sell a fraction of a stuffed animal. Let's try x = 7:

120 = y(3(7) + 16)
120 = y(21 + 16)
120 = y(37)

Dividing both sides by 37, we get:

y = 120 / 37
y = 3.24

Again, we can't sell a fraction of a stuffed animal. Let's try x = 8:

120 = y(3(8) + 16)
120 = y(24 + 16)
120 = y(40)

Dividing both sides by 40, we get:

y = 120 / 40
y = 3

Now that we have a valid value for y, we can conclude that Teresa sold 3 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 3"
"To calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic sequences and series. 

First, we need to find the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by adding the individual daily consumption of the man, his wife, and their son. 

Total sandwiches eaten per day = 5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the total sandwiches eaten per day by 7 to find the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week.

Total sandwiches eaten in a week = 11 * 7 = 77

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To calculate Suzanne's remaining earnings, we must first determine her total earnings from the sale of cookies and cupcakes. 

The total earnings from cookies can be calculated as 80 * $1 = $80. Similarly, the total earnings from cupcakes can be calculated as 60 * $4 = $240. 

Now, we add these two amounts together to find the total earnings: $80 + $240 = $320.

Next, we subtract the amount given to her sisters, $20, from the total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

Final answer: $300"
"To determine the number of eggs found by the friends, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of eggs found by the twins: 2 * 30 = 60 eggs.

Next, we subtract the number of eggs not found by the friends (10 eggs) from the total number of eggs (100 eggs): 100 - 10 = 90 eggs.

Therefore, the friends found 90 eggs.

The final answer is: 90"
"To calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to determine the daily ore mining capacity of a single dwarf with a steel pickaxe. We know that a dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands and 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe. Since a steel pickaxe provides 50% more ore than an iron pickaxe, we can calculate the daily ore mining capacity with a steel pickaxe as follows:

Daily ore mining capacity with steel pickaxe = 24 pounds/day * 1.5 = 36 pounds/day

Now, we can calculate the total daily ore mining capacity of 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes:

Total daily ore mining capacity = 40 dwarves * 36 pounds/day = 1440 pounds/day

To find the total amount of ore mined in a month, we multiply the total daily ore mining capacity by the number of days in a month (30):

Total ore mined in a month = 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = 43200 pounds

The final answer is: 43200"
"In proportional reasoning, we can establish a ratio between the number of sandwiches and the cost. Let's denote the unknown cost of the package with 8 sandwiches as x.

We have two known packages: one with 2 sandwiches for $3 and another with 4 sandwiches for $6. We can set up a proportion to relate the number of sandwiches to the cost:

(2 sandwiches) / $3 = (4 sandwiches) / $6

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2 * 6 = 3 * 4
12 = 12

This proportion is true, indicating that the prices are indeed proportional. Now, we can use this proportion to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:

(8 sandwiches) / x = (2 sandwiches) / $3
8 / x = 2 / 3
x = 8 * (3 / 2)
x = 12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

Final answer: $12"
"To calculate the monthly payment, we can use the formula for calculating simple interest. Since Tom is paying 10% of the remaining amount owed, we can express this as a decimal by dividing by 100: 10% = 0.10.

Remaining amount owed: $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To determine the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

First, we calculate the number of red balloons that burst: 40% of 25 red balloons is equal to 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. Therefore, the number of red balloons remaining is 25 - 10 = 15.

Next, we calculate the number of yellow balloons released: half of 12 yellow balloons is 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is 12 - 6 = 6.

Now, we calculate the number of blue balloons added: 75% of 8 blue balloons is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

Finally, we add the remaining red, yellow, and blue balloons: 15 red + 6 yellow + 6 blue = 27 balloons.

The final answer is 27."
"To determine the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we can apply the law of total probability. Let's define the events:

A = Marcus has to turn in his homework
B = Normal teacher comes in
C = Substitute teacher comes in
D = Marcus gets an extension

We are given the following probabilities:

P(B) = 0.5 (50% chance of a normal teacher)
P(D|B) = 0.4 (40% chance of getting an extension if the normal teacher comes in)
P(D|C) = 0.6 (60% chance of not getting an extension if the substitute teacher comes in)
P(A|B, D) = 0 (Marcus won't have to turn in his homework if he gets an extension)
P(A|C, D) = 1 (Marcus will have to turn in his homework if he doesn't get an extension)

Using the law of total probability, we can calculate P(A) as follows:

P(A) = P(B) * P(A|B) + P(C) * P(A|C, D)
= 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 1
= 0.5

However, this calculation only accounts for the scenarios where Marcus doesn't get an extension. We need to consider the scenario where Marcus gets an extension. The probability of this occurring is P(B) * P(D|B) = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2. In this case, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. Therefore, we need to add this probability to the previous result:

P(A) = P(B) * P(A|B) + P(C) * P(A|C, D) + P(B) * P(D|B) * (1 - P(A|B, D))
= 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0.4 * (1 - 0)
= 0.5 + 0.2
= 0.7

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.7 * 100 = 70%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 70%.

Final answer: $\boxed{70\%}$"
"To determine the number of tickets each graduate would receive, we must first calculate the total number of seats taken by graduates and faculty. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 ÷ 950 = 5

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportional reasoning. Let's denote the number of large beans as L, the number of medium beans as M, and the number of small beans as S.

We are given that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, so L = 75.

We are also given that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, so M = 2L = 2(75) = 150.

Furthermore, we know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean, so S = 3M = 3(150) = 450.

Therefore, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is 450.

The final answer is: $\boxed{450}$"
"To calculate Melissa's hourly wage after expenses, we must first determine her total daily income and then subtract her daily expenses. 

Total daily income = $15 per day
Total daily expenses = $3 per day

Daily income after expenses = Total daily income - Total daily expenses

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to find the total number of bottles that can fit along the driveway. Given that the driveway is 24 feet wide and a bottle is placed every 3 feet, we can calculate the total number of bottles as follows:

Total number of bottles = Total length of driveway / Distance between bottles
Total number of bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle
Total number of bottles = 8

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. The time taken to move from one bottle to the next is 5 seconds. Therefore, the total time it will take is:

Total time = Number of moves * Time per move
Total time = 7 * 5 seconds
Total time = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she purchased.

The cost of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she bought 2 pounds, so the total cost of Parmesan is 2 × $11 = $22.
The cost of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds, so the total cost of Mozzarella is 3 × $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50, so to find out how much money she will have left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:
$50 - $40 = $10.

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To calculate the break-even point for Jim, we need to consider the present value of the lost income during his 4-year college tenure and the total amount of loans he incurred.

First, let's calculate the present value of the lost income:
The annual lost income is $25,000, and the duration is 4 years. We can use the present value formula:

PV = FV / (1 + r)^n

where PV is the present value, FV is the future value ($0 in this case), r is the annual interest rate (assuming 0% for simplicity), and n is the number of years.

PV = $25,000 / (1 + 0)^4
PV = $25,000

Since the lost income is not compounded, the present value is equal to the future value.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of loans:
Jim incurred $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, so the total amount of loans is:
$50,000 x 4 = $200,000

Now, we need to find the break-even point, which is the point at which Jim's total income equals the total amount of loans and the present value of the lost income. Let's denote the break-even point as x years.

The total income after x years is $75,000x (since his income triples after college). The total amount of loans and the present value of the lost income remain constant.

We can set up the equation:

$75,000x = $200,000 + $25,000

Simplifying the equation:

$75,000x = $225,000

Dividing both sides by $75,000:

x = 3

Therefore, it would take Jim approximately 3 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school.

Final answer: 3"
"To determine the total amount of fabric needed, we must calculate the area of the comforter. Given the bed's dimensions, we can find the dimensions of the fabric by adding 2 feet to both the length and width of the bed.

The bed measures 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Therefore, the fabric will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of the fabric can be calculated using the formula for the area of a rectangle:

Area = Length x Width
Area = 8 x 10
Area = 80 square feet

To ensure accuracy, let's verify this calculation by using the formula for the area of a rectangle:

Area = Length x Width
Area = (6 + 2) x (8 + 2)
Area = 8 x 10
Area = 80 square feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we can break down the problem into three separate calculations.

First, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday, which is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Tuesday's delivery = (1/5) × Monday's delivery + 17
= (1/5) × 425 + 17
= 85 + 17
= 102

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday, which is 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Wednesday's delivery = 2 × Tuesday's delivery + 5
= 2 × 102 + 5
= 204 + 5
= 209

Now, we add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:

Total delivery = Monday's delivery + Tuesday's delivery + Wednesday's delivery
= 425 + 102 + 209
= 736

The final answer is: $\boxed{736}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the catering, we can apply the principle of multiplication to determine the cost of each type of salad and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person, which can be expressed as 10 × $6.50. This calculation yields a total of $65.

Similarly, the cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person, which can be expressed as 6 × $6. This calculation yields a total of $36.

To find the overall cost, we add the two totals together: $65 + $36 = $101.

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To determine the average amount lost, we must first calculate the total amount lost. 

In the first race, Johnny lost $5. 

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average amount lost, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17

The average amount lost that day is $7.17."
"To calculate the total population of South America, we can employ a straightforward multiplication of the given values. 

The number of countries in South America is 26, and each country has 5 cities with a population of 1000 people. 

The total population can be calculated as follows:

Total population = Number of countries * Number of cities in each country * Population of each city
Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000

Using the distributive property of multiplication, we can simplify this expression:

Total population = (26 * 5) * 1000
Total population = 130 * 1000
Total population = 130,000

Therefore, the total population of South America is 130,000.

The final answer is: 130,000"
"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we can calculate their new heights and then subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height.

Xavier's new height is 4 feet 3 inches, which can be converted to inches as follows: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot + 3 inches = 51 inches.

Cole's new height is 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

Now, we can find the difference in height by subtracting Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

Therefore, the difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 1 inch."
"To determine the share of the first person, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount the first person took as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 1760/3

x = 586.67

Therefore, the first person's share is $586.67.

The final answer is: $586.67"
"To determine the total hours worked by each painter, we must first calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since the team worked 3/8 of a day every day for 3 weeks, we can calculate the total hours worked as follows:

3/8 of a day is equivalent to 3/8 * 24 hours = 9 hours per day.

Since the team worked for 3 weeks, we multiply the daily hours by 7 days:
9 hours/day * 7 days = 63 hours

Now, we divide the total hours by the number of painters:
63 hours ÷ 4 painters = 15.75 hours per painter

The final answer is: $\boxed{15.75}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

The number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4, and in the third set is x/2. The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply the entire equation by 2:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final answer is: 10"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the price of a car after a constant annual depreciation rate. This is a classic example of exponential decay, where the value of the car decreases by a fixed percentage each year.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for exponential decay:

A(t) = A0 * (1 - r)^t

where:
- A(t) is the value of the car at time t
- A0 is the initial value of the car (in this case, $20,000)
- r is the annual depreciation rate (21% or 0.21 as a decimal)
- t is the number of years

We want to find the value of the car in 2010, which is 3 years after the initial purchase. Plugging in the values, we get:

A(3) = 20,000 * (1 - 0.21)^3
A(3) = 20,000 * (0.79)^3
A(3) = 20,000 * 0.631519
A(3) = 12,638.38

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $12,638.38.

12,638.38"
"To determine the number of Spanish books, we can calculate the total number of non-Spanish books first. 

We know that 50% of the books are written in English, which is equivalent to 0.5 or 1/2 of the total. Therefore, the number of English books is 50 * 0.5 = 25.

Additionally, 10% of the books are written in German, which is equivalent to 0.1 or 1/10 of the total. Therefore, the number of German books is 50 * 0.1 = 5.

The total number of non-Spanish books is the sum of English and German books, which is 25 + 5 = 30.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the remaining distance Bernice needs to drive, we can employ the concept of subtraction. The total distance between San Diego, California, and New York City, New York, is 1955 kilometers. Bernice has already covered a distance of 325 kilometers.

Let's perform the calculation:

Total distance - Distance driven = Remaining distance
1955 km - 325 km = 1630 km

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

Final answer: 1630"
"To calculate the total gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we can utilize the conversion factor of 16 cups per gallon. 

First, we multiply the daily water consumption (8 cups) by the number of days (30) to obtain the total cups of water consumed in 30 days: 

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Next, we divide the total cups by the conversion factor (16 cups/gallon) to determine the total gallons:

240 cups ÷ 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"To calculate the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we can break down the sequence of events as follows:

Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, increasing the total to 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and 100 people board the train. The net change is -50 + 100 = 50, so the total becomes 140 + 50 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train, decreasing the total to 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

Final answer: $\boxed{110}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the athletic gear, we can break down the costs as follows:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add the costs together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

Therefore, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the total cost of the tiles, we must first calculate the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. 

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet. To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area by the area of each tile: 

Area of kitchen floor / Area of each tile = Total number of tiles
200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile to find the total cost:
Total number of tiles * Cost per tile = Total cost
200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

Therefore, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To calculate the increased cost, we can use the formula: 

Increased Cost = Normal Cost + (Normal Cost x Percentage Increase)

Given:
Normal Cost = $120
Percentage Increase = 60%

Plugging in the values, we get:

Increased Cost = $120 + ($120 x 0.6)
= $120 + $72
= $192

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

Yearly Cost = $192 x 12
= $2304

Therefore, James pays $2304 per year for the increased insurance cost."
"To determine the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we can break down the problem into two parts: twin beds and the king size bed.

For the twin beds, Greg puts clean sheets on 4 beds per week. Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, he does 4 / 2 = 2 loads per week for the twin beds.

For the king size bed, Greg puts clean sheets on 1 bed per week. Since his laundry machine can wash 1 king set at a time, he does 1 load per week for the king size bed.

The total number of loads per week is the sum of the twin bed loads and the king bed loads: 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

To find the total number of loads per year, we multiply the total number of loads per week by 52: 3 * 52 = 156 loads per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To determine the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks, we must first establish the weekly movie-watching pattern. On Saturdays, Jill and her friends watch 4 movies. On Sundays, they watch half the number of movies on Saturdays, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

The total number of movies watched in one weekend is the sum of the movies watched on Saturday and Sunday, which is 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

To find the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies watched in one weekend by 4. This gives us 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

Therefore, Jill and her friends can watch 24 movies in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we'll calculate the number of stickers Leo had two years ago, which is given as 100. Then, we'll add the 50 stickers he collected last year. 

The total number of stickers Leo had after the first two years is 100 + 50 = 150.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, we'll add the stickers from all three years: 100 + 150 + 100 = 350.

Therefore, Leo has 350 stickers in his collection."
"To determine the number of days the cat food will last, we can use a simple division operation. 

Let's calculate the number of days:

Total cat food available = 720 grams
Daily cat food consumption = 60 grams

Number of days = Total cat food available / Daily cat food consumption
= 720 grams / 60 grams/day
= 12 days

Therefore, the cat food will last for 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as x. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can express Becky's slices as x + 3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so we can represent Silvia's slices as 2x.

We are given that Becky ate 10 slices, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3 = 10

Solving for x, we get:

x = 7

Now that we know Jake ate 7 slices, we can find Silvia's slices:

Silvia's slices = 2x
Silvia's slices = 2(7)
Silvia's slices = 14

The total number of slices they ate can be found by adding up the slices each of them ate:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = (x + 3) + x + 2x
Total slices = 4x + 3
Total slices = 4(7) + 3
Total slices = 28 + 3
Total slices = 31

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To solve this linear equation, we can employ the fundamental principles of algebra. Let's denote Donovan's part as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as x + 18.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtracting 18 from both sides yields:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2, we obtain:

x = 40

Now that we have found Donovan's part, we can determine Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:

Betsy's part = x + 18
= 40 + 18
= 58

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to consider the various charges incurred. 

First, let's break down the costs:

- The cost of the cast is a fixed amount of $200.
- The cost of the visit is calculated as $300 per hour multiplied by the number of hours spent, which is 0.5 hours (since the visit is 30 minutes). This can be expressed as $300 * 0.5 = $150.
- The cost of the painkillers is $4 per pill, and 30 pills were prescribed. This can be calculated as $4 * 30 = $120.
- The cost of parking is $6 per hour, and the minimum required is 2 hours. This can be calculated as $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add these costs together: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To calculate the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we can use the concept of percentages and basic arithmetic.

First, we need to find the number of emails that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require a response, we can calculate this as 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails.

The remaining emails that require a response are 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

To find the total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we can multiply the number of emails he responds to per day (64) by the number of days in a work week (5).

The total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To calculate the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we can employ the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

First, we'll calculate the number of classes that visited each day:

- On Monday, 32 classes visited.
- On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 × 32 = 64 classes visited.
- On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 × 32 = 96 classes visited.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the total number of classes that visited:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

Therefore, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To calculate the average score, we can utilize the formula for the arithmetic mean: 

Average = (Sum of all scores) / (Number of scores)

In this scenario, the sum of all scores is 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380. The number of scores is 4.

Average = 380 / 4
Average = 95

Therefore, the average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by each group and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which can be calculated as 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

Therefore, the number of pizzas left is 14."
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total cost of postage for a pizza parlor's coupon distribution. To approach this, we must first determine the number of small and big coupons being sent out.

Let's denote the number of small coupons as S and the number of big coupons as B. We are given that S = 700 and B = 2S. 

The cost of mailing a small coupon is 5 cents, and the cost of mailing a big coupon is 15 cents. The total cost of postage can be calculated using the formula:

Total Cost = (S * 5) + (B * 15)

Substituting the given values, we get:

Total Cost = (700 * 5) + (2 * 700 * 15)
Total Cost = 3500 + 21000
Total Cost = 24500 cents

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100:

Total Cost = 245 dollars

Therefore, the total cost of postage is 245 dollars."
"To determine the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we must consider the sequence of events that unfolded.

Initially, Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Mark then consumed 4 of these, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches. Subsequently, Sidney ordered an additional 3 sub sandwiches, bringing the total to 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches can be calculated as 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To calculate the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we need to determine the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser and multiply it by the amount each truck carried.

Initially, 20 trucks were dispatched, and a quarter of them experienced mechanical failures. This means 20 - (1/4 * 20) = 20 - 5 = 15 trucks successfully delivered the fertiliser.

Each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser delivered is:
15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons

The total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To determine the cost of purchasing 6 pounds of butter, we must first calculate the total amount of butter required. Since Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, the total amount of butter required is 6 x 1 = 6 pounds.

Given the promotion, for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis pays for 1.5 pounds. To find the total cost, we can divide the total amount of butter required (6 pounds) by 2, which equals 3. This indicates that Dennis needs to purchase 3 sets of 2 pounds of butter.

Since each set costs $4.00, the total cost can be calculated as 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To calculate the total cost of the party, we need to determine the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20. 

The total number of guests is 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) - 4 (declined guests) = 41.

Since the initial fee is $125 for 20 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional 21 guests. 

The cost for additional guests = 21 * $6 = $126.

Total cost = Initial fee + Cost for additional guests = $125 + $126 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"To determine the initial amount of money Maggie and Riza had, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of money they had as 'x'. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is 2x. We know that Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4x, and Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3x. The total amount they spent is 1/4x + 1/3x. We can simplify this expression by finding a common denominator, which is 12. 

(1/4x) + (1/3x) = (3/12x) + (4/12x) = 7/12x

We know that the total amount they spent is $35. So, we can set up the equation:

7/12x = 35

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 12/7:

x = 35 * (12/7)
x = 60

Since x represents the initial amount of money they had, we know that Maggie and Riza initially had $60 each.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the amount they spent from the initial amount:

Initial amount: $60 + $60 = $120
Total spent: 1/4 * $60 + 1/3 * $60 = $15 + $20 = $35
Amount left: $120 - $35 = $85

The two of them have $85 left."
"To determine the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can start by calculating the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a week. 

Let's denote the number of bananas the first monkey eats per day as x. Since the second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, the second monkey eats x + 4 bananas per day. 

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 7(x + x + 4). 

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas, which is 315 - 7(x + x + 4). 

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 7(x + x + 4) = 315 - 7(x + x + 4). 

Simplifying the equation, we get 14x + 28 = 315 - 14x - 28. 

Combine like terms: 28x + 28 = 315 - 14x. 

Add 14x to both sides: 42x + 28 = 315. 

Subtract 28 from both sides: 42x = 287. 

Divide both sides by 42: x = 287/42. 

x = 6.81 (round down to 6 since we can't have a fraction of a banana)

Now that we know the first monkey eats 6 bananas per day, the second monkey eats 6 + 4 = 10 bananas per day. 

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 7(6 + 10) = 7(16) = 112 bananas. 

The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas, which is 315 - 112 = 203 bananas. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, the third monkey eats 203/7 = 29 bananas per day.

The final answer is 29."
"To determine the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first half of the 500-piece puzzle and the second 500-piece puzzle.

First, we calculate the number of pieces in the first half of the 500-piece puzzle: 500 / 2 = 250 pieces.

Next, we add the number of pieces in the second puzzle: 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

Therefore, Teddy placed a total of 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To calculate the number of quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to first determine the total cost of the roses and then subtract that from the amount of money she has.

The cost of 15 roses can be calculated as follows:

15 roses * $2 each = $30
Since a dozen (12) roses costs $15, we can also calculate the cost of the remaining 3 roses:
3 roses * $2 each = $6
Total cost of roses = $30 + $6 = $36

Jenny has 5 $5 bills, which is equal to 5 * $5 = $25. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of roses from the total amount of money she has:

Change = Total amount of money - Total cost of roses
= $25 - $36
= -$11

Since Jenny is short $11, she will not have enough money to buy the roses. However, if we assume she has enough money, we can calculate the change:

Change = Total amount of money - Total cost of roses
= $25 - $36
= -$11

Since she is short $11, we need to find out how many quarters she can get with $11:

$11 / $0.25 (quarter) = 44 quarters

However, since she is short $11, she will not have enough quarters to cover the cost of the roses."
"To calculate the total amount of money Terry makes, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. 

First, we multiply the quantity of each item by its respective price and then sum the results. 

Milkshakes: 6 * $5.50 = $33
Burger platters: 9 * $11 = $99
Sodas: 20 * $1.50 = $30

Now, we add the individual totals together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162

Therefore, the total amount of money Terry makes is $162."
"To calculate the total waiting time for Paul, we need to analyze the train schedule and determine the time intervals between each train's arrival and departure.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. The time from the first train's arrival to its departure is 20 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the time from the second train's arrival to its departure is 5 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes after the first train's arrival. The third train leaves immediately after its arrival, so its departure time is the same as its arrival time, 60 minutes after the first train's arrival.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 20 minutes after 60 minutes, or 80 minutes after the first train's arrival.

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:

Total waiting time = Waiting for the first train + Waiting for the second train + Waiting for the third train + Waiting for the fourth train
= 10 + (30 + 20) + 60 + 80
= 10 + 50 + 60 + 80
= 200 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks, we can use the concept of unit rates. 

First, we need to find the rate at which Melanie saves toothpicks per week. This can be calculated by dividing the number of toothpicks she has saved (120) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12).

Rate = Number of toothpicks saved / Number of weeks saved
Rate = 120 toothpicks / 12 weeks
Rate = 10 toothpicks/week

Now, we can use this rate to find the number of weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks. We know that she needs 80 more toothpicks, so we can divide this by the rate to find the number of weeks.

Number of weeks = Number of toothpicks needed / Rate
Number of weeks = 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week
Number of weeks = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the difference between the original price and the sale price, and then divide by the original price.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find the original price. Since Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, we can set up the equation:

Original price * 0.75 = $2000

To find the original price, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

Original price = $2000 / 0.75
Original price = $2666.67

2. Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. We can set up the equation:

Sale price = Original price * 1.20
Sale price = $2666.67 * 1.20
Sale price = $3200

3. To find the percentage discount, we can calculate the difference between the original price and the sale price, and then divide by the original price:

Discount = Original price - Sale price
Discount = $2666.67 - $3200
Discount = -$533.33

Since we're looking for the percentage discount, we'll divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:

Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100
Percentage discount = (-$533.33 / $2666.67) * 100
Percentage discount = -20%

However, since the question asks for the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to consider the sale price as the new base price. The correct calculation is:

Percentage discount = (Original price - Sale price) / Original price * 100
Percentage discount = ($2666.67 - $3200) / $2666.67 * 100
Percentage discount = -20%

But, since the sale price is higher than the original price, we can rephrase the calculation to find the percentage increase:

Percentage increase = (Sale price - Original price) / Original price * 100
Percentage increase = ($3200 - $2666.67) / $2666.67 * 100
Percentage increase = 20%

Therefore, Mr. Rogers' friend paid 20% more than the original price.

Final answer: 20"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total number of jellyfish created by multiple springs working at the same rate. To approach this, we can utilize the concept of exponential growth, as each spring creates a new jellyfish every second.

First, we need to determine the rate at which a single spring creates jellyfish. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, a spring creates 60 * 60 = 3600 jellyfish in one hour. 

To find the number of jellyfish created in 4 hours, we multiply the hourly rate by 4: 3600 * 4 = 14400 jellyfish.

Now, if 5 springs are working at the same rate, we can multiply the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours by 5: 14400 * 5 = 72000 jellyfish.

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

Final answer: $\boxed{72000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can represent Frankie's score as 'F' and Binkie's score as 'B'. We are given that Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's. This can be written as an equation:

F = 2B + 15

We are also given that Binkie's score is 90. We can substitute this value into the equation:

F = 2(90) + 15
F = 180 + 15
F = 195

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked halfway, that's 2 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 0.5 hours

Since he walked back home, the total distance is 2 miles (to the store) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

The total time it took James to reach the store is 0.5 hours (to the store) + 1 hour (back home) = 1.5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.5}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we can calculate the total cost of each option and then find the difference.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually is 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as x. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, we can express Harry's share as x + 60.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtracting 60 from both sides yields:

2x = 40

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 20

Now that we have determined Sam's share, we can calculate the amount left over for Sam by subtracting his share from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

Therefore, the amount left over for Sam is 80 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the total growth of the crocodile in 13 years, we can utilize the concept of uniform linear growth. Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can establish a growth rate of 2 inches per year.

The formula for uniform linear growth is:

Total growth = growth rate * number of years

Substituting the given values, we get:

Total growth = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To calculate Marcel's total earnings, we can break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold:
Number of Trekking bikes = Total bikes * 0.5
= 300 * 0.5
= 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold:
Number of BMX bikes = Total bikes * 0.15
= 300 * 0.15
= 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold:
Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - (Number of Trekking bikes + Number of BMX bikes)
= 300 - (150 + 45)
= 300 - 195
= 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes * Price of a Trekking bike
= 150 * 450
= $67,500

Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes * Price of a BMX bike
= 45 * 250
= $11,250

Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes * Price of an MTB
= 105 * 500
= $52,500

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
= $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500
= $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

Let's consider the rate at which the farmer and the truck operate. The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, while the truck collects 3 bales per hour. 

The combined rate at which the farmer and the truck operate is 5 + 3 = 8 bales per hour. 

In a 6-hour period, the total number of bales produced and collected is 8 * 6 = 48. 

Since the farmer and the truck are working together, we can assume that the total number of bales produced and collected is equal to the initial amount of hay in the field. 

Therefore, the initial amount of hay in the field is 48. 

Since the farmer and the truck are working together, we can conclude that there are no bales of hay left in the field.

The correct answer is: $\boxed{0}$"
"To calculate the total hours John spends learning per week, we need to consider his class schedule and additional learning time.

First, we calculate the total minutes he spends in class per week. He attends 5 classes per day, with each class lasting 40 minutes. Therefore, the total minutes spent in class per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes spent in class per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Next, we need to account for the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days. To find this amount, we calculate 1/16 of 1000 minutes: 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

Now, we add the total minutes spent in class and the extra minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday: 1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 1062.5 / 60 = 17.6883 hours.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total hours John spends learning per week is 17.69 hours.

The final answer is 17.69."
"To determine the height of the ball on its second bounce, we must first calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce. 

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is equivalent to 3 x 24 feet. 

The ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, so we can express this as (2/3) * 3 * 24 feet.

To simplify the expression, we can first multiply 3 and 24, which equals 72. Then, we multiply 72 by 2/3, which is equivalent to (2/3) * 72.

To multiply a whole number by a fraction, we can multiply the whole number by the numerator and then divide by the denominator. So, (2/3) * 72 = (2 * 72) / 3 = 144 / 3 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball will bounce to 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 feet.

To simplify the expression, we can first multiply 48 and 2, which equals 96. Then, we divide 96 by 3, which equals 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball will go 32 feet on its second bounce.

The final answer is 32."
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we must first convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height of the first child is 6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches.

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To calculate the total earnings, we can utilize the formula for calculating revenue, which is the product of the number of units sold and the price per unit. In this scenario, the number of units sold is 2000 apples, and the price per unit is $5.

Revenue = Number of units sold * Price per unit
= 2000 * $5
= $10,000

Therefore, the orchard earned $10,000 for selling 2000 apples.

The final answer is $10,000."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of equivalent ratios. Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as x kilograms.

The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the triceratops, which means the velociraptors ate half of the remaining half. This can be represented as:

x / 2 = (x / 2) / 2

To simplify, we can multiply both sides by 2:

x = (x / 2) / 2
x = x / 4

Now, we know that the velociraptors ate 270 kilograms, which is half of the remaining half. We can set up the equation:

x / 4 = 270

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 270 * 4
x = 1080

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

Final answer: 1080"
"To determine the total cost of painting the room, we must first calculate the total surface area of the walls. The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so their combined area is 2 * (10 * 8) = 160 square feet. The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so their combined area is 2 * (5 * 8) = 80 square feet. The total surface area of the four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we can calculate the number of gallons needed by dividing the total surface area by 20: 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 * $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To calculate the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the total number of sodas left and the number of shaken sodas.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas out of a total of 12. This leaves 9 unshaken sodas. Her brother then took 1 shaken soda, leaving 2 shaken sodas. 

Now, there is 1 shaken soda left. Ellen's friend will get sprayed with soda from a shaken can if the shaken soda is the one left. 

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 1 out of the total number of sodas left, which is 1 (shaken soda) + 9 (unshaken sodas) = 10.

This can be expressed as a probability fraction: 1/10.

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/10) × 100 = 10%.

The final answer is: 10%"
"To determine the distance between the two trains, we can apply the fundamental principles of distance, rate, and time. Given that one train is traveling at 60 miles per hour and the other at half that speed, we can calculate their individual distances traveled in 3 hours.

The distance traveled by the first train is calculated as the product of its rate and time:
Distance = Rate × Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

Similarly, the distance traveled by the second train is:
Distance = 30 miles/hour × 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we can find the total distance between them by adding their individual distances:
Total Distance = Distance traveled by Train 1 + Distance traveled by Train 2
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To calculate the total number of people Billy can help, we need to determine the number of days he is available to work and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per day.

March has 31 days, and Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find the number of days he is available, we can calculate 20% of 31 and subtract it from 31.

20% of 31 = 0.2 * 31 = 6.2

Since we cannot have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

Billy is available to work for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the total number of people inside the church, we must consider the capacity of both the buses and the cars. 

First, we calculate the total number of people in the buses: 12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people. 

Next, we calculate the total number of people in the cars: 20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people.

The total number of people inside the church is the sum of the people in buses and cars: 420 + 60 = 480 people.

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To solve this problem, we can represent the ages of Jeff, Martha, and Mike as variables: 

Let J = Jeff's age
M = Martha's age
M = Mike's age

We are given the following information:

1. J = M + 10 (Jeff is 10 years older than Martha)
2. M = 24 - 4 (Martha is 4 years younger than Mike)

We can substitute the value of M from the second equation into the first equation:

J = (24 - 4) + 10
J = 20 + 10
J = 30

Therefore, Jeff's age is 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the time difference between the two waterslides, we can calculate the time it takes to ride each slide and then find the difference.

The time for the biggest slide is given by the formula: time = distance / speed
time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

Similarly, the time for the second biggest slide is: time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

The difference in time is then: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

Therefore, the biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest slide.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we can simply add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours by dividing by 60:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Now, we multiply the total time per day by the number of days (5) to find the total time spent:
1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the distance run by Ahito, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the distance run by Ahito as 'x'. We know that the total distance run by all three individuals is 52 miles, and Amber ran 8 miles. Additionally, Micah ran 3.5 times the distance run by Amber.

We can set up the following equation:

8 + 3.5A + x = 52

Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance run by Amber, we can rewrite the equation as:

8 + 3.5A + x = 52

We also know that A = 8 (Amber's distance). Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

8 + 3.5(8) + x = 52

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 + 28 + x = 52

Combine like terms:

36 + x = 52

Subtract 36 from both sides:

x = 16

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles.

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we must calculate the total cost of the items purchased after applying the respective discounts.

First, we'll calculate the discount on the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount percentage: 20%
Discount amount: 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Price after discount: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, we'll calculate the discount on the set of towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount percentage: 10%
Discount amount: 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Price after discount: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
$15.00 (returned item) + $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $58.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. The new balance will be:
$85.00 - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00
$70.00 + $58.00 (new purchases) = $128.00

The new balance on her credit card is $128.00."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as x.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of the large jellyfish change color, which means the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are also given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are large and change color. Since x/15 jellyfish change color, we can set up the equation x/15 = 6 to find the total number of jellyfish.

Multiplying both sides of the equation by 15, we get x = 6 * 15 = 90.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine Caroline's age, we can utilize the given information in a step-by-step manner. 

First, we know Chris is 4 years old. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age by multiplying Chris's age by 2: 2 * 4 = 8. 

Next, Caroline is three times older than Ben, so we multiply Ben's age by 3 to find Caroline's age: 3 * 8 = 24.

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of years Lauren needs to work to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we must first calculate her annual savings and annual expenses.

Lauren's current annual salary is $100,000. She saves 20% of her income, which is $20,000 per year. She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, this is a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. It seems there might be a mistake in the question. Assuming the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income and spends 40% of her income, we can proceed.

Lauren's annual savings as a percentage of her income is $20,000 / $100,000 = 0.20 or 20% of her income.

To find the total amount she needs to save for 20 years, we can multiply her annual savings by the number of years she wants to save for. However, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save, not the amount she needs to work for. Since she saves 20% of her income, we can calculate her annual expenses as 40% of her income.

40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, we can calculate the amount she saves as a percentage of her income.

$20,000 / $100,000 = 0.20 or 20% of her income.

Since she saves 20% of her income, we can calculate her annual savings as $20,000.

To find the total amount she needs to save, we can calculate her annual savings and multiply it by the number of years she wants to save for.

However, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save, not the amount she needs to work for. Since she saves 20% of her income, we can calculate her annual savings and multiply it by the number of years she wants to save for.

Let's assume she wants to save $X for 20 years. Since she saves 20% of her income, we can set up the equation:

$20,000 * 20 = X

$400,000 = X

However, this is the amount she needs to save, not the amount she needs to work for. To find the number of years she needs to work, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings.

$400,000 / $20,000 = 20 years.

However, this is the number of years she needs to save, not the number of years she needs to work. Since she saves 20% of her income, she will need to work for the same amount of time to earn the same amount.

To find the number of years she needs to work, we can calculate her annual income and divide it by her annual savings.

40% of $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

$100,000 / $20,000 = 5 years.

Since she needs to work for 5 years to earn $100,000, she will need to work for 5 years to save $400,000.

Final Answer: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the length of each final cut, we can apply the concept of successive divisions. 

First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). This yields 25 cm per part.

Next, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5). This results in 25 cm ÷ 5 = 5 cm per final cut.

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total number of students in the school, we can use the concept of percentages. Since 40% of the students are boys, we can set up the equation:

0.4x = 240

where x represents the total number of students. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 600, and the number of girls is 360.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To calculate the total amount spent by your mom at the gardening shop, we need to apply the concept of subtraction with a discount. 

The total cost of the items purchased is the sum of the cost of the pots and the cost of the soil. 

Cost of pots: $19
Cost of soil: $26
Total cost: $19 + $26 = $45

Now, we need to subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount spent.

Total amount spent = Total cost - Discount
Total amount spent = $45 - $7
Total amount spent = $38

Therefore, the total amount spent by your mom at the gardening shop is $38."
"To calculate the average height of heels at the party, we need to find the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of women.

Let's denote the total height of heels as H and the total number of women as N. We know that 3 women are wearing 4-inch heels and 3 women are wearing 2-inch heels. 

We can express the total height of heels as the sum of the heights of the heels worn by each group of women: H = (3 * 4) + (3 * 2).

Using the distributive property, we can simplify the expression: H = 12 + 6.

Now, we can calculate the total height: H = 18 inches.

Next, we need to divide the total height by the total number of women: Average height = H / N = 18 / 6.

Simplifying the expression, we get: Average height = 3 inches.

The average height of heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To determine the additional miles Soledad needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time, we can calculate the difference between the total miles she wants to hike (9,300) and the miles she plans to hike per day (125). 

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Total miles / Total days = Miles per day

We know the total miles (9,300) and the total days (30), but we want to find the miles per day. However, we also know that Soledad plans to hike 125 miles per day. 

Let's first calculate the total miles she can hike in 30 days at 125 miles per day:

125 miles/day * 30 days = 3,750 miles

Since she wants to hike 9,300 miles in total, we can subtract the miles she can hike in 30 days from the total miles:

9,300 miles - 3,750 miles = 5,550 miles

Now, we can divide the remaining miles by the total days to find the additional miles she needs to hike per day:

5,550 miles / 30 days = 185 miles/day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The correct answer is: $\boxed{185}$"
"To calculate the total amount the store will receive, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic series. 

First, let's calculate the total revenue from each color of balls:

Red balls: 3 * $9 = $27
Blue balls: 11 * $5 = $55
Green balls: 25 * $3 = $75

Now, we can sum these values to determine the total revenue:

$27 + $55 + $75 = $157

Therefore, the store will receive a total of $157 after all the balls are sold."
"To determine the amount of apples left for Jacques, we need to calculate the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul. 

Pierre's share is 1/4 of 12 kg, which can be calculated as 12 * (1/4) = 12 * 0.25 = 3 kg.

Paul's share is 1/3 of 12 kg, which can be calculated as 12 * (1/3) = 12 * (4/12) = 4 kg.

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

Since the total amount of apples initially available is 12 kg, the amount left for Jacques is 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the temperature in the morning, we can apply the concept of temperature change. The initial temperature was 2 degrees Celsius, and it dropped by 8 degrees Celsius overnight. This means the temperature became 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius.

Then, the temperature increased by 3 degrees Celsius in the morning. To find the final temperature, we add the increase to the temperature after the drop: -6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius.

Therefore, the temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius.

Final answer: $\boxed{-3}$"
"To determine the amount of money Raymond has left, we can apply the principle of subtraction. 

Initially, Raymond had $21. He then added $11 to this amount, resulting in a total of $21 + $11 = $32. After spending $5 on a comic book, the new total is $32 - $5 = $27. Finally, after spending $19 on a puzzle, the amount of money Raymond has left is $27 - $19 = $8.

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left.

"To determine the cost of each book, we can utilize the concept of division. Given that Anna spent a total of $10 on the books and she purchased two identical items, we can calculate the cost of each book by dividing the total expenditure by the number of items.

Let's denote the cost of each book as x. We can set up the equation:

2x = 10

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 10 ÷ 2
x = 5

Therefore, the cost of each book is $5.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year, we can apply the concept of percentage increase. The formula for finding the new value after a percentage increase is:

New Value = Old Value + (Old Value x Percentage Increase)

In this case, the old value is 50 (the number of students last year), and the percentage increase is 20%. We can express the percentage as a decimal by dividing by 100: 20/100 = 0.20.

New Value = 50 + (50 x 0.20)
= 50 + 10
= 60

Therefore, the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year is 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we can establish a ratio of blinks to time. Given that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can express this as a ratio:

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute

Now, we can use this ratio to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times:

Time = Total blinks / Blinks per minute
Time = 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute
Time = 9 minutes

Therefore, it will take the light approximately 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

"To determine the difference between the number of female and male fish, we must first calculate the total number of each type of fish.

The initial number of male guppies is 4, and Tate buys 2 more, resulting in a total of 4 + 2 = 6 male guppies. The initial number of female guppies is 7, and Tate buys 1 more, resulting in a total of 7 + 1 = 8 female guppies.

The initial number of male goldfishes is 3, and Tate buys 2 more, resulting in a total of 3 + 2 = 5 male goldfishes. The initial number of female goldfishes is 5, and Tate buys 3 more, resulting in a total of 5 + 3 = 8 female goldfishes.

Now, we can calculate the difference between the total number of female and male fish. The total number of male fish is 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfish) = 11. The total number of female fish is 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfish) = 16.

The difference between the total number of female and male fish is 16 - 11 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To calculate the total time taken by Amalia, Megan, and Dior to complete their chores, we can break down the problem into individual components.

First, we know that Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn. Since Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, her time can be represented as 4 + 2 = 6 hours. 

Next, we need to determine Dior's time, which is over 4 hours longer than Amalia's time. This can be expressed as 4 + 4 = 8 hours.

Now, we can add up the time each person took to complete their chores:

4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours

Therefore, the total time taken by all three individuals to complete their chores is 18 hours."
"To determine the total distance driven in a month, we must consider the round-trip distance and the frequency of visits. 

First, we calculate the one-way distance: 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, we multiply this by 2 to obtain the total round-trip distance: 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Now, we multiply the round-trip distance by the number of visits per month to find the total distance driven: 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{560}$"
"To determine the distance Brian will walk in 7 days, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can establish a proportion to find Brian's daily walking distance.

Let's denote Brian's daily walking distance as x. The proportion can be set up as follows:

Sofie's daily distance / Brian's daily distance = 2
10 / x = 2

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

10 = 2x
x = 10 / 2
x = 5

Now that we know Brian's daily walking distance, we can calculate the total distance he walks in 7 days:

Brian's total distance = 5 miles/day * 7 days
= 35 miles

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."
"To solve this problem, we can start by calculating the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers. 

Let's denote the number of toys produced by the fifth worker as x. The total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 220. We can set up the equation:

2(6)(10) + 2(4)(10) + x(10) = 220

Simplifying the equation, we get:

120 + 80 + 10x = 220

Combine like terms:

200 + 10x = 220

Subtract 200 from both sides:

10x = 20

Divide both sides by 10:

x = 2

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 2 toys per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we can break down the problem into two parts. 

First, we need to find the weight of Elijah's dogs. Since Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, we can express this as a fraction: 1/4 * 60. To calculate this, we multiply 60 by 1/4, which is equivalent to dividing 60 by 4.

60 ÷ 4 = 15

So, Elijah's first dog weighs 15 pounds. 

Next, we need to find the weight of Elijah's second dog, which is half the weight of Kory's dog. We can express this as a fraction: 1/2 * 60. To calculate this, we multiply 60 by 1/2, which is equivalent to dividing 60 by 2.

60 ÷ 2 = 30

So, Elijah's second dog weighs 30 pounds.

Now, we can add the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog to find the total weight:

15 (Elijah's first dog) + 30 (Elijah's second dog) + 60 (Kory's dog) = 105

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of stickers Seth had as 'x'. 

Since Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, Luis received x/2 stickers. 

It is given that Luis gave half of the stickers he received to Kris. Therefore, Kris received (x/2)/2 = x/4 stickers from Luis.

We are also given that Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 stickers to Rob. This implies that Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially. Since Kris received x/4 stickers from Luis, we can set up the equation:

x/4 = 16

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 16 * 4
x = 64

Therefore, Seth initially had 64 stickers.

The final answer is: 64"
"To determine the total number of small bags John can make, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's and then divide by the number of M&M's per small bag.

First, we calculate the total number of M&M's: 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's.

Next, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag = 90 bags.

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M's.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To calculate the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can employ the fundamental concept of division.

Given that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can determine the number of days required to cover half of the earth's circumference by dividing the total distance by his daily distance.

Let's perform the calculation:

Distance to fly = 40,000 km (half of the earth's circumference)
Daily distance = 400 km

Number of days = Distance to fly ÷ Daily distance
= 40,000 km ÷ 400 km
= 100

Therefore, it will take Alfie 100 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is 100."
"To determine the speed of the faster car, we can utilize the given ratios and the average speed of the average car. 

Let's denote the speed of the average car as A, the speed of the 2nd fastest car as B, and the speed of the faster car as C. We are given that B = 5A and C = 1.25B.

Substituting B = 5A into the equation C = 1.25B, we get C = 1.25(5A) = 6.25A.

Given that A = 120 Miles per hour, we can substitute this value into the equation C = 6.25A to find the speed of the faster car.

C = 6.25 * 120
C = 750

Therefore, the speed of the faster car is 750 Miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Vince's current age as 'x'. Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so we can write the equation:

Liam's current age - 2 = 2 * (Vince's current age - 2)

Substituting Liam's current age as 16, we get:

16 - 2 = 2x - 4

Simplifying the equation:

14 = 2x - 4

Adding 4 to both sides:

18 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 9

Therefore, Vince's current age is 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We are given the following information:

1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can rewrite the second equation as S = 30 - C. Substituting this into the third equation, we get C = (30 - C) + 12. Simplifying this, we get C = 42 - C. Adding C to both sides, we get 2C = 42. Dividing both sides by 2, we get C = 21.

Now that we know C = 21, we can find S by substituting this value into the equation S = 30 - C. This gives us S = 30 - 21 = 9.

Next, we can find A by using the equation A = M. Since A = M, we can substitute S = 9 into the equation A + M + C + S = 56. This gives us A + A + 21 + 9 = 56. Simplifying this, we get 2A + 30 = 56. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2A = 26. Dividing both sides by 2, we get A = 13.

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted by subtracting A from C: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we can break down the problem into two parts: the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is:

Weight of crayons = Number of crayons * Weight of each crayon
= 200 * 1
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of crayons to pounds:

Weight of crayons (in pounds) = Weight of crayons (in ounces) / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

Next, we need to find the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes. So, the total weight of the boxes is:

Weight of boxes = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Converting the weight of boxes to pounds:

Weight of boxes (in pounds) = Weight of boxes (in ounces) / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

Now, we can find the total weight of the crayons and boxes by adding their individual weights:

Total weight = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To calculate the total earnings, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we find the total length of wood that can be used to make logs. Since John can make logs from 80% of the 80-foot tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet:

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet, the number of logs John can make is:

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we determine the total number of planks by multiplying the number of logs by 5:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of planks by the selling price per plank:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

Therefore, John's total earnings are $96.

The final answer is: $96"
"To determine the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to first find their individual salaries.

Since Valerie earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, we can represent her brother's salary as 2x, where x is the unknown amount. Therefore, Valerie's salary is 1/2 * 2x = x.

We know that Valerie's salary is $5000, so we can set up the equation x = $5000. Solving for x, we find that x = $5000.

Now that we know her brother's salary is 2x, which is 2 * $5000 = $10,000, and Valerie's salary is $5000, we can find their combined salary: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her salary is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is the sum of their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the time spent walking on the beach and the time spent walking on the sidewalk.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as x miles per hour. Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach, the time spent walking on the beach is:

Time on the beach = Distance / Speed
= 2 / x hours
= (2 / x) * 60 minutes
= 120 / x minutes

We are given that 40 minutes are spent walking on the beach, so we can set up the equation:

120 / x = 40

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by x:

120 = 40x

Divide both sides by 40:

x = 3

Now that we know the speed on the beach, we can find the speed on the sidewalk, which is twice the speed on the beach:

Speed on the sidewalk = 2x
= 2 * 3
= 6 miles per hour

The time spent walking on the sidewalk is:

Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed
= 1 / 6 hours
= (1 / 6) * 60 minutes
= 10 minutes

The total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent walking on the beach and the time spent walking on the sidewalk:

Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
= 40 + 10
= 50 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of additional weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we can use the concept of unitary method. 

Let's denote the number of additional weeks as 'x'. Since Jane saves $4 per week, the total amount she will save in 'x' weeks is $4x. We know that this amount should be equal to the remaining amount she needs to save, which is $60 - $32 = $28.

We can set up the equation: $4x = $28

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by $4:

x = $28 ÷ $4
x = 7

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

Final answer: 7"
"To determine the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can employ the principle of addition. 

We have three trees with 7 blue birds each, which can be represented as 3 × 7. This yields a total of 21 blue birds. Additionally, we have two trees with 4 blue birds each, contributing 2 × 4 = 8 blue birds. Lastly, there is one tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, we can calculate the total number of blue birds by adding these values: 21 + 8 + 3.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the situation. Let's denote the initial number of marbles Bob has as 'x'. According to the problem, if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. We can set up the equation:

x + 24 = 60

To solve for x, we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have after losing 10 marbles. We can do this by subtracting 10 from 36:

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given scenario. Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as x.

We know that Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, resulting in a total of 5 ounces of drinkable water. This can be represented by the equation:

4(33) + 1(x) = 5(x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

132 + x = 5x

Subtracting x from both sides:

132 = 4x

Dividing both sides by 4:

33 = x

However, this solution doesn't account for the fact that the average temperature of the water must be at least 40 degrees. To address this, we can set up an inequality:

(33 + x) / 2 >= 40

Multiplying both sides by 2:

33 + x >= 80

Subtracting 33 from both sides:

x >= 47

Since x represents the temperature of the second mug, we can conclude that the minimum temperature of the second mug is 47 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{47}$"
"To calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of cows and the number of chickens.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added per week: 20 cows/day * 7 days/week = 140 cows/week. Since there are 3 weeks, the total number of cows added is 140 cows/week * 3 weeks = 420 cows.

The initial number of cows was 50, so the total number of cows after 3 weeks is 50 + 420 = 470 cows.

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens added per week: 10 chickens/day * 7 days/week = 70 chickens/week. Since there are 3 weeks, the total number of chickens added is 70 chickens/week * 3 weeks = 210 chickens.

The initial number of chickens was 20, so the total number of chickens after 3 weeks is 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"To calculate the cost of each bagel after a 10% discount, we can use the formula:

Cost per bagel = Total cost / (1 - Discount percentage)

First, we need to convert the discount percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

Discount percentage = 10% = 0.10

Now, we can plug in the values:

Total cost = 4 packs * $10.00 per pack = $40.00
Discount = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Cost per bagel = $40.00 / (1 - 0.10)
= $40.00 / 0.90
= $44.44

However, since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to recalculate the cost per bagel using the correct formula:

Cost per bagel = Total cost / (1 + Discount percentage)
= $40.00 / (1 + 0.10)
= $40.00 / 1.10
= $36.36

The correct answer is: $36.36"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let's denote the number of scoops of mashed potatoes as 's' and the number of potatoes as 'p'. We are given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, so we can write an equation:

s = 23 - 5
s = 18

We are also given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be represented as:

p = 6 - 3
p = 3

Now, we know that 3 potatoes are needed for 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can set up a proportion to relate the number of scoops to the number of potatoes:

p / 2 = 3 / 2

Now, we can solve for p in terms of s:

p = (3/2)s

We can substitute the value of s into this equation:

p = (3/2)(18)
p = 27

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days.

Let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days: 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days: 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we'll add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

To convert the total number of eggs to dozens, we'll divide by 12: 240 eggs / 12 = 20.

Therefore, Chester needs 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of blue jellybeans as B, the number of green jellybeans as G, and the number of red jellybeans as R. We are given that G = 17 and R = 2G. The total number of jellybeans is 60, so we can set up the equation:

B + G + R = 60

Substituting the given values, we get:

B + 17 + 2(17) = 60

Combine like terms:

B + 17 + 34 = 60

Simplify:

B + 51 = 60

Subtract 51 from both sides:

B = 9

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To calculate the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we can utilize the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

First, we multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons per tree to determine the annual lemon yield. This can be expressed as:

5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Next, we multiply the annual yield by the number of years in a decade (10 years) to obtain the total lemon collection over the decade:

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

Therefore, Tim collects 300 lemons in a decade.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. 

Let's denote the number of men as 5x and the number of women as 9x. We know that the total number of passengers is 84, so we can set up the equation:

5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms:

14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14:

x = 6

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially:

Number of women = 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who have remained on the bus is:

Number of women remaining = 54 - 20 = 34

Therefore, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 34."
"To determine the total number of sunflowers sold, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of sunflowers sold as 's' and the number of bouquets sold as 'b'. We know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so the total number of sunflowers sold is 12b.

We are given that Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers and $56 from bouquets per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, the number of sunflowers sold can be represented as s = 26 / 2 = 13. 

We also know that each bouquet costs $8, so the number of bouquets sold can be represented as b = 56 / 8 = 7.

Now, we can set up the equation 12b = s, since the total number of sunflowers sold is equal to the number of bouquets sold multiplied by 12.

Substituting the values of b and s, we get 12(7) = 13, which is not true. However, we can re-evaluate the initial assumption that the number of sunflowers sold is 13.

Let's re-examine the information. We know that Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers and $56 from bouquets per day. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold can be represented as s = 26 / 2 = 13.

"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the total amount he earns from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks:
Adam buys 100 rocks at $5 each, so the total cost is:
$5 × 100 = $500

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 0.6 × 100 = 60 rocks.

He sells each rock for $7, so the total amount he earns is:
60 rocks × $7/rock = $420

Now, let's calculate the amount of money he loses:
$500 - $420 = $80

Therefore, Adam loses $80.

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the total number of days required to complete the project, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the days it takes to complete each type of picture scene.

First, let's find the LCM of 5, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 5 is 5.
The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations. Therefore, the LCM is 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 210.

Now, we divide the total number of each type of scene by the LCM to find the number of days required for each type of scene:

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 210 = 0.2143 (round up to 1 day, since we can't have a fraction of a day)
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 210 = 0.1714 (round up to 1 day)
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 210 = 0.2336 (round up to 1 day)

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number for each type of scene. However, we need to find the maximum number of days among these, which is 1 day.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 1 day to complete the project.

"To determine the number of eggs each child receives, we can utilize the concept of division. In this scenario, we have a total of 36 eggs (3 dozen) and 4 children. 

When dividing a quantity by a divisor, we aim to find the quotient, which represents the number of times the divisor fits into the quantity. In this case, we can express the division as:

36 ÷ 4 = 9

This calculation yields a quotient of 9, indicating that each child will receive 9 eggs."
"To calculate the total cost of food for Jen's fish in May, we must consider the number of days in the month and the daily cost of food per fish. 

May has 31 days, and each fish requires $1 worth of food per day. Therefore, the total cost for one fish for the entire month is:

31 days * $1/day = $31

Since Jen has 3 fish, the total cost for all of them for the entire month would be:

$31 * 3 = $93

This calculation is a straightforward application of the multiplication principle, which is a fundamental concept in arithmetic."
"To determine the current number of roses Patricia has, we can employ the principles of arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to subtract the number of roses given to her mother from the initial number of roses. This can be represented as:

Initial Roses - Roses Given to Mother = Roses Remaining

30 - 24 = 6

Next, we add the number of roses she bought to the remaining roses:

Roses Remaining + Roses Bought = Total Roses Now

6 + 15 = 21

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses.

Final answer: 21"
"To calculate the average speed, we must consider the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

First, we need to find the total distance traveled, which is the sum of the initial distance and the additional distance. 

Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, we need to find the total time taken, which is the sum of the initial time and the additional time. 

Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula: Average speed = Total distance / Total time

Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours

Average speed = 50 miles per hour

The final answer is 50."
"When calculating the probability of both events occurring, we must consider the independence of the events. In this case, the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other. Therefore, we can multiply the probabilities of each event.

The probability of the first ticket winning is 20%, or 0.2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities:

P(both tickets winning) = P(ticket 1 winning) * P(ticket 2 winning)
= 0.2 * 0.6
= 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

P(both tickets winning) = 0.12 * 100
= 12%

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey as C, J, and Y, respectively.

We are given that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. This can be represented by the equation:

J = C + 5

Substituting the given value of J, we get:

27 = C + 5

Solving for C, we find:

C = 22

We are also given that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. This can be represented by the equation:

C = 2Y

Substituting the value of C, we get:

22 = 2Y

Solving for Y, we find:

Y = 11

Now that we have the values of C and Y, we can find the total number of seashells collected by all three individuals:

Total = C + J + Y
= 22 + 27 + 11
= 60

To divide the total number of seashells equally among the three individuals, we can divide by 3:

Seashells per person = Total ÷ 3
= 60 ÷ 3
= 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of carrots Mason consumes on weekdays. Since there are 5 weekdays, and he eats 4 carrots each day, the total number of carrots on weekdays is:

5 days * 4 carrots/day = 20 carrots

Next, we calculate the total number of carrots Mason consumes on the weekend. There are 2 weekend days, and he eats 5 carrots each day, resulting in:

2 days * 5 carrots/day = 10 carrots

Now, we add the total number of carrots consumed on weekdays and the weekend to find the overall weekly consumption:

20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week."
"To calculate the total time of the cassette, we can use the concept of percentages and basic arithmetic operations.

Given that the second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes, we can calculate the length of the second song as follows:

Let's denote the length of the first song as x. Since the second song is 60% longer, its length can be expressed as x + 0.6x = 1.6x.

We know the length of the first song is 5 minutes, so we can set up the equation:
x = 5

Now, we can find the length of the second song:
1.6x = 1.6 * 5 = 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette:
Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
Total time = 5 + 8 = 13 minutes

Therefore, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To calculate the total profit, we must first determine the total cost and the total selling price of the mobile devices.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is the sum of these two amounts: $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost: $240 - $120 = $120.

Therefore, the total profit is $120."
"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we can analyze the given information step by step.

We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel. This implies that Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet. Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, we can calculate the length of the cane by dividing Carl's height by 2. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of additional bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

Total energy demand = 2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we can find the excess production by subtracting the total demand from the current production:

Excess production = 4200 - 460 = 3740 bottles

However, this represents the excess production, not the additional production needed. To find the additional production required, we subtract the excess production from the current production:

Additional production needed = 4200 - 3740 = 460 bottles

Therefore, Hortex needs to produce 460 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final answer is 460."
"To calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to consider the intersection of the two events: wearing a bow and wearing purple.

Let's break it down:

Number of babies wearing purple = 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue = 1/4 * 8 = 2
Number of babies wearing bows = 1/3 * (number of purple wearers) + (number of blue wearers)
= 1/3 * 6 + 2
= 2 + 2
= 4

Now, we can find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple using the formula for conditional probability:

P(Purple | Bow) = P(Purple ∩ Bow) / P(Bow)
= (number of purple bow wearers) / (number of bow wearers)
= 6 / 4
= 3/2
= 1.5

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
= 1.5 * 100
= 150%

However, since the probability cannot exceed 100%, we need to reconsider our calculation. The correct approach is to find the number of purple bow wearers and divide it by the total number of babies wearing bows.

Number of purple bow wearers = 1/3 * 6 = 2
P(Purple | Bow) = 2 / 4
= 1/2
= 0.5
= 50%

The correct answer is 50%."
"To determine the number of reports received on Wednesday, we can utilize the principle of subtraction. By subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received in the first two days and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, we can isolate the number of reports received on Wednesday.

Let's denote the number of reports received on Wednesday as W. We know that the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday is 1907, the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday is 2136, and the total number of reports received last week is 5168.

We can set up the following equation:

W + 1907 + 2136 = 5168

Combine like terms:

W + 4043 = 5168

Subtract 4043 from both sides:

W = 5168 - 4043

W = 1125

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To determine the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to calculate the amount earned from each sale and add them together.

Abraham initially sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. This can be represented as:

80 / 2 = 40 square meters sold for $50

He then sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. To find the amount of land sold, we can calculate:

80 / 4 = 20 square meters sold for $30

Now, let's calculate the amount of land remaining:

80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters

Abraham sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. To find the total amount earned from this sale, we can multiply the remaining land by the price per square meter:

20 * 3 = $60

Now, let's add the amounts earned from each sale:

$50 + $30 + $60 = $140

The final answer is: $140"
"To solve this problem, we can represent Haley's age as 'H' and Geb's age as 'G'. We are given that Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, so we can write the equation:

G = (1/2)H - 10

We are also given that Haley is 26 years old, so we can substitute H = 26 into the equation:

G = (1/2)(26) - 10
G = 13 - 10
G = 3

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we need to establish the daily face mask usage. Given that Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, we can calculate the daily usage as follows:

Daily face mask usage = Number of face mask changes per day * Number of times Tyrion goes out per day
Daily face mask usage = 2 * 3
Daily face mask usage = 6

Now, to find the total number of face masks used every 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:

Total face masks used every 2 days = Daily face mask usage * 2
Total face masks used every 2 days = 6 * 2
Total face masks used every 2 days = 12

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we must first calculate the total number of eggs found by each individual.

Lamar finds 5 eggs, Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, which is 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, we add up the total number of eggs found:
5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we convert 3 dozen to a numerical value: 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
36 (total hidden) - 27 (total found) = 9 eggs

The final answer is 9."
"To calculate John's weekly earnings, we need to first determine the total number of apartments he collects garbage from. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have a combined total of 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. 

The last complex is 60% larger than the other two combined, which means it has 1.6 times the number of apartments as the other two combined. 

So, the last complex has 1.6 * 400 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since he collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year.

Let's break it down step by step:

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * 17150 - 200 = 17100 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in the first 8 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 = 52500

In the 10th year, the tree produces 1000 fruits. So, the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years is:
52500 + 1000 = 52700

The final answer is: $\boxed{52700}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money Jack has now, we can use the concept of fractions. Since Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, we can calculate this amount as follows:

1/5 × $100 = $20

Now, we add this amount to the $100 Jack already had:

$100 + $20 = $120

Therefore, Jack now has a total of $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the lengths of the three ropes. Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We are given that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can express this relationship as an equation:

B = Y - 7

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, which can be represented as:

R = 4B

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:

Y + B + R = 37

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y into the third equation, we get:

Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:

6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:

6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:

Y = 12

Now that we have found the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:

B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:

R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's denote the amount of money Ronnie was given as 'x'. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, we can express the amount of money Rissa was given as 3x.

We know that after giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means she gave 1/5 of her money to her sister. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x - (1/5) * 3x = (4/5) * 3x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x - (3/5)x = (12/5)x

Combine like terms:

(18/5)x - (3/5)x = (12/5)x

This simplifies to:

(15/5)x = (12/5)x

Now, we can solve for x:

15x = 12x

Subtract 12x from both sides:

3x = 0

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 0

Since x represents the amount of money Ronnie was given, we can conclude that Ronnie was given $0.

The final answer is $0."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as 'x'. Since there are equal amounts of these three colors, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 3x.

We know that half the mural is yellow, and the total amount of paint used is 12 pints. Since the amount of yellow paint is half of the total, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

Now, we can set up the equation: 3x + 6 = 12.

To solve for x, we can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 12 - 6, which simplifies to 3x = 6.

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate x: x = 6 / 3, which simplifies to x = 2.

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total area of Tom's house, we must first calculate the area of each room and then sum them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 feet x 12 feet = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 x 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 + 1200 + 1000 = 2440 square feet.

Therefore, the total area of the house is 2440 square feet."
"The problem at hand involves a simple yet intriguing sequence of cloud counts. We're dealing with a geometric progression where each term is twice the previous one, starting from 3. This is a classic example of a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2.

To find the sum of the first five terms, we can utilize the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:

S_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S_n is the sum of the first n terms, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 3, r = 2, and n = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S_5 = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S_5 = 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1)
S_5 = 3 * (-31) / (-1)
S_5 = 3 * 31
S_5 = 93

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice counted across all five days is 93.

The final answer is: $\boxed{93}$"
"To determine the number of cycles that can be run with the new box, we first need to calculate the cost per pod. Given that the new box contains 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate the cost per pod as follows:

Cost per pod = Total cost of the new box / Number of pods in the new box
= $12 / (100 + 20% of 100)
= $12 / (100 + 0.20 * 100)
= $12 / (100 + 20)
= $12 / 120
= $0.10 per pod

Now, we can calculate the number of cycles that can be run with $1 by dividing the available amount by the cost per pod:

Number of cycles = Available amount / Cost per pod
= $1 / $0.10
= 10 cycles

The correct answer is: A"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a series of steps:

1. Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, resulting in 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money, resulting in 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills, which gives us 60 / 5 = 12.

Therefore, Thomas now has 12 five-dollar bills.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of goals scored in the match, we can break down the information into two parts: the first half and the second half.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals, and team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, which can be expressed as 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.5}$"
"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he needs to recycle the chalk, we can set up an equation based on the rate of chalk usage.

Let's denote the total length of the chalk as 5 inches. The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, and he recycled the chalk when it reached 2 inches. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, which is equivalent to 2.25 inches.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we can express the remaining chalk as a function of the number of days (x):

Remaining chalk = 5 - 0.20x

We know that the teacher recycled the chalk when it reached 2 inches, so we can set up the equation:

5 - 0.20x = 2

Solving for x, we get:

0.20x = 3
x = 15

However, this represents the number of days it would take to use up the entire chalk at the original rate. Since the teacher recycled the chalk after using 2.25 inches, we need to find the number of days it takes to use up the remaining 2.25 inches at the reduced rate.

Let's denote the number of days it takes to use up the remaining 2.25 inches as 'y'. We can set up the equation:

0.20y = 2.25

Solving for y, we get:

y = 11.25

Since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to find the number of days it takes to use up the remaining 2.25 inches at the reduced rate, which is 11.25 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11.25}$"
"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we must first calculate the number of students on varsity. 

The number of girls on varsity is one-third of 12, which can be calculated as 12 * (1/3) = 4. Similarly, the number of boys on varsity is one-fourth of 12, which can be calculated as 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is the sum of the number of girls and boys on varsity, which is 4 + 3 = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 + 12 = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is the difference between the total number of students and the total number of students on varsity, which is 24 - 7 = 17.

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is 17."
"To determine the number of face masks Johnny bought, we can apply a straightforward arithmetic operation. 

First, we need to calculate thrice the number of face masks Mike bought. Since Mike purchased 5 face masks, we multiply 5 by 3 to get 15. 

Next, we add 2 to this result to find the total number of face masks Johnny bought. Therefore, 15 + 2 = 17.

The final answer is 17."
"To determine the percentage of teeth fixed, we need to calculate the ratio of fixed teeth to the total number of teeth and then convert it to a percentage.

Number of teeth drilled = 4
Number of teeth capped = 7 + 4 = 11

Total number of teeth fixed = 4 + 11 = 15

Total number of teeth James has = 30

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15/30) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth."
"To calculate the refund, we need to find 2/5 of 4000 gallons. 

We can simplify the fraction 2/5 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. 

2/5 = 1/2.5

Now, we can multiply 1/2.5 by 4000:

(1/2.5) * 4000 = (1/5) * 1600

Since 1/5 of 1600 is 320, the total refund will be:

320

The final answer is: $320"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let W represent Wendy's current age and C represent Colin's current age. From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 3:

3C + 75 = W

Now we have two equations and two variables:

W = 5C + 35
3C + 75 = W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

Therefore, Colin's current age is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of books Bob can buy per school, we need to divide the total amount he has ($27,000) by the cost of 100 books ($500) and then divide the result by 3.

First, let's calculate the total number of sets of 100 books Bob can buy:

$27,000 ÷ $500 = 54 sets

Now, we'll divide the total number of sets by 3 schools:

54 sets ÷ 3 schools = 18 sets per school

Since each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find the total number of books per school:

18 sets per school × 100 books per set = 1800 books per school

Therefore, Bob can buy 1800 books per school."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a series of steps:

Let's denote the initial number of apples as A. 

1. Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. This results in a total of A + 5 apples.
2. He then put all but 1 apple in his pocket, so he put 6 apples in his pocket and threw 1 apple back into the tree. This caused another 6 apples to fall out. Now, he has A + 5 + 6 = A + 11 apples.

Since Newton picked up all the remaining apples and went home, the total number of apples he brought home is A + 11.

However, we don't know the initial number of apples (A). To provide a numerical answer, we need more information. Unfortunately, the problem doesn't provide enough information to determine the exact number of apples Newton brought home.

However, if we assume the problem intends to ask for the total number of apples after the last step, we can provide the answer as:

A + 11"
"To calculate the total cost of Ali's coal order, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = (Total Weight of Coal / Weight per Bag) * Cost per Bag

Given:
Total Weight of Coal = 850 kg
Weight per Bag = 50 kg
Cost per Bag = $18

Total Cost = (850 kg / 50 kg) * $18
= 17 * $18
= $306

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we can analyze the situation using the concept of total slices required and the number of slices per pizza.

Let's denote the number of cheese pizzas as C and the number of pepperoni pizzas as P. We know that each pizza has 12 slices for cheese and 8 slices for pepperoni. Since Kate's 6 friends each eat 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, the total number of slices required can be expressed as:

Total slices = (6 friends * 6 cheese slices per friend) + (6 friends * 4 pepperoni slices per friend)
Total slices = 36 + 24
Total slices = 60

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of slices:

12C + 8P = 60

Since we want to find the minimum number of pizzas, we can try to find the smallest whole number values of C and P that satisfy the equation. We can start by trying different values of C and solving for P.

Let's try C = 5:

"To determine the total miles Sam ran this week, we can utilize the principle of additive combinatorics. This principle allows us to calculate the total by summing the individual distances covered on each day.

Let's break down the information provided:

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. This can be expressed as 3 miles * 3 days = 9 miles.
- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. This can be expressed as 5 miles * 2 days = 10 miles.

Now, we can apply the principle of additive combinatorics to find the total miles:

Total miles = (3 miles * 3 days) + (5 miles * 2 days)
Total miles = 9 miles + 10 miles
Total miles = 19 miles

Therefore, Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week."
"To solve this problem, we can model the situation using a linear differential equation. Let's denote the number of snowballs Jay builds at time t (in hours) as y(t). We know that Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour, so the rate of change of y with respect to time is 20. However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which is equivalent to 1/4 of an hour. Therefore, the rate of change of y with respect to time is -1/4.

The differential equation representing this situation is:

dy/dt = 20 - (1/4)y

To solve this differential equation, we can use an integrating factor. The integrating factor is e^(∫(-1/4)dt) = e^(-t/4).

Multiplying both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor, we get:

e^(-t/4)dy/dt + (1/4)e^(-t/4)y = 20e^(-t/4)

The left-hand side of the equation is the derivative of e^(-t/4)y. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:

d(e^(-t/4)y)/dt = 20e^(-t/4)

Integrating both sides with respect to t, we get:

∫d(e^(-t/4)y) = ∫20e^(-t/4)dt

Evaluating the integrals, we get:

e^(-t/4)y = -80e^(-t/4) + C

where C is the constant of integration.

To find the value of C, we can use the initial condition that y(0) = 0 (since Jay starts with no snowballs). Substituting t = 0 into the equation, we get:

e^(0/4)y(0) = -80e^(0/4) + C
0 = -80 + C
C = 80

Now that we have the value of C, we can rewrite the equation as:

e^(-t/4)y = -80e^(-t/4) + 80

To find the time it takes for Jay to build 60 snowballs, we can set y = 60 and solve for t:

60 = -80e^(-t/4) + 80
-20 = -80e^(-t/4)
1/4 = e^(-t/4)
ln(1/4) = -t/4
-t/4 = ln(1/4)
t = -4ln(1/4)

Using a calculator to evaluate the natural logarithm, we get:

t ≈ 5.21

Therefore, it will take approximately 5.21 hours for Jay to build 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5.21}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's represent John's age as J and Jim's age as j. We are given that John is twice as old as Jim, so we can write the equation:

J = 2j

We are also given that John's current age is 28, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

28 = 2j

To solve for j, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

j = 28 / 2
j = 14

Therefore, Jim's age is 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the total number of slices eaten, we can apply basic arithmetic principles. 

Let's denote the number of slices Doxa ate as D, the number her sister ate as S, and the number her brother ate as B. We are given the following information:

D = 1
S = D + 1
B = S + 1

We can substitute the expressions for S and B into the equation for the total number of slices eaten:

Total slices eaten = D + S + B
= D + (D + 1) + ((D + 1) + 1)
= D + D + 1 + D + 1 + 1
= 3D + 3

Now, we can substitute the value of D into the equation:

Total slices eaten = 3(1) + 3
= 3 + 3
= 6

Therefore, the total number of slices eaten is 6."
"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages, so they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had x + 12 bandages from the first day, so they had x + 12 + 28 = x + 40 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is a total of 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had x + 40 - 25 = x + 15 bandages left.

Since they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, we can set up the equation x + 15 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 78 - 15 = 63.

Therefore, the nurses started with 63 bandages on the first day.

Final answer: 63"
"To calculate the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to consider the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut separately. The cost of the color is a fixed amount of $40. 

The cost of the haircut, however, is calculated based on the difference in length of her hair. Her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, resulting in a reduction of 2 inches. Given that the cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, the total cost of the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut: $40 + $60 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we can break down the problem into two components: her hourly earnings and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her total hours worked in April. Since there are 4 weeks in April and she works 7.5 hours a day, we can multiply the number of hours worked per day by the number of days worked per week and then by the number of weeks:

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks
= 7.5 * 6 * 4
= 180 hours

Next, we can calculate her total earnings from her hourly rate by multiplying the total hours worked by her hourly rate:

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour
= $270

Since Jen has complete attendance, she receives an additional $10. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:

Total earnings = $270 + $10
= $280

The final answer is: $280"
"To calculate Jason's total earnings, we can break down the tasks and their respective earnings:

- Dishwasher: 6 instances × $0.50 per instance = $3.00
- Laundry: 1 instance × $3.00 per instance = $3.00
- Trash: 2 instances × $0.75 per instance = $1.50
- Room cleaning: 1 instance × $1.50 per instance = $1.50

Now, let's add the amounts together: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00

Therefore, Jason's total earnings for the two-week period are $8.00."
"To calculate the total amount of blood that ten sharks have, we can utilize the concept of scalar multiplication. Given that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we can express this relationship as a ratio: 3:1 (shark:whale). 

We can then multiply the amount of blood a whale has by the ratio to find the amount of blood a shark has: 40 * 3 = 120 gallons. 

Now, we can multiply the amount of blood a single shark has by 10 to find the total amount of blood that ten sharks have: 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1200}$"
"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we can break down the problem into three distinct periods: morning, 10:00, and evening.

Let's denote the number of people who entered in the morning as M, the number of people who entered at 10:00 as T, and the number of people who entered by evening as E.

We are given the following information:

M = 50 (number of people who entered in the morning)
T = 40 (number of people who entered at 10:00)
E = 3T (number of people who entered by evening, which is three times the number of people who entered at 10:00)

We can calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant by adding the number of people who entered in each period:

Total = M + T + E
= 50 + 40 + 3(40)
= 50 + 40 + 120
= 210

Therefore, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 210."
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the number of red pens: 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 pens.

Next, we calculate the number of black pens, which is twice the amount of red pens: 2 * 25 pens = 50 pens.

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens to find the total: 25 pens + 50 pens = 75 pens.

Therefore, Alain has a total of 75 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first determine the cost of the scotch and cognac.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:
$600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle

The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. To find the cost of the cognac per bottle, we multiply the cost of the scotch by 1.5 (100% + 50%):
$60 × 1.5 = $90 per bottle

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 × $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac:
$600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the number of White Oak trees and the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on each day.

Let's start with the White Oak trees. On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 trees. On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making the total 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.

Now, let's move on to the Lodgepole Pine trees. On the first day, he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 trees. On the second day, he planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50 trees.

To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days, we add the total number of White Oak trees and Lodgepole Pine trees: 30 + 50 = 80.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the amount of root beer available for the party, we must consider the sequence of events that affected the quantity.

Initially, Fred had 24 gallons of root beer. On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons. Then, on the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, resulting in 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remaining. On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons. Finally, on the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, leaving 8 - 3 = 5 gallons.

To find the amount each person received, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people: 5 ÷ 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.67}$"
"To solve the equation 4x + 8 = 40, we can employ the fundamental principles of linear algebra. By subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation, we obtain:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can utilize the property of equality to isolate the variable x by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

We can express this as a fraction: 66 ÷ 3 = 22.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining fish. 
66 - 22 = 44.

Next, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish. 
We can calculate this as (5/11) × 44 = 20.

To find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 
22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is 42."
"To determine the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we must consider the colors from both the palettes and the makeup sets.

Initially, Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, resulting in a total of 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes. Additionally, she had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, contributing a total of 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets. Therefore, the total number of colors Amy had initially is 8 + 18 = 26.

However, her sister stole one palette, which contained 4 colors. This reduces the total number of colors by 4, resulting in 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 colors. This leaves her with 22 - 3 = 19 colors.

The final answer is 19."
"To determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we must first establish the height of the first floor and the second floor.

The height of the first floor is 7 times the height of Mattison, who is 60 inches tall. Therefore, the height of the first floor is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The height of the second floor is three times the height of Mattison, so it is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor can be found by subtracting the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To find the number of shells team Alphas found, we can calculate 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280

"To calculate the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find 40% of the house's value, which is $250,000. This can be calculated as 0.4 x $250,000 = $100,000.

Next, we need to find 60% of this amount, which is used to pay off debts. This can be calculated as 0.6 x $100,000 = $60,000.

To find the amount leftover, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the total loan amount: $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.

Therefore, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts."
"To calculate the total earnings from selling the tunas, we need to multiply the total weight of the tunas by the cost per kilogram. 

The total weight of the tunas is 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms. 

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram: 128 * 0.50 = $64.

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To calculate Trinity's profit, we can use the formula:

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price

Given that the selling price is 11/8 of the cost price, we can express this as:

Selling Price = (11/8) * Cost Price

We are given that the cost price is $72. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

Selling Price = (11/8) * 72
Selling Price = (11 * 9)
Selling Price = 99

Now, we can calculate the profit:

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To determine the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day, and Brian ran it for 3 days, resulting in a total of 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the number of balloons thrown, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach.

"To determine the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we must first calculate the amount of each medicine in one dose. 

The first medicine requires 14 mL per dose. The second medicine requires 3 times that amount, which is 3 x 14 = 42 mL. 

The total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of these two: 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8: 56 mL x 8 = 448 mL.

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL."
"To determine the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the capacity of John's school first. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can find the capacity of one class by multiplying Ali's class capacity by 1/8.

Capacity of one class = (1/8) * 120
= 120/8
= 15

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school.

Capacity of John's school = 2 * 15
= 30

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (120) to the capacity of John's school (30) to find the combined capacity of both schools.

Combined capacity = 120 + 30
= 150

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To calculate the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to determine the interest accrued over the initial 11 months. 

The interest rate is 2% of the initial amount borrowed, which is $300. 

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

The monthly payment for 11 months is $25. 

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Now, we add the interest to the total amount paid in 11 months to find the amount to be paid in the twelfth month.

Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = Total amount paid in 11 months + Interest
= $275 + $6
= $281

The final answer is: $281"
"To determine the number of diapers Jordan changes per day, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of diaper changes required for both children, which is 2 children * 5 diaper changes per child = 10 diaper changes. 

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, we can express this as a fraction: 10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes.

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To determine the number of red jelly beans in the jar, we must first calculate the volume of the jar. Given its square base and height, the volume can be calculated as:

V = l * w * h = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches

However, we must account for the packing efficiency, which is approximately 80%. To do this, we divide the volume by the efficiency:

V_total = V / 0.8 = 540 / 0.8 = 675 jelly beans

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans as:

R = 0.3 * V_total = 0.3 * 675 = 202.5

Given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900, we can calculate the difference:

Difference = 900 - 202.5 = 697.5

The final answer is: $\boxed{698}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the total number of people on the bus after each stop.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, making the total number of people 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second station, making the total number of people 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. This means the number of people on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the remaining spaces on the bus are 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Pauline's museum visits, we need to consider the initial cost and the subsequent increase in cost.

The initial cost of one visit was $2, and it increased by 150% after 5 years. This means the new cost is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $6.

For the first 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $2 = $10.

For the next 3 years, the cost is 3 * $6 = $18.

The total cost for all 8 years is $10 + $18 = $28.

The final answer is: $28"
"To determine the total time required for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups and the time required for each group.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students/grade * 3 grades = 30 students
30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students. To find the total number of students in the partial group, we multiply the number of students per group by the number of partial group students:

2 students * 8 students per group = 16 students

Now, we can calculate the total number of students:

3 full groups * 8 students per group = 24 students
24 students + 16 students = 40 students

The time required for each group is 45 minutes. So, the total time required for 3 full groups is:

3 groups * 45 minutes/group = 135 minutes

For the 1 group with 2 students, the time required is 45 minutes.

Total time required = 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Therefore, the total time required for everyone to try the escape room is 180 minutes."
"To calculate the total amount Ali has to pay John, we can break down the costs into two components: the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames.

The cost of 4 tables at $20 each can be calculated using the formula: 4 x $20 = $80.

Similarly, the cost of 2 roof frames at $10 each can be calculated using the formula: 2 x $10 = $20.

To find the total amount Ali has to pay John, we add the costs of the tables and the roof frames: $80 + $20 = $100.

Therefore, the total amount Ali has to pay John is $100."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We can set up the equation based on the total length of the board:

x + 4x = 40

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 40

Dividing both sides by 5, we find:

x = 8

Now that we have the value of x, we can determine the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x
= 4(8)
= 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine the amount of steakhouse seasoning Aiden needs, we must first establish the ratio of seasoning to pounds of meat. Given that he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of ground beef, we can express this as a ratio:

2 tablespoons seasoning / 1 pound meat

Since Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs, and he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can calculate the total pounds of meat required:

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Now, we can multiply the number of pounds by the seasoning ratio to find the total amount of seasoning needed:

5 pounds * (2 tablespoons seasoning / 1 pound) = 10 tablespoons

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total amount of fabric Luke needs to buy, we must calculate the total width of the windows and then multiply it by 2.

The total width of the windows can be found by multiplying the number of windows (5) by the width of each window (35 inches).

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we can break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is:
16 × $0.25 = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, so the total cost is:
20 × $0.20 = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

Therefore, the total cost of the 36-minute call is $8.00."
"To determine the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we must first calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. 

Then, we add 1 more inch to this amount, so the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

Therefore, the total inches of rain on Tuesday is 5 inches."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'x'. Since Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies can be represented as 3x - 2.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, which is given as 10. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

Combining like terms, we get:

4x - 2 = 10

Adding 2 to both sides:

4x = 12

Dividing both sides by 4:

x = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the manicure and pedicure with nail art, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure. The original price of the manicure is $35, and the original price of the pedicure is $40. The total original price is $35 + $40 = $75. The discount for getting both services is 20% of $75, which can be calculated as 0.20 * $75 = $15. Therefore, the discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the nail art. Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art services (5 for her fingers and 5 for her toes). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure and the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we can break down the problem into its constituent parts.

First, we have three magazines that send 12 issues each, resulting in a total of 3 x 12 = 36 issues per year.

Next, we have one magazine that sends 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 x 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, we can add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives a total of 66 magazines per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{66}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as x.

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can express Shelley's paintings as x + 8.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so we can represent Samantha's paintings as (x + 8) - 12.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, which allows us to set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides yields:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To calculate the price of the toy after the discounts, we can break it down into two steps.

First, we calculate the price increase in December. The initial price is $40, and it increases by 80%. This can be represented as:

$40 + (80% of $40) = $40 + (0.8 * $40) = $40 + $32 = $72

Next, we calculate the price decrease in January. The price in December is $72, and it decreases by 50%. This can be represented as:

$72 - (50% of $72) = $72 - (0.5 * $72) = $72 - $36 = $36

Therefore, the price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we can break down the problem into two parts: the standard lessons and the lessons with veterans.

First, let's calculate the total amount earned from the standard lessons. Charlie charges $80 per hour and has 4 lessons, so the total amount earned from the standard lessons is:

4 * $80 = $320

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the lessons with veterans. Charlie reduces his rate by 25%, which is equivalent to subtracting 25% of $80 from the original rate. To calculate 25% of $80, we multiply $80 by 0.25:

$80 * 0.25 = $20

Now, we subtract $20 from the original rate to get the reduced rate:

$80 - $20 = $60

Charlie has 2 lessons with veterans, so the total amount earned from these lessons is:

2 * $60 = $120

Finally, we add the amount earned from the standard lessons and the amount earned from the lessons with veterans to get the total amount Charlie will make for the day:

$320 + $120 = $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To calculate the mean score, we need to find the arithmetic mean of the given dataset. The arithmetic mean is calculated by summing up all the scores and dividing by the total number of scores.

Let's denote the scores as x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, and x9. The sum of these scores is:

x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 + x7 + x8 + x9 = 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

There are 9 scores in total. To find the mean, we divide the sum by 9:

Mean = (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 + x7 + x8 + x9) / 9
Mean = 630 / 9
Mean = 70

Therefore, the mean score is 70."
"To determine the number of pomelos Eve gave away, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of pomelos Eve gave away as x. Since she had 1/4 of the original amount left, we can express this as:

20 - x = (1/4) * 20

To solve for x, we can first simplify the right-hand side of the equation:

20 - x = 5

Next, we can isolate x by subtracting 20 from both sides:

-x = -15

Multiplying both sides by -1 to solve for x:

x = 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

Final answer: 15"
"To determine the amount of money Walter received from selling the remaining apples, we must first calculate the number of apples remaining after he ate 2/5 of the initial 60 apples.

First, we calculate 2/5 of 60:
(2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples

The remaining number of apples is:
60 - 24 = 36 apples

Next, we calculate 25% of the remaining apples:
(25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9 apples

The number of apples remaining after giving 25% to his sister is:
36 - 9 = 27 apples

Since Walter sold the remaining apples at $3 each, we multiply the number of apples by the selling price:
27 * 3 = $81

The final answer is: $81"
"To determine the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Since 3 quarters of the novels she wrote this year equals the number of novels she wrote last year, we can set up a proportion to solve for the total number of novels written this year.

Let x represent the total number of novels written this year. The proportion can be written as:

3/4 = 9/x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3x = 9 * 4
3x = 36

Now, divide both sides by 3:

x = 36/3
x = 12

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

Final answer: 12"
"To calculate the distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. 

First, we need to convert the days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is equal to 3 x 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered by Michael:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 50 km/hr x 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we need to divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) x 100
Percentage = (3600 / 6000) x 100
Percentage = 0.6 x 100
Percentage = 60%

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. 

First, we need to find the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother. Since Madeline ate 6 grapes and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, we can express this as an equation: 

Let x be the number of grapes Madeline's brother used. Then, we have:
x = 5 * 6
x = 30

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 (by Madeline) + 30 (by her brother) = 36 grapes.

Next, we know that their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. Let's denote the total number of grapes at the beginning as y. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

y - 36 = 4 * 12

Simplifying the equation, we get:
y - 36 = 48

Adding 36 to both sides, we get:
y = 84

Therefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School, we can utilize the principle of addition. 

The number of teachers who were sick is 13, and the number of substitute teachers is 9. By combining these two quantities, we can calculate the total number of teachers present.

Total number of teachers = Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers
Total number of teachers = 13 + 9
Total number of teachers = 22

Therefore, the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School that day was 22."
"To calculate the total yearly cost of making macaroni and cheese, we can break down the costs as follows:

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost of pasta in a year is:

$1.00 * 52 = $52.00

The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00, and the cost of gruyere cheese per week is $6.00 (twice the cost of cheddar cheese). Therefore, the total cost of cheese per week is:

$3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00

The total weekly cost of making macaroni and cheese is the sum of the cost of pasta and cheese:

$52.00 + $9.00 = $61.00

To find the total yearly cost, we multiply the weekly cost by 52:

$61.00 * 52 = $3,132.00

The final answer is: $3,132."
"To calculate the percentage of the custodian's day spent cleaning, we must first determine the total hours spent cleaning. 

The custodian cleans 80 classrooms, with each classroom taking 15 minutes to clean. Converting the time to hours, we have:
80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes
1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

Now, we divide the total hours spent cleaning by the total hours worked in a day (8 hours) and multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage:
(20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 25%

Therefore, the custodian spends 25% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we must first establish the capacity of each shelf. We know that the middle two shelves can hold 10 books each, and the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. Therefore, the bottom shelf can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the shelves:
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books
Total capacity: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, we can divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves:
110 ÷ 45 = 2.44

To accommodate all the books, we must round up to the nearest whole number, as we cannot have a fraction of a bookcase. Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

Final answer: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate Rose's profit, we must first determine the total cost and the total selling price.

The total cost can be found by multiplying the number of dozens by the cost per dozen: 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of eggs, which is 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Now, we can calculate the total selling price by multiplying the number of eggs by the selling price per egg: 60 * $1 = $60.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price: $60 - $12 = $48.

Therefore, Rose's profit is $48."
"To determine the number of white hats, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we find the number of red hats: 1/2 of 100 hats is 50 red hats. 

Next, we subtract the number of red hats from the total: 100 - 50 = 50 hats remaining.

Then, we find the number of blue hats: 3/5 of the remaining 50 hats is (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.

Finally, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the cost of each stick of jerky, we must first calculate the discounted price of the bag. The original price is $18.00, and the discount is $3.00. The discounted price can be found by subtracting the discount from the original price:

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Next, we divide the discounted price by the number of sticks in the bag, which is 30, to find the cost per stick:

$\frac{\$15.00}{30} = \$0.50$

To express this in cents, we multiply by 100:

$\$0.50 \times 100 = 50$ cents

Therefore, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test as 'x'. 

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct to pass, we can set up the following equation:

(0.7)(70) + x = 77

This equation represents the total number of questions she needs to get correct, which is 70% of the first test (0.7)(70) plus the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test (x).

Now, let's solve for x:

(0.7)(70) = 49
49 + x = 77
x = 77 - 49
x = 28

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 28 questions correct on the second test to pass.

The final answer is 28."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as x. The number of blueberry cubes is given as 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be expressed as 5x - 4.

We are told that the total number of ice cubes is 116. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combining like terms, we get:

6x - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation yields:

6x = 120

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

x = 20

Now that we have determined the value of x, we can calculate the number of blueberry cubes by substituting x into the expression 5x - 4:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

The final answer is: $\boxed{96}$"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored, we can utilize the fundamental principles of arithmetic. Specifically, we will employ the multiplication of consecutive integers, where the number of games played per year (40) is multiplied by the number of years (4) and then by the points scored per game (21).

The calculation can be represented as:

Total points scored = 40 * 4 * 21

Using the associative property of multiplication, we can rearrange the expression to facilitate the calculation:

Total points scored = (40 * 21) * 4

First, we multiply 40 by 21:

40 * 21 = 840

Then, we multiply the result by 4:

840 * 4 = 3360

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To determine the number of marbles Brendan ended up with, we can break down the events:

Brendan initially had 10 marbles. He lost half of them, which is 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. This leaves him with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles. Then, he found 3 more marbles, bringing the total to 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. Finally, he discarded a non-marble, which doesn't change the count.

Therefore, Brendan ended up with 8 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 potential customer. This means the ratio of telephone calls to potential customers is 25:1.

We also know that for every 2 potential customers, 1 car is sold. This means the ratio of potential customers to cars sold is 2:1.

To find the ratio of telephone calls to cars sold, we can multiply the two ratios:

(25:1) × (2:1) = 50:1

This means that for every 50 telephone calls, Jason sells 1 car.

Since Jason needs to sell 15 cars, we can set up a proportion to find the number of telephone calls needed:

50:1 = x:15

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

50 × 15 = 1 × x
750 = x

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: 750"
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights, we can break down the problem into two parts: flashlights and candles.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. Since there are 4 people and 2 flashlights per person, we can multiply the number of people by 2 to find the total number of flashlights: 4 * 2 = 8.

Next, let's calculate the total number of candles. We have two types of candles: small and medium. Half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Since half of 8 is 4, we can calculate the total number of small candles as 4 * 4 = 16 and the total number of medium candles as 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, let's add the total number of flashlights and candles: 8 flashlights + 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 44.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44}$"
"To determine the number of chips each person receives, we must first calculate the total number of chips. Since Mitchell purchases two bags of chips, each containing 55 chips, the total number of chips can be found by multiplying the number of bags by the number of chips per bag: 2 * 55 = 110.

Next, we divide the total number of chips (110) by the number of family members (5) to find the number of chips each person receives. This can be expressed as:

110 ÷ 5 = 22

Therefore, each person receives 22 chips.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To calculate the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we can break down the process into individual segments and apply the given time allocations.

The first side takes 5 minutes. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, resulting in 10 minutes for each. The last two sides, the fourth and fifth, each take half as long as the first side, resulting in 2.5 minutes for each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:

Time = 5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side)
Time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5
Time = 30 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a straightforward approach by applying the given relationships between the number of robots, helmets, and footballs.

Let's denote the number of robots as R, the number of helmets as H, and the number of footballs as F. We are given that H = 20 and H = R/2. We can use the first equation to express R in terms of H:

R = 2H
R = 2(20)
R = 40

Now, we are also given that H = F/2. We can use this equation to express F in terms of H:

F = 2H
F = 2(20)
F = 40

Now that we have the values for R and F, we can find the total number of items by adding them together:

Total number of items = R + H + F
Total number of items = 40 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we can utilize the concept of unit conversion and multiplication.

First, we need to convert the time spent per day from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can multiply the number of hours by 60.

6 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day

Next, we can divide the total minutes per day by the time spent per call to find the number of calls dealt with per day.

360 minutes/day ÷ 15 minutes/call = 24 calls/day

Finally, we can multiply the number of calls dealt with per day by the number of days worked per week to find the total number of calls dealt with in a week.

24 calls/day * 5 days/week = 120 calls/week

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To calculate the time difference, we can use the formula: 

Time difference = (Time for new varnish * Number of paintings) - (Time for old varnish * Number of paintings)

Given:
Time for old varnish = 7 minutes
Time for new varnish = 12 minutes
Number of paintings = 6

Time difference = (12 * 6) - (7 * 6)
Time difference = 72 - 42
Time difference = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we can break down the problem into three distinct groups based on the water requirements of each group of plants.

First, we'll calculate the total water needed for the 4 plants that require half a cup of water. This can be expressed as 4 × 0.5 cups.

Next, we'll calculate the total water needed for the 8 plants that require 1 cup of water. This can be expressed as 8 × 1 cup.

Lastly, we'll calculate the total water needed for the remaining 8 plants that require a quarter of a cup of water. This can be expressed as 8 × 0.25 cups.

Now, we'll add the water needed for each group together: (4 × 0.5) + (8 × 1) + (8 × 0.25).

Let's calculate the total: (4 × 0.5) = 2 cups, (8 × 1) = 8 cups, and (8 × 0.25) = 2 cups. Adding these amounts together, we get 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we must consider the combined rates of his hopping and swimming. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the total time by adding the time taken to cover the land distance and the time taken to cover the water distance.

The land distance is 100 yards, and Phineas hops at a rate of 20 yards per minute. To find the time taken to cover the land distance, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

Time (land) = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes

The water distance is also 100 yards, and Phineas swims at a rate of 10 yards per minute. Using the same formula:

Time (water) = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes

To find the total time, we add the time taken to cover the land distance and the time taken to cover the water distance:

Total Time = Time (land) + Time (water)
= 5 minutes + 10 minutes
= 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of the popsicle sticks needed for Bob's project, we can employ a straightforward division operation to calculate the number of boxes required.

Let's perform the calculation: 56 ÷ 8 = 7

Since each box costs $2.00, we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box to obtain the total cost:

7 × $2.00 = $14.00

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we can break down the costs as follows:

Let's denote the cost of the main phone as M and the cost of each additional phone as A. We are given that M = 2A and M = $20. 

We can solve for A by dividing both sides of the equation M = 2A by 2, which gives us A = M/2 = $20/2 = $10.

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone, we can find the total cost of the four additional phones by multiplying A by 4: 4A = 4($10) = $40.

Finally, we add the cost of the main phone to the cost of the four additional phones to find the total cost of the phone plan: M + 4A = $20 + $40 = $60.

Therefore, the total cost of the phone plan is $60."
"To calculate Derrick's total earnings in June, we must first determine the daily and monthly production of doughnuts. Derrick produces 10 dozen doughnuts per day, which is equivalent to 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

Since June has 30 days, Derrick's total doughnut production for the month is 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts.

Given that each doughnut is sold at $2, Derrick's total earnings can be calculated as 3600 * 2 = $7200.

Therefore, Derrick's total earnings in June are $7200."
"To determine the number of days required to upload all the photos, we can utilize the concept of division. 

The total number of photos, 210, is to be divided by the number of photos uploaded per day, 7. This can be represented as:

Therefore, Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.

The final answer is $47."
"To calculate the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first determine the total number of words in 10 pages. Since each page has 450 words, the total number of words in 10 pages is 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

Next, we need to convert John's speaking speed from words per minute (WPM) to words per second (WPS). There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we can convert WPM to WPS by dividing by 60: 375 WPM / 60 = 6.25 WPS.

Now, we can calculate the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at 6.25 WPS by dividing the total number of words by the speed: 4500 / 6.25 = 720 seconds.

To convert the time from seconds to minutes, we can divide by 60: 720 / 60 = 12 minutes.

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages."
"To calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we can break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, we need to find the number of people on the first three days. We know that on the first day, there were 50 people. On the second day, 20 more people were present, so the total number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70. On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, which is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people for the remaining four days. Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week, so the total number of people for those days is 60 * 4 = 240.

To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add up the number of people for the first three days and the remaining four days: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the total number of kernels popped, we can break down the problem into four distinct intervals and calculate the number of kernels popped in each interval.

Let's denote the initial rate of popping as 'r'. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop, which can be expressed as 20 = r * 0.5. Solving for 'r', we get r = 20 / 0.5 = 40 kernels per second.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to 3 times the initial rate, which is 3r = 3 * 40 = 120 kernels.

In the subsequent 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to 4 times the initial rate, resulting in 4r = 4 * 40 = 160 kernels.

Finally, in the last 30 seconds, the popping rate decreases to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, yielding 0.5r = 0.5 * 160 = 80 kernels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of kernels popped:
20 + 120 + 160 + 80 = 360 kernels

However, a quarter of the kernels popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. A quarter of 80 is 80 / 4 = 20 kernels.

Therefore, the total number of kernels Garrett has to eat is 360 + 20 = 380 kernels.

The final answer is: $\boxed{380}$"
"To determine the total number of lemons required, we can break down the problem into two parts: the standard 4 gallons and the additional gallon that is twice as tart.

First, let's calculate the number of lemons needed for the standard 4 gallons. Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup, we can set up a proportion to find the number of lemons needed for 4 gallons:

6 lemons / 1 cup = x lemons / 4 cups

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 6 lemons/cup * 4 cups
x = 24 lemons

Now, we need to calculate the number of lemons required for the additional gallon that is twice as tart. Since it requires half the amount of juice, we can multiply the number of lemons needed for 1 cup by 2:

2 * 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons

To find the total number of lemons required, we add the lemons needed for the standard 4 gallons and the additional gallon:

24 lemons + 12 lemons = 36 lemons

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the total weekly consumption of dog food, we must first calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The daily consumption of German Shepherds is 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg/day. Similarly, the daily consumption of Bulldogs is 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg/day. 

The total daily consumption is the sum of these two values: 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg/day.

To find the total weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To calculate the total number of pairs of animal legs, we can utilize the concept of weighted averages. We have 10 two-legged animals and 15 four-legged animals. 

First, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:
- Two-legged animals: 10 * 2 = 20 legs
- Four-legged animals: 15 * 4 = 60 legs

Now, we can find the total number of legs by adding the legs of both types of animals:
Total legs = 20 + 60 = 80 legs

Since each pair consists of two legs, we can find the total number of pairs by dividing the total number of legs by 2:
Total pairs = Total legs / 2 = 80 / 2 = 40 pairs

Therefore, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of red blocks as 'r'. We know that the total number of blocks is 32, and the number of blue blocks is 4, while the number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, which is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blocks can be represented by the equation: 4 (blue blocks) + 8 (yellow blocks) + r (red blocks) = 32.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12 + r = 32.

Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation, we get: r = 20.

Therefore, the number of red blocks is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the distance Elvis is from his house, we can utilize the concept of relative motion. Since Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18mph, we can calculate the distance he covered in that direction.

Distance = Speed × Time
= 18mph × 5 hours
= 90 miles

Next, Elvis turned around and traveled east for 8 hours at the same speed. The distance he covered in this direction is:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 18mph × 8 hours
= 144 miles

To find the net distance from his house, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:

Net Distance = Distance Traveled East - Distance Traveled West
= 144 miles - 90 miles
= 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

The final answer is: 54"
"To calculate the value of the boat after three years, we can use the formula for depreciation:

Value after n years = Initial value * (1 - Depreciation rate)^n

In this case, the initial value is $9000, the depreciation rates are 30% in the first year, 30% in the second year, and 20% in the third year.

We can calculate the value after each year as follows:

Year 1:
Value after 1 year = $9000 * (1 - 0.3) = $9000 * 0.7 = $6300

Year 2:
Value after 2 years = $6300 * (1 - 0.3) = $6300 * 0.7 = $4410

Year 3:
Value after 3 years = $4410 * (1 - 0.2) = $4410 * 0.8 = $3528

Therefore, the boat is worth $3528 after three years.

Final Answer: $3528"
"To determine the number of pink candies, we must first calculate the number of orange and yellow candies.

The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so:
Orange candies = 2 * 54 = 108

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so:
Yellow candies = 54 / 2 = 27

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
Red + Orange + Yellow = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
232 - 189 = 43

Therefore, the number of pink candies is 43."
"To calculate the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to determine the cost of the bus trips first. Since each bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, we can express this relationship as a decimal: 0.10. 

The cost of one bus trip is 0.10 times the cost of one night at the hotel, which is $80. 

Cost of one bus trip = 0.10 * $80 = $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is:
$8 * 7 = $56

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is:
$80 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $136

Therefore, the total cost of Helen's trip is $136."
"To determine the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we can utilize the principle of subtraction. We know that the total number of marbles initially given by Mazie is 52, and Dallas ended up with 21 marbles after dropping 4. 

Let's denote the number of marbles given to Darla as 'x'. Since the total number of marbles initially given is 52, and Dallas initially had 25 marbles, we can set up the equation:

x + 25 = 52

To solve for 'x', we subtract 25 from both sides of the equation:

x = 52 - 25
x = 27

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the family's outing, we must consider the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately.

The cost of the tickets can be determined by multiplying the number of adult tickets by the cost per adult ticket, and then adding the cost of the child ticket. In this case, the calculation is as follows:

2 adult tickets × $12 per adult ticket = $24
$24 + $8 (child ticket) = $32

Next, we calculate the cost of the popcorns by multiplying the number of popcorns by the cost per popcorn:

2 popcorns × $3 per popcorn = $6

Finally, we add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns to determine the total cost:

$32 (tickets) + $6 (popcorns) = $38

Therefore, the family pays a total of $38.

The final answer is: $38"

"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we can utilize the formula for calculating the mean of two numbers: (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2.

Given that Mia is 40 years old and 16 years younger than Emma, we can determine Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can calculate the average age by substituting the values into the formula:

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average age of Mia and Emma is 48."

"To determine the total age of the siblings, we can break down the problem into manageable steps. 

First, we know the age of one brother is 12, and this is half the age of the older brother. Let's denote the age of the older brother as x. We can set up the equation:

12 = (1/2)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

x = 12 * 2
x = 24

Now that we know the ages of the brothers are 12 and 24, we can calculate the total age of the brothers:

Total age of brothers = 12 + 24
Total age of brothers = 36

We also know the ages of the sisters are all 16. To find the total age of all the siblings, we add the total age of the brothers to the total age of the sisters:

Total age of all siblings = Total age of brothers + Total age of sisters
Total age of all siblings = 36 + (3 * 16)
Total age of all siblings = 36 + 48
Total age of all siblings = 84

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we can break it down into two components: daily time and weekly time.

Daily time: 
Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 30 minutes. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on meditation per week is 30 minutes * 7 days = 210 minutes. Converting this to hours, we get 210 minutes / 60 = 3.5 hours.

Weekly time: 
She practices 1 hour of yoga 5 days a week, so the total time spent on yoga per week is 1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours.

Total time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 
3.5 hours (meditation) + 5 hours (yoga) = 8.5 hours.

Therefore, in 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation and yoga is 8.5 hours * 4 = 34 hours.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is equivalent to 3 * 12 = 36 seeds. 

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. Then, we add this value to the number of seeds in the small sunflower: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, we add the seeds from the small and large sunflowers: 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To determine the number of pens Sarah has, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the number of pens owned by Timothy and George, and then apply this relationship to find Sarah's pen count.

Given that George has 18 pens, and Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, we can express this relationship as a mathematical equation:

Let G = number of pens George has
Let T = number of pens Timothy has

T = 3G
T = 3(18)
T = 54

Now, since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can express this relationship as:

S = (1/2)(54)
S = 27

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To solve this problem, we can represent the information given as a system of linear equations. Let's denote Jackie's height before the summer as x. We know that Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, so her current height is x + 3"". We also know that she is 2"" shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert. Since Albert is 36"" tall, we can express Anne's height as 2 * 36"" = 72"". Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 3"" = 72"" - 2""

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 3"" = 70""

Subtracting 3"" from both sides, we get:

x = 70"" - 3""

x = 67""

So, Jackie's height before the summer was 67""."
"To calculate the total revenue from selling chocolate bars produced in two weeks, we can employ the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

First, we need to determine the total number of bars produced in 14 days. Since the company produces 5000 bars per day, we can multiply this rate by the number of days in two weeks (14 days).

Total bars produced = 5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70,000 bars

Next, we multiply the total number of bars by the price per bar ($2) to find the total revenue.

Total revenue = Total bars produced * Price per bar
= 70,000 bars * $2/bar
= $140,000

Therefore, the company will receive $140,000 for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks.

The final answer is: $140,000"
"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to break down the costs of the T-shirts and shoes separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8, and Jake buys 2 T-shirts. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Cost of T-shirts = (Cost of first T-shirt) + (Cost of second T-shirt)
= $8 + (50% of $8)
= $8 + (0.5 x $8)
= $8 + $4
= $12

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. We can calculate the discount as follows:

Discount on shoes = 40% of $40
= 0.4 x $40
= $16

Cost of shoes = Original price - Discount
= $40 - $16
= $24

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store:

Total amount spent = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes
= $12 + $24
= $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the number of movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to calculate his total earnings and then divide that by the cost of a single ticket.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are:
6 * 3 = 18

He also spent $1.25 on ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so the total cost of the ice cream cones is:
1.25 * 4 = 5

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings:
18 - 5 = 13

To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide his remaining amount by the cost of a single ticket:
13 ÷ 6.50 = 2

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To calculate the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani, we need to add up the costs of all the items purchased.

Ellen's purchases: 
- Leggings: $100
- Photo frame: $5
Total spent by Ellen: $100 + $5 = $105

Lani's purchases:
- Sunglasses: $30
- Two bathrobes: 2 * $100 = $200
Total spent by Lani: $30 + $200 = $230

To find the total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani, we add their individual totals: $105 + $230 = $335.

The final answer is: $335"
"To calculate the profit made by Tim from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we need to first determine the total cost of producing one jar and then multiply it by 10.

The cost of producing one jar consists of the costs of passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey. Given the respective prices of these ingredients are $6 per pound for passion fruit, $8 per pound for jackfruit, and $10 per pound for honey, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Cost of passion fruit per jar = 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
Cost of jackfruit per jar = 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
Cost of honey per jar = 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20
Total cost per jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, to find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:

Profit per jar = Selling price per jar - Total cost per jar
Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6
Total profit from 10 jars = Profit per jar * 10
Total profit from 10 jars = $6 * 10
Total profit from 10 jars = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"To calculate the total dollar amount in the jar, we can utilize the concept of place value and the respective values of each coin type.

First, let's calculate the value of each type of coin:

- 32 quarters = 32 * $0.25 = $8.00
- 95 dimes = 95 * $0.10 = $9.50
- 120 nickels = 120 * $0.05 = $6.00
- 750 pennies = 750 * $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add the values together:
$8.00 + $9.50 = $17.50
$17.50 + $6.00 = $23.50
$23.50 + $7.50 = $31.00

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the jar is $31.00."
"To determine the amount of money Janet has left, we must first calculate the total amount she spent. This can be achieved by adding the individual expenses:

Total amount spent = $3.50 (ice cream) + $7.50 (movie ticket for herself) + $7.50 (movie ticket for her sister) + $8.50 (bracelet)

Using the commutative property of addition, we can rearrange the terms to simplify the calculation:

Total amount spent = $3.50 + $7.50 + $7.50 + $8.50
= $3.50 + ($7.50 + $7.50) + $8.50
= $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50
= $27.00

Now, we can subtract the total amount spent from the amount her parents gave her:

Amount left = $40 (initial amount) - $27.00 (total amount spent)
= $40 - $27.00
= $13.00

Janet has $13.00 left."
"To calculate Josh's earnings over a 2-week period, we must first determine the total number of days he is open. Since Josh operates 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) and is closed on Wednesday and Sunday, we can calculate the total number of days he is open in 2 weeks as follows:

6 days/week * 2 weeks = 12 days

Next, we need to calculate the total number of cars he services in 12 days. Since Josh services 3 cars per day, we can multiply the number of days he is open by the number of cars he services per day:

3 cars/day * 12 days = 36 cars

Finally, we can calculate Josh's total earnings by multiplying the number of cars he services by his hourly wage:

36 cars * $4/car = $144

Therefore, Josh's total earnings over a 2-week period are $144."
"To determine the total number of cookies Randy has now, we can analyze the sequence of events:

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.

He eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This results in:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

Then, he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, leaving him with:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 sugar cookies (no change)

Next, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, resulting in:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner, adding:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

The total number of cookies Randy has now is 6 + 7 + 6 = 19.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the total amount Matthew would earn, we can calculate the earnings from each half of his collection separately and then add them together.

Let's break it down:

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, which can be divided into two equal halves. Each half consists of 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half (6 toys at $5 each), the total earnings can be calculated as:

6 * 5 = $30

For the second half (6 toys at $7 each), the total earnings can be calculated as:

6 * 7 = $42

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the earnings from both halves:

$30 + $42 = $72

Therefore, Matthew would earn a total of $72 if he agrees to the buyer's offer."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's 14-day vacation. Since the dog digs 6 holes per day, the total number of holes dug is:

6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Now, let's consider the net change in the number of holes per day. Nate fills in 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. Therefore, the net change in the number of holes per day is:

9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

To find the number of days it takes to fill the holes, we can divide the total number of holes by the net change in the number of holes per day:

84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks by dividing by 7:

28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

Final answer: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School by multiplying the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
Average enrollment at Butler High School = 3000

The difference in average enrollment can be found by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000
Difference in average enrollment = 1000

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 more than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate chip cookies, we can utilize the principle of subtraction. Given the total number of cookies and the quantities of rainbow and oatmeal cookies, we can calculate the number of chocolate chip cookies as follows:

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

Therefore, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We are given the following information:

1. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so T = 16 / 2 = 8.
2. Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.
3. The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29, so T + B + P = 29.

Substituting the values of T and P into the third equation, we get:

8 + B + 16 = 29

Simplifying the equation, we get:

B = 29 - 8 - 16
B = 5

However, we know that Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7. Since the calculated value of B is 5, we can set up an equation to represent the number of beakers Igor lost:

7 - B = number of beakers lost

Substituting the value of B, we get:

7 - 5 = 2

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we must first calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. Since each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws, we can calculate the total number of screws needed as follows:

Total screws needed = Number of tables × Number of legs per table × Number of screws per leg
= 4 × 4 × 2
= 32

Now, we subtract the total screws needed from the total screws James has:

Screws left over = Total screws - Total screws needed
= 40 - 32
= 8

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over."
"The problem at hand involves a simple arithmetic operation, specifically addition. We are tasked with finding the total number of eggs in two baskets. 

To solve this, we can apply the commutative property of addition, which states that the order of the addends does not affect the result. In this case, we can add the number of eggs in the first basket (10) to the number of eggs in the second basket (20).

Let's perform the calculation:

10 (eggs in the first basket) + 20 (eggs in the second basket) = 30

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To calculate the total amount of money raised, we can apply the principles of arithmetic to the given information. 

Let's denote the amount of money raised by Alexandra as A, Kim as K, Maryam as M, and Sarah as S. We are given the following information:

A = S + $400
K = A + $320
M = S + $400

We are also given the value of S: S = $300.

Now, we can substitute the value of S into the equations for A and K:
A = $300 + $400 = $700
K = $700 + $320 = $1020

Next, we can substitute the values of A and K into the equation for M:
M = $300 + $400 = $700

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money raised by adding the individual amounts:
Total = A + K + M + S
Total = $700 + $1020 + $700 + $300
Total = $2520

Therefore, the total amount of money raised is $2520."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative speeds and distances. Let's denote Aaron's speed as 'a' miles per minute and Vanessa's speed as 'v' miles per minute. We are given that Aaron's speed is twice that of Vanessa, so we can express this as:

a = 2v

We are also given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, which is twice the distance Aaron ran. Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as 'd'. Then, we can express this as:

d = 2

Now, we know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

For Aaron:

16 = d / a
16 = 2 / a
a = 2 / 16
a = 1/8 miles per minute

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can find Vanessa's speed by substituting the value of 'a' into the equation a = 2v:

1/8 = 2v
v = 1/16 miles per minute

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find her time by multiplying her distance by her speed:

Time = Distance * Speed
Time = 4 * (1/16)
Time = 4/16
Time = 1/4

The final answer is 1/4."
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that he requires 3 feet of line for every foot of dock and the existing dock measures 200 feet, we can calculate the required line length as follows:

Total line length = 3 * 200
Total line length = 600 feet

However, the caretaker already possesses 6 feet of line. To find the total amount he needs to purchase, we subtract the existing line from the total required:

Total line length needed = Total line length - Existing line
Total line length needed = 600 - 6
Total line length needed = 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant, we can break down the problem into its constituent parts. 

First, we need to determine the total daily revenue. Since the restaurant receives 6 reservations per night, and each reservation consists of 2 meals at $5 each, the total revenue from meals per night is 6 * 2 * $5 = $60. Adding the $5 bottle of wine, the total daily revenue becomes $60 + $5 = $65.

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, we can multiply the daily revenue by 2 to obtain the weekly revenue: $65 * 2 = $130.

Therefore, the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant is $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"To determine the selling price of each watermelon, we can use the formula for calculating the selling price with a given profit percentage.

Let's denote the cost price per watermelon as C and the selling price as S. We know that the profit percentage is 25%, which can be represented as 0.25 in decimal form.

The formula for calculating the selling price with a profit percentage is:

S = C + (C * Profit Percentage)

Substituting the given values, we get:

S = C + (C * 0.25)
S = C + 0.25C
S = 1.25C

We are given that the total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. To find the cost price per watermelon, we can divide the total cost by the number of watermelons:

C = Total Cost / Number of Watermelons
C = $80 / 50
C = $1.60

Now, we can substitute the value of C into the selling price formula:

S = 1.25C
S = 1.25 * $1.60
S = $2.00

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps and use algebraic expressions to represent the relationships between the ages of John, James, and Dora.

Let's denote John's current age as J, James' current age as S, and Dora's current age as D.

We know that James is twice as old as Dora, so we can write an equation:

S = 2D

We also know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is:

D = 12 - 3
D = 9

Substituting this value into the first equation, we get:

S = 2(9)
S = 18

Now, we know James' current age is 18. We also know that John had a son when he was 19, and James is now 18, so John's current age is:

J = 19 + 18 - 18
J = 19

However, this is not the correct way to find John's current age. We can use the fact that James is 18 and John had a son when John was 19 to find the age difference between John and James:

Age difference = 19 - 18
Age difference = 1

Since John's youngest son was born when John was 32, we can find John's youngest son's current age by subtracting the age difference from John's current age:

John's youngest son's current age = J - 1
John's youngest son's current age = 19 - 1
John's youngest son's current age = 18

Now, we can find John's youngest son's age in 3 years by adding 3 to his current age:

John's youngest son's age in 3 years = 18 + 3
John's youngest son's age in 3 years = 21

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, and Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange. 

Since they start at the same time, we can assume that they peel the same number of oranges in the first minute. 

Let's say they peel x oranges in the first minute. 

In the second minute, Ana will peel x - 1 oranges, and Jane will peel x oranges.

We can continue this pattern, and we can see that Ana will peel x - 1, x - 2, x - 3, and so on, oranges in each subsequent minute.

Jane will peel x, x, x, x, and so on, oranges in each subsequent minute.

Since they peel the same number of oranges in the first minute, the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane will be the same in each subsequent minute.

Let's calculate the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after an hour (60 minutes).

Ana's total time spent peeling oranges = 3x + 2(x - 1) + 2(x - 2) + ... + 2(1) 
= 3x + 2(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 59)
= 3x + 2(59*60/2)
= 3x + 11160

Jane's total time spent peeling oranges = x + x + x + ... + x (60 times)
= 60x

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is the difference between the sum of the number of oranges peeled by Ana and the sum of the number of oranges peeled by Jane.

Difference = (3x + 11160) - 60x
= -57x + 11160

Since x is the number of oranges peeled in the first minute, x must be a positive integer. 

However, the difference -57x + 11160 is negative for all positive values of x. This means that Ana will peel fewer oranges than Jane after an hour.

But we are asked to find how many more oranges Ana will peel than Jane, so the answer is 0.

Final Answer: The final answer is 0."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first determine the discounted price of the radiator. 

The original price of the radiator is $400. To find 80% of this amount, we multiply $400 by 0.8.

$400 * 0.8 = $320

This represents the discount amount. To find the discounted price, we subtract the discount from the original price.

$400 - $320 = $80

Next, we calculate the labor cost. The mechanic charges $50 per hour, and the installation takes 3 hours.

$50 * 3 = $150

Now, we add the discounted price of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

$80 + $150 = $230

The total cost Mark paid is $230."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote the number of chickens as x and the number of cows as y. We are given that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

x + y = 20

We are also given that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write another equation:

2x + 4y = 70

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations the same:

2x + 2y = 40

Now we can subtract the second equation from the modified first equation to eliminate x:

(2x + 2y) - (2x + 4y) = 40 - 70
-2y = -30
y = 15

Now that we have found y, we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find x:

x + 15 = 20
x = 5

Therefore, there are 5 chickens.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we calculate the total number of slices: 7 pizzas × 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices.

Next, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 slices ÷ 4 people = 14 slices/person.

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
