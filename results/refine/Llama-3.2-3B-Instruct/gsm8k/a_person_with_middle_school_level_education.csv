"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left. Then, she bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.

Since she sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fiber separately.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. The amount of white fiber is half of the blue fiber, so it's 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Total bolts = blue bolts + white bolts
Total bolts = 2 + 1
Total bolts = 3

The final answer is 3."
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. To find the new value, we multiply the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase).

New value = $80,000 * 2.5
= $200,000

Now, we subtract the original price from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

The final answer is: $120,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs per week, we need to multiply the number of sprints per week by the number of meters per sprint.

Number of sprints per week: 3
Number of meters per sprint: 60

Total meters per week = 3 * 60
Total meters per week = 180

James runs 180 meters per week."
"To find the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we need to add the feed given in the morning and afternoon.

Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups

Total feed so far: 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, we can multiply the total feed by the number of chickens to find the total daily feed needed.

Total daily feed: 40 cups * 20 chickens = 800 cups

Since Wendi has already given the chickens 40 cups of feed, we need to subtract that from the total daily feed to find the amount needed for the final meal.

Final meal feed: 800 cups - 40 cups = 760 cups

The final answer is: 760"
"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.
The cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is $50."
"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to follow the given information.

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into two parts: the first download and the second download.

First, Carla downloads 2 GB/minute for 80% of the file (since 40% is the point where the download is interrupted). 
80% of 200 GB is 0.8 * 200 = 160 GB.

Time taken for the first download = 160 GB / 2 GB/minute = 80 minutes.

Then, the download is interrupted and restarted. The second download also takes 80 minutes.

Total time taken = 80 minutes + 80 minutes = 160 minutes.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down the journey into segments.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. We can find the distance he traveled by multiplying the speed and time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. This doesn't change the distance he's from home.

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph. We can find the distance he traveled by multiplying the speed and time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

Finally, he drives for 2 hours at 80 mph. We can find the distance he traveled by multiplying the speed and time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

To find the total distance he's from home, we add the distances he traveled in each segment:

Total distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 160
Total distance = 355 miles

Since he initially drove 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:

Distance from home = Total distance - Initial distance
Distance from home = 355 - 180
Distance from home = 175 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings are:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Total earnings for the week:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

First, we know the program had 60 downloads in the first month. Then, the number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads. 

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54 downloads. So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, we add the downloads for each month to find the total: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Donuts: 3 dozen donuts * $68 per dozen = $204
Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen cupcakes * $80 per dozen = $160

Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

The tree costs $90 to plant, and it grows 7 lemons per year. Each lemon is sold for $1.50. So, the tree makes $10.50 per year from selling lemons. However, it costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year. The net profit is $10.50 (from selling lemons) - $3 (expenses) = $7.50 per year.

To find out how many years it takes to cover the initial cost of $90, we can divide the cost by the net profit: $90 ÷ $7.50 = 12 years.

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

Final answer: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more at the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she start with?

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold 1/3 of x at the green house, which is x/3. She sold 2 more at the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red house is x/3 + 2.

The number of vacuum cleaners remaining after selling at the green and red house is x - (x/3 + 2) = 2x/3 - 2.

She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/6 - 1.

The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is x/3 + 2 + x/6 - 1. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation: x - (x/3 + 2 + x/6 - 1) = 5.

To simplify the equation, we need to find a common denominator, which is 6. So, we can rewrite the equation as: x - (2x/6 + 12/6 - 6/6 - 1) = 5.

Combine like terms: x - (2x/6 + 5/6) = 5.

To get rid of the fraction, multiply both sides by 6: 6x - (2x + 5) = 30.

Distribute the 6: 6x - 2x - 5 = 30.

Combine like terms: 4x - 5 = 30.

Add 5 to both sides: 4x = 35.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 35/4.

x = 8.75.

Since you can't sell a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that x = 8.75 is not a whole number, but we can try to find the closest whole number that satisfies the equation.

Let's try x = 8 and x = 9.

If x = 8, then the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is 8/3 = 2.67, which is not a whole number. So, x = 8 is not a valid solution.

If x = 9, then the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is 9/3 = 3, which is a whole number. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the red house is 2. The number of vacuum cleaners remaining after selling at the green and red house is 9 - (3 + 2) = 4. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is 4/2 = 2. The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is 3 + 2 + 2 = 7. Since 9 - 7 = 2, which is not equal to 5, x = 9 is not a valid solution.

If x = 10, then the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is 10/3 = 3.33, which is not a whole number. So, x = 10 is not a valid solution.

If x = 11, then the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is 11/3 = 3.67, which is not a whole number. So, x = 11 is not a valid solution.

If x = 12, then the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is 12/3 = 4, which is a whole number. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the red house is 2. The number of vacuum cleaners remaining after selling at the green and red house is 12 - (4 + 2) = 6. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is 6/2 = 3. The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is 4 + 2 + 3 = 9. Since 12 - 9 = 3, which is not equal to 5, x = 12 is not a valid solution.

If x = 13, then the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is 13/3 = 4.33, which is not a whole number. So, x = 13 is not a valid solution.

If x = 14, then the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is 14/3 = 4.67, which is not a whole number. So, x = 14 is not a valid solution.

If x = 15, then the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is 15/3 = 5, which is a whole number. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the red house is 2. The number of vacuum cleaners remaining after selling at the green and red house is 15 - (5 + 2) = 8. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is 8/2 = 4. The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is 5 + 2 + 4 = 11. Since 15 - 11 = 4, which is not equal to 5, x = 15 is not a valid solution.

If x = 16, then the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is 16/3 = 5.33, which is not a whole number. So, x = 16 is not a valid solution.

If x = 17, then the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is 17/3 = 5.67, which is not a whole number. So, x = 17 is not a valid solution.

If x = 18, then the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is 18/3 = 6, which is a whole number. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the red house is 2. The number of vacuum cleaners remaining after selling at the green and red house is 18 - (6 + 2) = 10. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is 10/2 = 5. The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is 6 + 2 + 5 = 13. Since 18 - 13 = 5, x = 18 is a valid solution.

The final answer is 18."
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine which option is better, we need to calculate the potential value of each item after the market increase.

The jewelry will increase by 2.5%, so its new value will be:
$5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

The electronic gadgets will increase by 1.2%, so its new value will be:
$8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since $8,160 is more than $5,250, the electronic gadgets are a better choice.

The profit from the jewelry is $5,250 - $5,000 = $250.
The profit from the electronic gadgets is $8,160 - $8,000 = $160.

The merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances covered on the first day (westward) and the second day (northward).

The trains traveled 80 miles westward on the first day. On the second day, they traveled 150 miles northward. Since they traveled the same distance, each train covered 150 miles northward.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of the distances covered on both days:
80 + 150 = 230

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Jill gets paid $20 per hour to teach and $30 per hour to be a cheerleading coach. She works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in that time. 

Since Claire makes 3 eggs per day, we multiply 3 eggs by 28 days (since there are 7 days in a week and 4 weeks). 

3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 84 eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:

84 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs

The final answer is 7."
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we need to first find the time she has left to cover the remaining 6 miles.

Marissa has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in 1 hour. So, the total time she has spent so far is 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

Since Marissa wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to spend to achieve this average.

Total distance = 12 miles
Average speed = 4 miles per hour
Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 / 4
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour to maintain her desired average speed.

Now, we need to find the speed required to cover the remaining distance in 1 hour.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered so far
Remaining distance = 12 - (4 + 2)
Remaining distance = 12 - 6
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Speed required = Distance / Time
Speed required = 6 / 1
Speed required = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before and after spilling.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in 10 liters of orange drink is:
10 * (2/3) = 20/3 liters

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is:
15 * (3/5) = 9 liters

The total amount of water in both drinks initially is:
20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water left in the orange drink is:
20/3 - 1 = 17/3 liters

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
17/3 + 9 = 17/3 + 27/3 = 44/3 liters

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:
44 ÷ 3 = 14.67

The final answer is: 14.67"
"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to know how old Raymond is. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can find Raymond's age by subtracting 6 from Samantha's age.

Raymond's age = Samantha's age - 6
Raymond's age = 31 - 6
Raymond's age = 25

Now, we know Raymond's age and his son's age. To find out how many years ago the son was born, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age.

Years ago the son was born = Raymond's age - son's age
Years ago the son was born = 25 - 23
Years ago the son was born = 2

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."
"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers. Since each of them bought 1 DVD, we multiply the number of customers by the number of DVDs each bought: 3 x 1 = 3.

Next, let's calculate the number of DVDs sold to the next 2 customers. Since each of them bought 2 DVDs, we multiply the number of customers by the number of DVDs each bought: 2 x 2 = 4.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold to each group: 3 + 4 = 7.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7.

"To find out how much shorter the candle will be, we need to calculate the total number of hours it burns. 

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. Since it melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Final answer: 8"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to divide the discounted price by 0.75 (since 100% - 25% = 75% = 0.75).

Original price = Discounted price / 0.75

= $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items first.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final answer is: 2"

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. Henry stopped after 20 miles, so the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.

The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:
40 - 45 = -5 miles

However, since distance cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's re-calculate the distance between the first and second stops.

The distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 40 miles. The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so the distance from the first stop to the second stop is 20 + 15 = 35 miles.

The final answer is 35."
"To find the cost of the boots, we need to figure out how much the two pairs of heels cost together. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much, so it's 2 * $33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99. Since the boots cost five dollars less than the two pairs of heels, we subtract $5 from $99 to find the cost of the boots. 

$99 - $5 = $94.

The final answer is 94."
"To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we need to add 10 to his current age. 

We know that the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. Let's use this ratio to find their current ages. 

Let's say Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is 109."
"To find the average guess, we need to add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses. 

The first person guessed 80 jelly beans. The second person guessed 20 more than half of the first person's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60. The third person guessed 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, let's add the guesses together: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses: 240 ÷ 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per week, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day.

There are 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. So, we multiply 10 dogs by 0.5 hours:

10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily hours by 7:

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

The final answer is 35."
"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first find the number of silver coins. Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the clues given in the problem.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels. Then, we find out how many jewels Aaron has. Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels by dividing 40 by 2, which equals 20. Then, we add 5 to 20 to find out how many jewels Aaron has: 20 + 5 = 25.

Now that we know Aaron has 25 jewels, we can find out how many jewels Siobhan has. Since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, we subtract 2 from 25 to find out how many jewels Siobhan has: 25 - 2 = 23.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25.

25% of 4 = 4 * 0.25
= 1

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Total points scored = Points scored in the first 20 minutes + Points scored in the second 20 minutes

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since the yogurts are on sale for 4 for $5, we need to find out how much one yogurt costs. 

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts = 15 sets of yogurts
Since each set costs $5, the cost of one yogurt is $5 / 4 = $1.25

Now, we can multiply the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days by the cost of one yogurt:
60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he got from selling his Lego sets. He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left after buying the video games, so the amount he spent on video games and had left is $195 - $160 = $35.

Since he spent $35 on video games and had $5 left, he must have had $35 + $5 = $40 initially.

Now, we know John had $40 initially and spent $195 on Lego sets. To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we can divide the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets by the price of each set: 195 / 15 = 13.

However, the question asks how many Lego sets he still has. Since he sold all his Lego sets, he doesn't have any left.

The correct answer is: 0"
"To find John's speed, we need to calculate the total number of hours he runs in a week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in total.

Now, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is 10."
"To find out how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

We know Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is half of her running speed. So, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she spends 6 hours in total, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 = 2 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is 3 miles per hour * 2 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the given information:

We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age by multiplying Suzy's age by 2. 

Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. To find Brandon's iPhone age, we multiply Ben's iPhone age by 4.

Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone, we need to calculate the maximum distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

Since Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, and with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, we multiply 400 by 3 to get the distance with the gemstone: 400 × 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, we need to subtract the distance the dragon can breathe fire (1000 feet) from the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone (1200 feet) to find the distance she can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the number of pieces taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

Let's do the math:

Total number of pieces initially set out = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces
Remaining pieces = 14

Number of pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially set out - Remaining pieces
= 40 - 14
= 26

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26."
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to calculate how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left

Since each serving has 250 calories, we need to divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have.

200 ÷ 250 = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 300g, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving to find the total weight.

0.8 × 300 = 240g

So, you can eat 240g of chips."
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. So, the total revenue is:

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, let's find the total cost. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks, which costs $10.00. Since he makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, he used 1 pound of beeswax, and the cost of the wick is already included in the $10.00. So, the total cost is:

Total cost = $10.00

Now, let's find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of hours she spent on each day.

First, let's find out how many articles she wrote on Monday. She wrote 5 articles, and each article takes 4 hours. So, the total hours spent on Monday is 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

Next, let's find out how many articles she wrote on Tuesday. She wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. She wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, so on Wednesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she spent on each day: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially, we need to add the notes she had in her purse and the notes she used at work.

She had 80 notes in her purse and used 220 notes at work. 

80 + 220 = 300

However, she had 23 notes remaining. So, the total number of notes she had initially must be 300 + 23 = 323.

Since she initially had 80 notes in her purse, the number of notes in the package she purchased is 323 - 80 = 243.

The final answer is 243."
"To find the total amount spent on ties, we need to figure out the cost of the red ties first. We know that the blue ties cost $40 each and John bought 5 of them. So, the total cost of blue ties is 5 x $40 = $200.

Since the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of a blue tie and add it to the cost of a blue tie. 50% of $40 is $20. So, the cost of a red tie is $40 + $20 = $60.

John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he bought 5 x 2 = 10 red ties. The total cost of red ties is 10 x $60 = $600.

The total amount spent on ties is $200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to divide the total length of the wire (in inches) by the length of each piece.

First, let's convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply 4 feet by 12 inches per foot:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of occupied units, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total units in the building.

Total units = 15 floors * 8 units per floor
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can find the number of occupied units by multiplying the total units by 3/4.

Occupied units = 120 * 3/4
Occupied units = 90

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total units.

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Unoccupied units = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to calculate the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 mph x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

7.5 pounds

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove:

7.5 ÷ 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: 15"
"To find out which day the mechanic earned more money, we need to calculate the total amount earned from truck tires and car tires separately for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

Since $480 is greater than $520, the mechanic earned more money on Friday. To find the difference, we subtract the smaller revenue from the larger revenue: $480 - $520 = -$40. Since the result is negative, it means the mechanic earned less on Friday than on Thursday.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can multiply 12 by 3 to find Patchy's kittens. 

36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2.

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the remaining lollipops are:
30 - 2 = 28

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the maximum weight available for boxes by the weight of a single box to find the maximum number of boxes.

Maximum number of boxes = 245 / 15

To avoid any errors, we can use a calculator or estimate the result. Let's use a calculator.

Maximum number of boxes ≈ 16.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to add the 25% fee to the original bill. 

First, we calculate 25% of $40.00. To do this, we multiply $40.00 by 0.25. This gives us $10.00. 

Next, we add the $10.00 fee to the original bill: $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00. 

Then, we add the $3.00 delivery fee: $50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00.

"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the number of bad, sour, and unripe oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Now, subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges."
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to add the cost of the material, the construction, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500 and the construction is $800. To find the total cost so far, we add these two amounts together: $500 + $800 = $1300.

Next, we need to calculate the insurance cost. Janet pays 10% of the total cost, which is 0.10 x $1300 = $130.

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the total cost so far: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

Janet paid a total of $1430."
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break it down into two parts: the fixed pension for the first 20 years and the 5% of the pension value for the remaining 10 years.

First, let's calculate the total amount she receives in the first 20 years. Since her annual pension is $50,000, we multiply this by 20 years:

$50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000

After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension is $1,000,000. So, her annual pension after 20 years is:

$1,000,000 * 5% = $50,000

Since she quits after 30 years, she receives the fixed annual pension for 10 years and the 5% annual pension for 10 years.

The total amount she receives in the remaining 10 years is:
$50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000
$50,000/year * 5% = $2,500/year * 10 years = $25,000
Total amount = $500,000 + $25,000 = $525,000

Now, we add the total amount she received in the first 20 years and the total amount she received in the remaining 10 years:
$1,000,000 + $525,000 = $1,525,000

To find the average annual pension, we divide the total amount by the total number of years:
$1,525,000 / 30 years = $50,833.33

The final answer is: $50,833.33"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to find out how much she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in a half year, she paid:
140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. 10% of $140 is:
140 * 0.1 = $14
So, the amount she paid for the second half of the year is:
140 - 14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, she paid:
126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."

"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of players and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players is 2 teams per school * 5 players per team = 10 players per school.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 players per school * 4 schools = 40 players.

Each school also sent a coach, so the total number of coaches is 4 schools * 1 coach per school = 4 coaches.

The total number of people sent by the schools is the sum of the total number of players and coaches: 40 players + 4 coaches = 44 people.

"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone.

Let's start by finding the number of rubies. We know there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, we subtract 35 from the number of diamonds:

Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35
= 175 - 35
= 140

Next, we find the number of emeralds, which is twice the number of rubies:

Number of emeralds = 2 * Number of rubies
= 2 * 140
= 280

Now, we add up the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to find the total number of gems:

Total number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds
= 175 + 140 + 280
= 595

The final answer is 595."

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the amount of food used in the first 180 days and the amount used for the rest of the year.

For the first 180 days, Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food used in the first 180 days is:
1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

For the rest of the year (365 - 180 = 185 days), Cecilia feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food used in the rest of the year is:
2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

The total amount of food used in the first year is:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

"To find the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David, we need to know how much laundry each person does.

We know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can divide 400 by 4 to find out how much laundry David does.

David's laundry = 400 ÷ 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so we can divide 400 by 2 to find out how much laundry Raymond does.

Raymond's laundry = 400 ÷ 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry

"To find out how much water was left, we need to calculate the total amount of water the two girls got together. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate it as follows:

1/6 of 24 liters = 24 ÷ 6 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they got a total of 4 + 4 = 8 liters.

Now, we subtract the water the boy got from the total:

24 - 8 - 6 = 10 liters

So, there were 10 liters of water left.

The final answer is 10."
"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he had initially and then subtract the number of stickers he gave away and used.

Charlie initially had 10 stickers. Then, he bought 21 stickers, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers. After that, he got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers. He gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers. Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Charlie has 17 stickers left."
"To find Alex's weight, we need to multiply Grace's weight by 4 and then subtract 2.

Total number of thorns: 75 * 8 = 600

The total number of thorns is 600."
"To find the number of games won, we need to figure out how many games the team lost. Let's say the number of games lost is x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22. So, the sum of the number of games won and lost is 22.

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

So, the team lost 7 games. 

The number of games won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of shirts he has from each vacation.

Gene was 23 years old when he started vacationing and is now 34 years old. So, the number of years he has been vacationing is 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of shirts (and thus quilt blocks) is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44}$"
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the duration of each ring and add them up.

The first time it rang for 4 times. 
The second time it rang for 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.
The third time it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of times the alarm rang: 
4 + 12 + 6 = 22

The alarm rang 22 times in total."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the increase in her salary for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

Year 8:
Increase = 10% of $1169.23 = 0.1 * $1169.23 = $116.923
Salary after 8 years = $1169.23 + $116.923 = $1286.153

Year 9:
Increase = 10% of $1286.153 = 0.1 * $1286.153 = $128.6153
Salary after 9 years = $1286.153 + $128.6153 = $1414.7683

"To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount for adults and children separately.

First, let's calculate the amount for adults: 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs.

Next, we need to calculate the amount for children. Since a child eats half as much as an adult, we multiply the number of children by 5 lbs (half of 10 lbs). So, 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the amount for adults and children to find the total amount of potato salad needed: 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"

Gerald's new time = 36 * 0.9
Gerald's new time = 32.4 seconds

The final answer is 32.4."
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we need to first find the total number of girls in the class.

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 

Total students = 200
Number of boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept.

We can do this by multiplying 9 hours by 2/3.

9 hours * (2/3) = 6 hours

Since Harry slept 9 hours and James slept 6 hours, we can find the difference by subtracting the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept.

9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find the number of tomatoes used, we need to figure out how many ounces of tomatoes were used and then divide that by the number of ounces in each can.

We know that the sauce made 32 ounces, and it's half the volume of the tomatoes. So, we can multiply 32 by 2 to get the total ounces of tomatoes used.

32 * 2 = 64 ounces

Since each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces, we can divide the total ounces of tomatoes used by 16 to find the number of cans used.

64 ÷ 16 = 4 cans

Now, we know that each can contains 3 tomatoes. To find the total number of tomatoes used, we can multiply the number of cans used by 3.

"To find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that took an exit and the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as x.

We know that the total number of cars is 30, and 5 cars took an exit. So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he watched on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total time watched on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is equal to 90 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched. To do this, we divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes. 90 ÷ 30 = 3.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many cookies Henry baked last year. Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many cookies, so he bakes 2x cookies. However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually bakes 2x + 15 cookies. Then, he drops 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left.

We know that he has a total of 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first find the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The gas costs $3.00 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons. So, the total cost of the gas is:

Total cost of gas = Number of gallons * Price per gallon
Total cost of gas = 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons. So, the cashback amount is:

Cashback amount = Number of gallons * Cashback per gallon
Cashback amount = 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon
Cashback amount = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback amount from the total cost of the gas to find the total cost after the cashback rewards:

Total cost after cashback = Total cost of gas - Cashback amount
Total cost after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00
Total cost after cashback = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards will be $28.00."

"To find out how much water Julia's boat took on, we need to figure out how much water it takes on per second and then multiply that by the time it took her to reach the shore.

We know that Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so we can find her rowing speed:

Speed = Distance / Time
= 20 feet / 16 seconds
= 1.25 feet/second

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. To find the rate at which the boat takes on water, we can divide 2 liters by 10 feet:

Rate of water intake = 2 liters / 10 feet
= 0.2 liters/foot

Since we know Julia's rowing speed and the rate of water intake, we can find the total amount of water taken on by multiplying the rate by the time it took her to reach the shore:

Time to reach the shore = 64 seconds

Total water taken on = Rate of water intake * Time

"To find the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, add the total cost of both types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. 
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Now, calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:

"To find Adrien's current salary, we need to calculate 30% of his old salary and add it to his old salary.

30% of $40000 = 0.3 * 40000 = $12000
Adrien's current salary = $40000 + $12000 = $52000

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$40000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30769.23

Now, we need to find Lylah's current salary. Since her salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate 40% of her old salary and add it to her old salary.

40% of $30769.23 = 0.4 * 30769.23 = $12307.69
Lylah's current salary = $30769.23 + $12307.69 = $43077.92

Now, we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their current salaries.

Friday: 5 + 1 = 6 hours
Saturday: 6 + 1 = 7 hours
Sunday: 7 + 1 = 8 hours

Total hours slept: 8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 40 hours

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts.

First, let's calculate the distance covered at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. We can do this by multiplying the speed (10 miles/hour) by the time (3 hours).

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Next, we need to calculate the distance covered at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours. We can do this by multiplying the speed (5 miles/hour) by the time (4 hours).

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, we add the two distances together to find the total distance covered in 7 hours.

Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

The total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is 50 miles."
"To find the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to figure out how many letters she stamped. 

Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, and there are 60 letters needing stamps, she stamped 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find the number of letters in the pile when Jennie began, we need to add the number of letters she stamped to the number of letters in the pile now.

So, the number of letters in the pile when Jennie began is 30 + 20 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought. We know that she had 12 spoons in the end, and her husband gave her 5 spoons. She also used 3 spoons to sample her stew.

Let's use a simple equation to solve for the number of spoons in the package Julia bought. We can say that the total number of spoons is equal to the number of spoons in the package plus the number of spoons her husband gave her, minus the number of spoons she used.

Let x be the number of spoons in the package Julia bought. The equation would be:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

To solve for x, we can combine like terms:

x + 2 = 12

Subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 10

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages.

Number of chicken sausages = 38
Number of fish sausages = 6 more than chicken sausages
Number of fish sausages = 38 + 6 = 44

Total number of sausages = 38 + 44 = 82

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends, we need to add the number of friends Amy and Lily have.

Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends. So, Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Now, we add the number of friends Amy and Lily have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The total number of friends they have together is 120."
"To find the total cost of the items Dillon is buying, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, we know that a pepper costs 15$. Since a watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * 15 = 45$. 

An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is 45 - 5 = 40$.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dillon is buying:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers: 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges: 10 * 40 = 400$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total time spent on patients and the total revenue from patients and doctors.

First, let's find the total time spent on patients. There are 500 patients a day, and each patient is seen for 24 minutes. So, the total time spent on patients is:

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:

12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Now, let's find the total revenue from patients. Each patient pays $200, and there are 500 patients:

500 patients * $200/patient = $100,000

The doctors charge $150 per hour, and they work for 200 hours. So, the total revenue from doctors is:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from patients and doctors:

$100,000 + $30,000 = $130,000

Since there is no cost mentioned for the hospital, the profit is:

$130,000 - $0 = $130,000

The hospital makes a profit of $130,000."
"To find the number of elves left, we need to subtract the elves that quit from the total number of elves.

First, we find a third of the elves that quit after children vomit on them. A third of 60 is 60 ÷ 3 = 20. So, 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. We subtract 10 from the remaining 40 elves: 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

The number of elves left is 30."
"To find the total expenditure, we need to add the expenditure in May and June.

Expenditure in May = $500
Expenditure in June = $500 - $60 = $440

Total expenditure = $500 + $440 = $940

The final answer is: $940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.
They both rode the luge 2 times, so they used 2 * 6 * 2 = 24 tickets.

In total, they used 12 + 24 + 24 = 60 tickets.

The total number of tickets used that day is 60."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to calculate the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday first.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

The total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Since the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, we can subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

41 - 28 = 13

Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To find the total cost of car washes in a year, we need to multiply the number of car washes per month by the number of months in a year and then multiply by the cost of each car wash.

Let's do the math:

4 car washes/month * 12 months/year = 48 car washes/year
48 car washes/year * $15/car wash = $720/year

So, Tom pays $720 in a year for 4 car washes."
"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to first figure out how many video games Brian has after losing 5. Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Since Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, we can set up the equation:

Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5
Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

So, Bobby has 40 video games."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to calculate two thirds of the total number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. 

First, we find one third of the total number of unicorns: 27 ÷ 3 = 9. This means there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we multiply the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands by 2/3 to find the number of female Scottish unicorns: 9 × 2/3 = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns."
"To find the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the subs: 2 subs at $7.50 each is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00.

Next, we calculate the cost of the chips: 2 bags at $1.50 each is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00.

Then, we calculate the cost of the cookies: 2 cookies at $1.00 each is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00.

Now, we add the costs together: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

The delivery fee is 20% of the total cost, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00.

Finally, we add the delivery fee to the total cost: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip. So, the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To find the total number of questions Mark completed, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed in each test.

For the first test, Mark completed 5 questions per hour for 8 hours, so he completed 5 * 8 = 40 questions.

For the second test, Mark completed 5 questions per hour for 6 hours, so he completed 5 * 6 = 30 questions.

In total, Mark completed 40 + 30 = 70 questions.

Since the first test had 75 questions and Mark completed 70, he left 75 - 70 = 5 questions incomplete.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to multiply the number of blue gumballs by 4 and then add 22.

Number of blue gumballs = 12
Number of pink gumballs = 4 * 12 + 22
= 48 + 22
= 70

The number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

So, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To find the number of worker bees, we need to understand the relationships between the different types of bees in the hive. We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and there are twice as many babies as queens.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q. Since there are twice as many babies as queens, the number of babies is 2Q. And since there are twice as many worker bees as babies, the number of worker bees is 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

We also know that the total number of bees is 700. So, we can set up the equation: Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combining like terms, we get 7Q = 700. Dividing both sides by 7, we find that Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of worker bees: 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would work 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Since he earns $10 an hour, his total earnings in a week would be 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

So, Jordan would earn $140 in a week if he spent his video game time working."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of non-food items and add the cost of food items. 

First, let's find the total cost of non-food items. The items that are not food are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. The cost of these items is $3 + $3 + $4 = $10.

Next, we need to calculate the tax on these non-food items. The tax rate is 10%, so we multiply the cost by 0.10. The tax is $10 * 0.10 = $1.

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the non-food items. The total cost of non-food items with tax is $10 + $1 = $11.

The food items are milk and eggs, which cost $2 + $3 = $5.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of non-food items with tax and the cost of food items. The total cost is $11 + $5 = $16.

The final answer is: $16"
"To calculate Kim's profit, we need to find the total expenses and subtract it from his total income.

Kim has 8 clients, and each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, and the cost of cloths is $5 per pack.

Total bottles of bleach needed = 8 clients * 2 bottles per client = 16 bottles
Total cost of bleach = 16 bottles * $2 per bottle = $32

Total packs of cloths needed = 8 clients * 1 pack per client = 8 packs
Total cost of cloths = 8 packs * $5 per pack = $40

Total expenses = Total cost of bleach + Total cost of cloths
Total expenses = $32 + $40
Total expenses = $72

Kim's total income is $92. To find his profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income.

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per year.

There are 10 hectares of pineapple field, and each hectare has 100 pineapples. So, the total number of pineapples per year is:

10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples/year

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to multiply the total number of pineapples per year by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year):

1000 pineapples/year * 4 = 4000 pineapples/year

So, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.
The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first box, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box:
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

The final answer is: 2125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many bees left the hive in the first 6 hours. We know that 30 bees left in the first 6 hours.

Next, we need to find out how many bees returned in the next 6 hours. Since 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours returned, we can calculate this as 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.

Then, we need to find out how many bees left in the next 6 hours. Since 2 times as many bees as the first 6 hours left, we can calculate this as 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to find out how many bees left before the last 6 hours. We add the bees that left in the first 6 hours and the bees that left in the next 6 hours: 30 + 60 = 90 bees.

Finally, we need to find out how many bees returned in the last 6 hours. Since 15 bees returned in the previous 6 hours, we subtract 15 from the total number of bees that left before the last 6 hours: 90 - 15 = 75 bees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is:
$12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, she must have given the cashier $22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To find out how many friends James has, we need to figure out how many friends Dorothy has first. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can divide Charlie's friends by 3 to find Dorothy's friends.

Dorothy's friends = Charlie's friends ÷ 3
Dorothy's friends = 12 ÷ 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4.

James' friends = Dorothy's friends × 4
James' friends = 4 × 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out who will be waiting for whom, we need to calculate how long it takes each person to get home.

Steve lives 3 miles away from school, and he can bike at 440 feet per minute. We need to convert the distance to feet: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet. Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Steve to get home: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes.

Tim lives 2 miles away from school, and he can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute. We need to convert the distance to feet: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet. Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Tim to get home: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes.

Since Steve finishes first, Tim will be waiting for him. The time Tim will be waiting is the difference between their times: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"To find out how much change Carl gets, we need to calculate the total cost of the cookies and subtract that from the $10 bill he pays with.

Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack has 6 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies.

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost is 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill: $10 - $6 = $4.

So, Carl gets $4 as change.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that ants took 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. This means that before the ants took their french fry, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.

Next, a raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the remaining fries 'x'. Then, 1/3 of 'x' is 6. To find 'x', we can multiply 6 by 3, which gives us 18. So, the raccoon ate 2/3 of 18 fries, and 1/3 of 18 fries is 6. This means the raccoon ate 12 fries, leaving 18 - 12 = 6 fries.

Now, three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total. The remaining fries after the pigeons ate 9 fries is 6 - 9 = -3. Wait, that can't be right! Since we can't have a negative number of fries, we made a mistake. Let's recheck our math.

The pigeons ate 9 fries, but we know that there were 6 fries left after the raccoon ate. So, the pigeons must have eaten 6 + 9 = 15 fries. This means that the raccoon ate 2/3 of 15 fries, and 1/3 of 15 fries is 5. This means the raccoon ate 10 fries, leaving 15 - 10 = 5 fries.

Now, the seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. The remaining fries after the seagull ate 7 fries is 5 - 7 = -2. Again, we can't have a negative number of fries, so we made another mistake. Let's recheck our math.

The seagull ate 7 fries, but we know that there were 5 fries left after the raccoon ate. So, the seagull must have eaten 5 + 7 = 12 fries. This means that Dave ate 12 + 7 = 19 fries.

Finally, we know that Dave ate 14 fries initially, so the original amount of fries in the pack is 19 + 14 = 33.

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them up.

Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. That's 3 classes * 1 hour = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 days, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.

He also has 2 classes of 2 hours each on Tuesdays and Thursdays. That's 2 classes * 2 hours = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 days, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 9 hours/week * 16 weeks = 144 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 8 hours/week * 16 weeks = 128 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

The total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good and add them together.

First, let's calculate the length of the rolls. There are 300 rolls, and each roll is 4 inches long. We can convert the length of the rolls to feet by dividing by 12:
300 rolls * 4 inches/roll / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

Next, let's calculate the length of the croissants. There are 120 croissants, and each croissant is 6 inches long. We can convert the length of the croissants to feet by dividing by 12:
120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

Now, let's calculate the length of the baguettes. There are 60 baguettes, and each baguette is 2 feet long. Since they are already in feet, we don't need to convert them:
60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Finally, we add the lengths of all the baked goods together:
10 feet (rolls) + 10 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 140 feet

The total length of the baked goods is 140 feet."
"To find the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required for all the apes for 2 months.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas required:
400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who wins the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. Since he's running back and forth, he's covering the entire length of the field twice. So, his total distance is 15 * 2 * 100 yards = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. She does this 34 times. So, her total distance is 34 * (100 + 80) yards = 34 * 180 yards = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is greater than 3000 yards, Kelly wins.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 6120 - 3000 = 3120 yards.

The final answer is: 3120"

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know the tank had 17 feet of water on Monday. Then, on Tuesday, 7 feet more water was added, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

Next, we need to find two thirds of the depth on Tuesday. To do this, we multiply 24 by 2 and divide by 3. This can be written as (2/3) * 24.

To calculate (2/3) * 24, we can multiply 2 by 24 and then divide by 3. This gives us (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16.

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

Final answer: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Total number of fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

"To calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to find the price after every 2 months.

Initial price = $20
Increase after 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Increase after 4 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

Increase after 6 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Increase after 8 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.91
Price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47

Increase after 10 months = 20% of $41.47 = 0.20 * $41.47 = $8.29
Price after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76

Increase after 12 months = 20% of $49.76 = 0.20 * $49.76 = $9.95
Price after 12 months = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71

Increase after 14 months = 20% of $59.71 = 0.20 * $59.71 = $11.94
Price after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65

Increase after 16 months = 20% of $71.65 = 0.20 * $71.65 = $14.33
Price after 16 months = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98

Increase after 18 months = 20% of $85.98 = 0.20 * $85.98 = $17.20
Price after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18

Increase after 20 months = 20% of $103.18 = 0.20 * $103.18 = $20.64
Price after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82

Increase after 22 months = 20% of $123.82 = 0.20 * $123.82 = $24.76
Price after 22 months = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58

Increase after 24 months = 20% of $148.58 = 0.20 * $148.58 = $29.72
Price after 24 months = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30

Increase after 26 months = 20% of $178.30 = 0.20 * $178.30 = $35.66
Price after 26 months = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96

Increase after 28 months = 20% of $213.96 = 0.20 * $213.96 = $42.79
Price after 28 months = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75

Increase after 30 months = 20% of $256.75 = 0.20 * $256.75 = $51.55
Price after 30 months = $256.75 + $51.55 = $308.30

Increase after 32 months = 20% of $308.30 = 0.20 * $308.30 = $61.66
Price after 32 months = $308.30 + $61.66 = $369.96

Increase after 34 months = 20% of $369.96 = 0.20 * $369.96 = $73.99
Price after 34 months = $369.96 + $73.99 = $443.95

Increase after 36 months = 20% of $443.95 = 0.20 * $443.95 = $88.79
Price after 36 months = $443.95 + $88.79 = $532.74

The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $532.74."
"To find the total cost of all the toys, we need to know the cost of each item. We're given that one red car costs $4 and an action figure costs $5. We also know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

Let's start by finding the cost of the doll. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, we can multiply the cost of an action figure by 3 to find the cost of the doll:

Doll's cost = 3 * Action figure's cost
Doll's cost = 3 * $5
Doll's cost = $15

Now that we know the cost of the doll, we can find the total cost of all the toys. We have 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and 1 doll. We can multiply the number of each item by its cost and add them together:

Total cost = (5 red cars * $4) + (3 action figures * $5) + (1 doll * $15)
Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15
Total cost = $50

The final answer is $50."
"To figure out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to compare the money she would make by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, she'll lose 3 hours of freelance work, which means she'll lose $35 per hour. So, the total amount she'll lose is:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's look at the cost of hiring an accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the total amount she'll lose:

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

Final answer: $15"
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to add up the cost of all the accessories she bought.

The cost of the accessories is:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

So, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

77"
"To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs needed (15) by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting (3).

15 ÷ 3 = 5

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to get 15 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Seth's current age is x. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Brooke's age is x/2.

In 2 years, Seth's age will be x + 2, and Brooke's age will be x/2 + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 + x/2 + 2 = 28

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 2:

2x + 4 + x + 4 = 56

Combine like terms:

3x + 8 = 56

Subtract 8 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

So, Seth's current age is 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has and then add $2.

Ethel has $8. Twice the amount of money Ethel has is 2 x $8 = $16.
Jimmy has $2 more than twice the amount of money Ethel has, so Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18.

The final answer is $18."
"To find the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately.

Pancho walks 20 miles a day on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, the total miles he walks on weekdays is 5 * 20 = 100 miles.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles a day, and there are 2 weekend days. So, the total miles he walks on weekends is 2 * 10 = 20 miles.

To find the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we add the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 x $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
$25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The final answer is: $150."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of creature and add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of legs for each type of creature:

Spiders: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs
Insects: 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs
Mutant invertebrates: 3 mutant invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs

Now, let's add the number of legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of each bird.

We know that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old.

Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can add up the ages of all four birds: 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To figure out how much Jessica should pay each month, we need to add up the minimum payments for her debts. 

Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300, her credit card's minimum is $200, and her mortgage's minimum is $500. 

First, let's add these amounts together: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000. 

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to find 50% of $1000. 50% is the same as 0.5, so we multiply 0.5 by $1000 to get $500. 

Now, we add this 50% increase to the total minimum payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500. 

This is how much Jessica pays each month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply this amount by 12. 

$1500 x 12 = $18,000.

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato, then multiply it by the number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
Total time to prepare one potato: 1.5 minutes + 5 seconds = 1.5 + 0.0833 = 1.5833 minutes

Now, we multiply the total time to prepare one potato by the number of potatoes:
60 potatoes * 1.5833 minutes/potato = 94.999 minutes

To convert the total time to seconds, we multiply by 60:
94.999 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 5699.94 seconds

So, it will take Billy approximately 5699.94 seconds to finish prepping the potatoes.

Final answer: 5699.94"
"To find out how much Juan and his brother Carlos spent on lemons, we need to calculate the total cost of making lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and profit is the difference between revenue and cost, we can set up an equation:

Revenue - Cost = Profit
$10 - Cost = $25

To find the total cost, we can add $25 to both sides of the equation:
$10 + $25 = $35

This is the total cost for 1 gallon. Since they need lemons and sugar for each gallon, the cost of lemons and sugar for 1 gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

To find the total cost of lemons, we can divide the total cost by 1 gallon:
$35 ÷ 1 gallon = $35 per gallon

Since they need lemons for 1 gallon, the cost of lemons is $35.

The final answer is: $35"
"To find the number of Chinese girls, we need to subtract the number of Chinese boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Total number of Asians = 240
Number of Japanese = 80
Number of Chinese = Total number of Asians - Number of Japanese
= 240 - 80
= 160

Since the problem only asks for the number of Chinese girls, we need to subtract the number of Chinese boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of Chinese girls = Total number of Chinese - Number of Chinese boys
= 160 - 60
= 100

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how much money Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations, we need to calculate the amount he spends and subtract it from his total income.

Zaid's monthly income is 6000$.

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = $1500.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = $2000.

The total amount spent so far is $1500 + $2000 = $3500.

The remaining amount is $6000 - $3500 = $2500.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * $2500 = $1250.

The amount left after donation is $2500 - $1250 = $1250.

He gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700, so the total amount spent on these is $200 + $700 = $900.

The amount left after these expenses is $1250 - $900 = $350.

Therefore, Zaid will have $350 left after all these expenses and donations."
"To find the total number of crabs, we need to figure out how many crabs each person has.

We know Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can add up the number of crabs each person has: 
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find the total amount Lloyd earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each week and add them together.

Lloyd earns $10 an hour. He tutored 5 hours for the first week and 8 hours for the second week. 

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 5 hours = $50.
For the second week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 8 hours = $80.

Total earnings for the first two weeks = $50 + $80 = $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to find 1/4 of the total votes since the winner got 3/4 of the votes.

Number of votes the winner got = (3/4) * 80

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is:
80 - 60 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of red roses, we need to figure out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. Let's say the number of white carnations is x. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

We also know that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies. So, we can set up the equation:

5x = 200

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 200 ÷ 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, the number of red roses is 4x:

Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To find Jean's age, we need to figure out Mark's age first. We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. Since Jan is 30 years old, half of her age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15. So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.

Now, we know that Mark is 2 years older than Jean. To find Jean's age, we add 2 to Mark's current age. Mark is 20 + 2 = 22 years old. So, Jean is 22 + 2 = 24 years old.

The final answer is 24."
"To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together.

The first runner runs 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team's time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (6).

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes (2, 4, and 6) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (6).

Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = (2/6) * (2/6) = 4/36 = 1/9 = 0.1111

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities and express it as a percentage.

Difference in probability = (0.5 - 0.1111) * 100% ≈ 0.3889 * 100% ≈ 38.89%

So, Jerry is approximately 38.89% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: 38.89%"
"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mom.

Jenna's mom picked 20 apples. Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, so Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

Total number of apples picked = 20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30 apples.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the number of rats in each cage, we need to first calculate the total number of straw pieces used for the rats. We know that there are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. There are also 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits. So, the total straw used for the hamsters and rabbits is 10 * 5 + 20 = 50 + 20 = 70.

Now, we subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used for the rats: 160 - 70 = 90.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we can divide the total straw used for rats by 3 to find the number of straw pieces per cage: 90 / 3 = 30.

Now, we know that each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. To find the number of rats in each cage, we divide the straw pieces per cage by 6: 30 / 6 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the interest, we need to find 2% of $100. 

2% of $100 = 0.02 * $100 = $2

Since Mandy paid the debt after 3 months, we multiply the interest by 3.

Total interest = $2 * 3 = $6

Now, we add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.

Amount to be paid = Principal + Total interest
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6
Amount to be paid = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To find the number of bags of wheat the trader sold, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold. The selling price per bag is $30, and the cost per bag is $20. The cost of transportation is $2 per bag. So, the total cost is $20 (cost per bag) + $2 (transportation cost) = $22 per bag.

Let's use 'x' to represent the number of bags sold. The total revenue is 30x, and the total cost is 22x. The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is 400. So, we can set up the equation:

30x - 22x = 400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
8x = 400

To find the number of bags sold, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 400 / 8
x = 50

The trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total cost of the food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets.

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

The total cost of the rides is $66.

Now, we need to find the total cost of all expenses.
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.
Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of hours he collects peaches by the number of peaches he can collect per hour.

First, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he can collect per minute: 180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to divide the total amount of insects they need per week by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

"To find the total number of trees Tom plants in 10 years, we need to multiply the number of trees he plants per year by the number of years.

10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees

Since Tom chops down 2 trees a year, we subtract the total number of trees he chops down from the total number of trees he planted:

100 trees - 20 trees = 80 trees

Now, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 80 trees, we multiply 80 by 0.3:

80 * 0.3 = 24 trees

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees Tom has:

80 trees - 24 trees = 56 trees

The final answer is 56."
"To find the difference between the number of pink plastic flamingos and white plastic flamingos, we need to calculate the number of flamingos that were left after the neighbors took one third of them back on Saturday.

There were initially 18 pink plastic flamingos. The neighbors took one third of them back, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the number of pink plastic flamingos left is 18 - 6 = 12.

On Sunday, 18 more pink plastic flamingos were added to the collection. So, the total number of pink plastic flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white plastic flamingos is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink plastic flamingos and white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

There are 6277 children in Soda."
"To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them together.

In the first month, Elaine collected 3 times the number of cards she initially had, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month: 
20 (initial cards) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards."
"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to figure out how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so we can multiply the number of sentences by the rate to find the amount Mark earns from Publisher A:

500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so we can multiply the amount Mark earns from Publisher A by 2:

2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we can add the amounts he earns from both publishers:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to multiply the number of acres by the number of tons produced per acre, and then multiply that by the number of barrels produced per ton.

First, we multiply 10 acres by 5 tons/acre: 10 * 5 = 50 tons
Then, we multiply 50 tons by 2 barrels/ton: 50 * 2 = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"Carl's favorite food is cheese. He ate a sandwich every day this week for lunch and used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.

To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

For lunch, Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. So, he used 7 * 2 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. So, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

For dinner, Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (dinner) = 31 slices of cheese.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens in each color and add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of pens in the blue bags:
6 bags of blue pens * 9 pens per bag = 54 blue pens

Next, let's calculate the number of pens in the red bags:
2 bags of red pens * 6 pens per bag = 12 red pens

Now, let's add the number of pens of each color:
22 green pens + 10 yellow pens + 54 blue pens + 12 red pens = 98 pens

Janet now has 98 pens."
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we need to calculate the total score she needs for an average of 93. 

First, let's add up the scores of the first five tests: 
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score. The lowest score is 71. 

Now, let's subtract 71 from the total score: 
438 - 71 = 367

Since Brinley wants an average of 93, we need to find the total score for six tests. 
To do this, we multiply the desired average by 6: 
93 × 6 = 558

Now, let's subtract the total score of the first five tests from the desired total score: 
558 - 367 = 191

So, Brinley needs a score of 191 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

The final answer is 191."
"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the kilometers he rode in two different periods.

In the first period, Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks. 
5 times a week * 4 weeks = 20 times
20 times * 25 kilometers = 500 kilometers

In the second period, Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks.
2 times a week * 3 weeks = 6 times
6 times * 60 kilometers = 360 kilometers

Total kilometers = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: 2600"
"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought 3 times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 x 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 x 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To find the cost of each cup, we need to first find the total cost of 20 dozen cups. We know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is 3 plates. 

The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000. Since 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than this, we subtract $1200 from $18000 to get the total cost of 20 dozen cups: $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

Now, we need to find the cost of each cup. There are 12 cups in a dozen, so 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups. To find the cost per cup, we divide the total cost by the number of cups: $16800 ÷ 240 cups.

$16800 ÷ 240 cups = $70 per cup.

The final answer is: $70"
"To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn.

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 = $50.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $50 - $10 = $40 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $40, we can divide $40 by $5, which is 8 sessions.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing sessions. Since she earns $4 per session, we can divide $40 by $4, which is 10 sessions.

Since 8 babysitting sessions would not be enough to cover the cost, we need to find the least common multiple of 8 and 10. The least common multiple of 8 and 10 is 40.

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to earn $40.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of red chickens Jerry has. Let's use variables to represent the number of red chickens and white chickens. We'll say the number of red chickens is 'r' and the number of white chickens is 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is 42. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as:

3r + 5w = 42

We can substitute w = r + 2 into the equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all its sides. Since the park is a rectangle, we add the lengths of all four sides:

Perimeter = 2(length + width)
Perimeter = 2(1.5 + 6)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the number of customers on the first two days.

Let's start by finding the number of customers on the second day. We know that Sloane counted 50 more customers on the second day than on the first day. Since she counted 100 customers on the first day, she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers on the second day.

Now, we can find the total number of customers on the first two days by adding the number of customers on the first and second days: 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have two pools, and both are leaking at 4 gallons/minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Then, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking, the amount of water in both pools has decreased by 4 gallons/minute for the past 4 minutes. So, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Then, the big pool has 4y gallons of water now.

We can set up two equations:

1) The small pool lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has x - 16 gallons of water. We are given that the small pool has y gallons of water now, so we can set up the equation: x - 16 = y.

2) The big pool lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has 2x - 16 gallons of water. We know that this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation: 2x - 16 = 4y.

We can solve the system of equations by substituting x - 16 for y in the first equation: x - 16 = 2x - 32. Adding 32 to both sides, we get x = 16.

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation x - 16 = y: 16 - 16 = y, so y = 0.

However, this doesn't make sense, as the amount of water in the small pool can't be 0. Let's re-evaluate our equations.

We can set up two new equations:

1) The small pool lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has x - 16 gallons of water. We are given that the small pool has y gallons of water now, so we can set up the equation: x - 16 = y.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to subtract the total cost of the items she wants to buy from her hourly wage.

Total cost of items = $320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00

Now, divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Lori needs to work 44 hours to make her purchase."
"To find out how much Janeth will owe after 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to pay. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount.

10% of $2000 is 0.1 x $2000 = $200. So, the total amount she needs to pay is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since she pays $165 per month for 12 months, we multiply $165 by 12 to find the total amount she will pay: $165 x 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to pay to find the remaining balance: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias.

We know there are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can find the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses.

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
= 4 + 7
= 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias.

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
= 4 + 11
= 15

The final answer is 15."
"To find the average age of the three in three years, we need to find their current ages and add them up, then divide by 3.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

The average age of the three in three years will be (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34.
Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. 
Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna.
68 + 44 + 85 = 197

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the points scored by the other three students from the total points.

"To find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we need to subtract 90 from the initial amount of 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Then, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, we multiply 30 by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

Now, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

Final answer: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias.

"To find the total number of days for the round trip, we need to calculate the number of days for each leg of the trip.

The bus trip from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days. Since the return trip is by car, which takes half as many days as the bus trip, the car trip from Rochester to New Jersey will take 6 / 2 = 3 days.

To find the total number of days for the round trip, we add the days for each leg: 6 (bus trip) + 3 (car trip) = 9 days.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

He starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

He loses 8 water type cards, so the new number of water type cards is 40 - 8 = 32.
He buys 14 grass type cards, so the new number of grass type cards is 20 + 14 = 34.

Now, the total number of cards is 90 - 8 + 14 = 96.

The number of water type cards is 32.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%. Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

The final answer is 33."
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to add up the costs of each item.

The base burrito costs $6.50. Chad adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, and avocado for $1.00. He also gets 2 sauces for $0.25 each, so that's 2 x $0.25 = $0.50. The upgrade costs $3.00.

Let's add up the costs:
$6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50
$8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50
$9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50
$10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00
$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00."
"To find out how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place per minute.

The total number of pieces is 360. They can place 6 pieces per minute (4 pieces per minute for Kalinda and 2 pieces per minute for her mom).

Time = Total pieces / Pieces per minute
Time = 360 / 6
Time = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

Time (in hours) = 60 / 60
Time (in hours) = 1 hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To find the number of watermelons ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home.

Now, let's find the number of watermelons remaining on the farm.

Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. To find the number of watermelons ready for harvest, we need to calculate 3/4 of 84.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest.

To find the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total remaining watermelons.

Watermelons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

First, let's calculate the cost of the cars. Mark buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000. So, the total cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

Next, we need to calculate the tax. Mark pays 10% tax on the cars. To find 10% of $240,000, we multiply $240,000 by 0.10. So, the tax is $240,000 * 0.10 = $24,000.

Now, let's calculate the registration fees. Mark pays $1,000 for registration on each of the 12 cars. So, the total registration fees are 12 * $1,000 = $12,000.

Finally, we add up the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees to find the total cost. $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to first find out how many shells she collected on Monday. 

Since Robert collects 20 shells and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to first find the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can divide the number of ants by 2.

Number of ants = 50
Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we need to add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects.

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
= 50 + 25
= 75

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we need to subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number of penguins.

There are 36 penguins initially. One-third of them (12 penguins) jumped in the ocean, and another one-third (12 penguins) went inside the cave to eat their dinner. 

So, the total number of penguins that left is 12 + 12 = 24 penguins.

To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still left sunbathing."
"To find out how many tomatoes Steve eats per week, we need to multiply the number of tomatoes he eats per day by 7.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of that amount, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Now, we need to find out how many vines are needed to produce 42 tomatoes per week. Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide 42 by 3 to get the number of vines needed.

42 ÷ 3 = 14

So, Steve needs 14 vines to produce enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend.

Final answer: 14"
"To figure out how many pizzas John needs, we need to divide the total number of slices he wants (20 friends * 4 slices per friend) by the number of slices per pizza (8).

Let's do the math:

20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices needed
80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To find out how many pens Ram can make, we need to divide the total number of pens by 5, since he can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens.

25 pens ÷ 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since Ram already has 25 pens, we need to add the 5 full pens he can make to the original 25 pens.

25 (original pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens

So, Ram will have a total of 30 pens."
"To find the final amount of money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps:

First, we add the initial $20 to the extra $10 he received, which gives us $20 + $10 = $30.

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow the steps below:

First, we calculate 30% of 1000 to find the number of students who went out through exit A. This is done by multiplying 1000 by 0.3.

Number of students who went out through exit A = 1000 * 0.3 = 300

Next, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit A from the total number of students to find the remaining students.

Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700

Then, we calculate 3/5 of the remaining students to find the number of students who went out through exit B.

Number of students who went out through exit B = (3/5) * 700 = 420

Finally, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students to find the number of students who went out through exit C.

Number of students who went out through exit C = 700 - 420 = 280

The number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candies Robert has and then compare it to James' candies.

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can divide 54 by 2 to find out how many candies Robert has.

54 ÷ 2 = 27

So Robert has 27 candies.

Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we can add 6 to Robert's total:

27 + 6 = 33

So James has 33 candies.

Now, we can compare the number of candies John and James have:

John has 54 candies, and James has 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' total from John's total:

54 - 33 = 21

John has 21 more candies than James.

"To find the total number of books Dolly and Pandora will read, we need to add the number of books each person has and the number of books they will read from the other person.

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book. Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book. 

So, the total number of books Dolly will read is 2 (her own books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 4 books.

The total number of books Pandora will read is 1 (her own book) + 1 (Dolly's book) = 2 books.

The total number of books they will collectively read is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

Since Mike receives 3 letters per week and sends 3 letters per week, he writes a total of 3 + 3 = 6 letters per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, we can find the total time he spends writing per week by multiplying the number of pages by the time it takes to write one page: 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 180 minutes ÷ 60 = 3 hours.

The final answer is: 3"

Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days. So, the total minutes used for this call is:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

He also had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, the total minutes used is:
450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (for other people) = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan:
1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Griffin had 24 french fries initially. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Let's say Ginger gave Griffin x fries. After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Griffin was left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries, so we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.

To solve for x, we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 27 - 7.

x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

Final answer: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of fish in each aquarium. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 28. Since there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in the other, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. The total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28. According to the problem, this difference is equal to twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since there are 14 fish in each aquarium, and the question asks for the number of fish in each aquarium, we can conclude that there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

Final answer: 14"
"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours worked and then apply the discount.

She works 6 hours a day, 4 days a week, so the total hours worked per week is 6 * 4 = 24 hours. Since the movie takes 5 weeks to finish, the total hours worked is 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour, so the total cost without discount is 120 * 250 = $30,000.

A 10% discount is given, so we need to find 10% of $30,000. To do this, we multiply $30,000 by 0.1, which is the same as 10%.

$30,000 * 0.1 = $3,000

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"

Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

The final answer is $32."
"To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply by the cost per pound.

Number of bags: 4
Weight per bag: 50 pounds

"To find out how many cookies Sue ate, we need to calculate the number of cookies she ate on Monday and Tuesday. 

Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, we multiply her sister's cookies by 4. 
Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies
Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies
Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

Now, we need to find out how many calories Sue and her sister consumed. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we multiply the total number of cookies by 200.
Calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the calories consumed by her sister from the calories consumed by Sue.
Calories consumed by Sue more than her sister = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, the total number of girls is 50% of 3 classes, which is 1.5 classes.

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls is 1.5 * 20 = 30 girls.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

This means that the third class has 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

Since there are 3 classes, the number of boys in each class is 30 / 3 = 10 boys.

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 10."

The final number of apps on Travis' tablet is 70."
"To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of wolves and cougars Rick killed each day.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves.

Today, he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.

Now, we add up the total number of animals Rick killed:

Wolves: 10 (last night) + 45 (today) = 55 wolves
Cougars: 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27 cougars

Total number of animals Rick killed: 55 wolves + 27 cougars = 82 animals.

The final answer is: 82"

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Since Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply 21 by 4 to find out how many times Robert went down the slide.

21 * 4 = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we need to first find the total number of cows in all 20 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows.

Initially, there were 20 cows in each stall, so the total number of cows in 20 stalls is:
20 stalls * 20 cows/stall = 400 cows

After Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, the total number of cows becomes:
400 cows + 40 cows = 440 cows

Since the cows are divided equally among the 20 stalls, we can divide the total number of cows by 20 to find the number of cows in each stall:
440 cows / 20 stalls = 22 cows/stall

Now, to find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8:
22 cows/stall * 8 stalls = 176 cows

- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2

Now, let's add the values together: $1 + $2 + $2 = $5
Then, add the value of the dollar bills: $5 + $40 = $45

Brady has $45 in his piggy bank."
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.30 (which is equivalent to 30%):

8000 pounds * 0.30 = 2400 pounds

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood to find the weight of the remaining wood:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds.

"To find the total amount Nancy owes, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the overdue books: 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

Next, we add the flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book over a week overdue. 

$4.00 (overdue books) + $2.00 (flat fee) = $6.00

So, Nancy owes a total of $6.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has and then add the number of fruits Andrea has.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find out how many apples Jamal has by subtracting 8 from 52:
52 - 8 = 44

Jamal has 44 apples.

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can find out how many bananas Jamal has by adding 4 to 44:
44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find out how many bananas Andrea has by dividing 48 by 2:
48 ÷ 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have:
Andrea: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits
Jamal: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits

The total number of fruits is 76 + 92 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then divide that by 12 (since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies).

Total number of cookies = 36 (today) + 30 (tomorrow) = 66 cookies

Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 x $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Total price of the house: $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference is:
$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

First, we calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 is $12,000. Then, we calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 is $20,000. The total amount paid is $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000. 

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

The final answer is: $32,000"
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil and the time it takes to cook the chicken.

First, let's find the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. It takes 20 minutes to heat up the oil, and then it takes 40% longer than that. 40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. So, the total time to heat up the oil is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Next, we need to find the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to warm up the oil. So, the time to cook the chicken is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

The total time is the sum of the time to heat up the oil and the time to cook the chicken. Total time = 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

The final answer is: 51"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we need to multiply the cost per ad ($5) by the number of ads (50). This can be calculated as:

$5 * 50 = $250

To find the total amount spent on television ads, we multiply the cost per ad ($75) by the number of ads (15):

$75 * 15 = $1125

Now, we add the cost of newspaper ads and television ads to find the total amount spent on all ads:

$250 + $1125 = $1375

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know the juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls. So, we divide 16 by 2 to find the number of golf balls: 16 ÷ 2 = 8.

Now, we know that half of the golf balls are blue. To find the number of blue golf balls, we divide the number of golf balls by 2 again: 8 ÷ 2 = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 blue golf balls."
"To find the total number of M&Ms, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows separately. 

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms. There are 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each, so we multiply the number of houses by the number of bedrooms per house and then by the number of windows per bedroom: 
2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows

Next, we calculate the number of additional windows. There are 2 houses with 4 additional windows each, so we multiply the number of houses by the number of additional windows per house: 
2 houses * 4 additional windows per house = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows: 
12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the change, we need to subtract the total cost of the items from the amount paid. 

The total cost is $4.20 (cocoa) + $9.45 (laundry) + $1.35 (pasta) = $14.99. 

The amount paid is $20. 

$20 - $14.99 = $5.01

The cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first find the total number of stitches for the collar and rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

To find the number of stitches for the two sleeves, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater:
1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:
630 ÷ 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 315."
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40/packet, which equals $800. The cost of the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30/packet, which equals $2400.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400, which equals $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines from each scene and the song.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, we add up the lines from the song and both scenes: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to follow the steps:

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we multiply 80 by 2/5.

80 * (2/5) = 32

The remaining cards are 80 - 32 = 48.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we multiply 48 by 1/2.

48 * (1/2) = 24

The remaining cards are 48 - 24 = 24.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we multiply 24 by 5/8.

24 * (5/8) = 15

The remaining cards are 24 - 15 = 9.

Since the remaining cards had the letter D, the number of cards with the letter D is 9.

The final answer is 9."
"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
240 minutes ÷ 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. However, the problem doesn't provide that information.

Let's say their current ages are x and y. We know that the sum of their ages is 20, so we can write an equation:

x + y = 20

We also know that in 10 years, their ages will be x + 10 and y + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (y + 10). We can simplify this expression by combining like terms:

x + y + 10 + 10 = x + y + 20

Since x + y = 20, we can substitute this into the equation:

20 + 20 = 40

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. We can write this as an equation: R = 6S, where R is Ruby's age and S is Sam's age.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. We can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now, we can substitute R = 6S into the second equation: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides: 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides: 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3: S = 6.

So, Sam is 6 years old.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately.

The cost of the popsicles is 20 popsicles * $0.25 = $5.
The cost of the ice cream bars is 4 ice cream bars * $0.50 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs together: $5 + $2 = $7.

So, Peter paid a total of $7."
"To find the total number of spots, we need to first find the number of spots on the mambas. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, so the total number of spots is:
40 cobras * 70 spots = 2800
60 mambas * 35 spots = 2100
Total spots = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Half the number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To find the total number of people, we need to calculate the number of team members, coaches, and their guests.

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 guests. So, the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24.

The total number of people is 12 (team members) + 3 (coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be 13 * $15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to calculate the total space between the topaz gemstones. Since there are 8 topaz gemstones, and each is 1 inch long, the total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the topaz gemstones take up 8 inches, so the space between the gemstones is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can divide the total space between the gemstones (17 inches) by the length of each bead (1/4 inch) to find the number of beads used:

17 ÷ 1/4 = 17 x 4 = 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"To find the total number of stories written, we need to calculate the number of stories each child wrote in the second week and add them to the number of stories they wrote in the first week.

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories.

In the second week, Alani doubled her stories from the first week, so she wrote 20 x 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen doubled his stories from the first week, so he wrote 40 x 2 = 80 stories.
Margot doubled her stories from the first week, so she wrote 60 x 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add the number of stories each child wrote in both weeks:
Alani: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot: 60 + 120 = 180

The total number of stories written is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the brother's age in 3 years, we need to add 3 to his current age. 

The brother's current age is twice Ann's age, and Ann is 9 years old. So, the brother's current age is 9 * 2 = 18 years.

To find the brother's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 18 + 3 = 21 years.

The brother's age in 3 years will be 21 years."
"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is 5 x 25 cents = 125 cents.
She also has 2 dimes, which is 2 x 10 cents = 20 cents.

The total amount of money Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents she will have left, we subtract 55 from 145:
145 - 55 = 90

Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Since the flag has 76 stars, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

To find the number of rows, we divide 40 by 5, which is 40 ÷ 5 = 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how many trucks are needed, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight the truck can carry.

First, calculate the total weight of the flagstones: 
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
6000 pounds ÷ 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

Final answer: 3"
"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali. So, Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's call the total number of medals given out ""x"". We can set up the equation: 10x = 39.

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 10: x = 39 ÷ 10.

x = 3.9

Since we can't have a fraction of a medal, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the question doesn't specify whether the answer should be rounded or not. 

The final answer is: 3.9"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars first. There are 8 packets, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, we need to subtract the total number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars. There are 4 adults, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16.

Now, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars among the children. There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

So, she earns 15 * $5 = $75 for the online task.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total points of the three friends, we need to calculate their points after the fourth round.

First, we know that Mike has 21 points initially. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, each player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. So, Mike and Tony get an extra point each, and Jim does not get an extra point.

Now, we add up the points of all three players to find the total points:
Mike's points: 21 + 1 = 22
Jim's points: 18
Tony's points: 42 + 1 = 43

The total points are: 22 + 18 + 43 = 83"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to determine how many oranges the sons washed.

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washed 8 oranges. 
The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He washed 4 oranges.

In total, the sons washed 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges, so the number of unwashed oranges is 15 - 12 = 3.

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the total count of each activity:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities is 220 + 90 + 60 = 370.

"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg ÷ 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

The rice will last for 3 weeks.

"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and then add the crates sold over the weekend.

Crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday: 15 + 12 + 18 = 45
Crates sold over the weekend: 20
Total crates sold: 45 + 20 = 65

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we need to subtract the total crates sold from the target to find the difference.

120 - 65 = 55

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the final cost of the desk, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carmen spent. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time. Since there were 3 other people who bid once, the bids rose 3 times. 

The first bid was $200. 
The second bid was $200 + $50 = $250.
The third bid was $250 + $50 = $300.
The fourth bid was $300 + $50 = $350.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $300, $350, and $400. 

The final bid was $400 + $50 = $450.

Carmen's total cost is $200 + $300 + $350 + $400 = $1250.

The final answer is: $1250"
"To find the total cost of driving per year, we need to calculate the total miles driven and the total cost of driving.

The distance to work and back is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles per day. Since John goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. 

Since there are 50 weeks in a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

The cost of driving is $2 per mile, so the total cost of driving is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000.

John also gets a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800.

The total cost of driving per year is $30000 + $1800 = $31800.

The final answer is: $31800"

2 x 39 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To make a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged. When you fold the paper in half, you have two sides: left and right. 

Since the left side has 16 pages (pages 1-16) and the right side has 16 pages (pages 17-32), we can calculate the total number of pieces of paper needed. Each side requires 2 pieces of paper, so we multiply the number of sides by 2.

Total pieces of paper = 2 (sides) * 2 (pieces per side) = 4

Therefore, to make a 32-page tabloid, we need 4 pieces of paper.

"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to figure out how many books she sold that year.

We know she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that she has 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year, so the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 = 110.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200.

The final answer is: $2200"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in April.

Watson works 10 hours a day and earns $10 per hour, so his daily earnings are $100. Since April has 30 days, his total earnings for the month would be $100 * 30 = $3000.

He also gets a $300 bonus for the whole month, so his total earnings for April would be $3000 + $300 = $3300.

The final answer is: $3300"

"To find the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning. Two-thirds of 60 loaves is equal to (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

Next, we subtract the morning sales from the total number of loaves to find the number of loaves left: 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, we divide the remaining loaves by 2: (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

The loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, so we divide the 10 loaves by 2: 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to divide the total weight Joey loses by the number of weeks it takes him to lose that weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much he loses per week, we can divide 8 by 4.

8 ÷ 4 = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

The answer is 4."
"To find the savings, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price, and then subtract the total cost at the discounted price.

The original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26.
The original cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $0.5 = $2.
The total original cost is $26 + $2 = $28.

The discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22.
The discounted cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $0.5 = $2.

"To find the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs the person will grow in 15 days.

Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, in 15 days, they will grow 15 / 3 = 5 extra arms.

Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, in 15 days, they will grow 15 / 5 = 3 extra legs.

The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and legs: 5 + 3 = 8.

The person will grow a total of 8 new limbs in 15 days."
"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 suits * $100 each = $600.
Next, we calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 each = $150.
Then, we find the cost of the flight ticket. It's 5 times the cost of a business suit, which is 5 * $100 = $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo's total budget is $6000, and he wants to save $2000, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left to spend on gifts.

The final answer is: $4000"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume 3 x 3 = 9 eggs per day.
Two people eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume 2 x 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Total eggs consumed per day = 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 x 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find Trent's age, we need to follow the given information:

Quinn is 30 years old. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the current population of Chile, we need to follow these steps:

First, we know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, we can find Noah's current age by adding 6 to Cera's age.

Noah's current age = Cera's current age + 6
Noah's current age = 46 + 6
Noah's current age = 52

Next, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, we can find the population of Chile six years ago by multiplying Noah's current age by 3000.

Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * Noah's current age
Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * 52
Population of Chile six years ago = 156,000

Finally, since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can find the current population by multiplying the population six years ago by 2.

Current population of Chile = Population of Chile six years ago * 2
Current population of Chile = 156,000 * 2
Current population of Chile = 312,000

The final answer is: 312,000"
"To find the number of players on the defense, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of players on the defense is 'x'. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it's x/2.

The total number of players is 105, so we can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms: 7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7: x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people with previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to follow these steps:

Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna and added them to a store that already had 50 marbles. His father also gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

First, we need to find 2/5 of 20, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, we add the marbles from the store to the marbles Solomon bought and his father gave him: 50 (in the store) + 20 (bought) + 8 (given by father) = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight: 78 * 2 = 156kgs.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth.

Volume = Length x Width x Depth
Volume = 6 ft x 4 ft x 5 ft
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill, the total cost to fill the pool would be:

Total Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
Total Cost = 120 cubic feet x $0.1 per cubic foot
Total Cost = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls and nongendered children first.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

Since there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the number of electric poles, we need to divide the total number of electric wires by 3, since the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3.

Let's do the math:

Number of electric wires = 45
Number of electric poles = 45 ÷ 3
Number of electric poles = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there were 25 men and 15 women at the party. To find the total number of people, we add the number of men and women:

Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

We also know that 22 men stayed at the party. To find the number of men who left, we subtract the number of men who stayed from the initial number of men:

Number of men who left = 25 - 22 = 3 men

Now, we know that 3 men and 10 people in total left the party. Since we know that 3 men left, the number of women who left is:

Number of women who left = 10 - 3 = 7 women

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to follow the given information:

1. The magazine costs half as much as the book.
2. The book costs $4.
3. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine.

Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, the pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 3 * 24 (assuming each box has 24 pencils) + 2 = 74.

Adding Meg's pencils, the total number of pencils is 74 + 46 = 120.

Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 24 to find the number of boxes needed.

120 ÷ 24 = 5

So, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.

Final answer: 5"
"To find out how much weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream.

Shannon's coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, it means 5 ice cubes were used (65 / 13 = 5). 

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many old records the 5 people brought in. We know that for every 2 old records, they get 1 new record. Since 5 people came in and left with 7 new records, we can start by finding out how many new records they got in total.

5 people * 1 new record/person = 5 new records

Now, we need to find out how many old records they traded for these 5 new records. Since they trade 2 old records for 1 new record, we can divide the total number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records.

5 new records ÷ 2 = 2.5 old records

Since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we'll round down to 2 old records (as the problem doesn't specify otherwise). However, we can also consider the fact that 5 people came in, and if each person got 1 new record, they would have traded 5 old records. But we know that 5 people left with 7 new records, so we need to find the correct number of old records.

Let's try another approach. If 5 people came in and left with 7 new records, and they trade 2 old records for 1 new record, we can set up an equation:

2x = 7 (where x is the number of old records)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 7 ÷ 2
x = 3.5

Again, since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we'll round down to 3 old records. However, this doesn't seem right, as 3 old records would only give 1.5 new records. Let's try another approach.

If 5 people came in and left with 7 new records, and they trade 2 old records for 1 new record, we can set up an equation:

2x = 7

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior and senior programmers.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The number of senior programmers is the remaining employees, which is 100 - 40 = 60.

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To find the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we need to consider the number of people who got on at the first and second stops. 

At the first stop, 5 people got on the bus. At the second stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. To find the total number of people who got on at the first and second stops, we add the number of people who got on at the first stop (5) and the number of people who got on at the second stop (8). 

5 + 8 = 13

Now, we need to find the total number of people heading to the third stop. We know that 20 people are heading to the third stop. Since 7 people got off at the second stop, we subtract 7 from 20 to find the number of people who got on at the first and second stops. 

20 - 7 = 13

Since 13 people got on at the first and second stops, we can conclude that 13 people got on the bus at the terminal.

The final answer is 13."
"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, let's break down the events step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops. Then, he passes 14 out to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops. After that, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops. He eats 3 more that night, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops. Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge. Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge 40% as follows:

40% ÷ 1% = 40
40 × 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes ÷ 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The correct answer is 14."
"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they received and subtract that from the total amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 and got $1 off for every $20 spent. Since they spent $80, they got 80 / 20 = 4 rewards.

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the actual rewards they got is 4 * 2 = 8 dollars.

Now, subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: 80 - 8 = 72.

The customer paid $72 on this shopping trip."
"To figure out which job Nick should take, we need to calculate how much he'll make after taxes for each job.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Annual salary: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Job B has a higher net pay of $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000.

To find the difference, we subtract Job A's net pay from Job B's net pay: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220 and then divide that number by 2.

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Half of the ruined castles are unmanned, so we divide 88 by 2:

88 / 2 = 44

There are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

Final Answer: The final answer is 44."
"To find the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment for each offer.

Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

The cost difference between the two offers is $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

"To find out how many guns they can share equally, we need to add up all the guns they have and divide by 4.

Let's add up the number of guns:
DJ has 8 guns
Nick has 10 guns
RJ has 1 gun
Richard has 5 guns

Total number of guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

Now, divide the total number of guns by 4:
24 ÷ 4 = 6

So, each of them would have 6 guns if they were to share them equally.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the amount of sugar needed for suckers and fudge separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount of sugar needed for suckers: 8 batches * 30 ounces per batch = 240 ounces.

Next, we need to calculate the amount of sugar needed for fudge: 1 batch * 70 ounces per batch = 70 ounces.

Now, let's add the amounts together: 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the value of each share after the price increase and decrease.

First, we calculate the increase in the first year. The stock price increases by 50%, which means it becomes 150% of its original price. To find 150% of $8, we multiply $8 by 1.5.

$8 * 1.5 = $12

So, the value of each share after the first year is $12.

Next, we calculate the decrease in the second year. The stock price decreases by 25%, which means it becomes 75% of its value after the first year. To find 75% of $12, we multiply $12 by 0.75.

$12 * 0.75 = $9

Now, we multiply the value of each share after the second year by the number of shares Maria bought.

8 shares * $9 per share = $72

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. We know Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs. John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the amount Luke ate from the amount John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the number of students in the smallest group, we need to divide the total number of students (200) by 3, since there are three groups. 

Let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. Since the other two groups are equal in number, each of them has 2x students. We can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 2x = 200

Combine like terms:

5x = 200

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 40

So, the smallest group has 40 students."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to know the number of cows and chickens. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can say the number of chickens is 2 times the number of cows. Let's use 'c' for the number of cows. The number of chickens will be 2c.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

c + 2c = 60

Combine like terms:

3c = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

c = 20

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens: 2c = 2(20) = 40 chickens.

Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 x 4 = 80 legs.
Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 x 2 = 80 legs.

The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find out how many balls Josh has, we need to calculate the number of balls he had at the end of the fourth week.

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. 

Week 1: 3 balls
Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

Since Josh dropped 3 balls, but 2 were caught, he lost 1 ball. So, he has 6 - 1 = 5 balls left.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we need to add the weights of the animals and the container.

The pink frog weighs 50 pounds, the blue beetle weighs 50 pounds, the green toad weighs 50 pounds, the yellow snake weighs 60 pounds, and the container weighs 20 pounds.

First, we add the weights of the animals: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 = 210 pounds.

Then, we add the weight of the container: 210 + 20 = 230 pounds.

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 230 pounds.

"To find the total distance covered in June, we need to calculate the distance covered each day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Tyson originally runs 5000 meters per day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters, which is 5000 * 1/5 = 1000 meters. So, he will now run 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters per day.

There are 30 days in June. Therefore, the total distance covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180,000"
"To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to first find the price of Juice Box B and Juice Box C.

Since Juice Box A is 4 dollars and Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, Juice Box B is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.

Since Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, Juice Box C is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs from the tables with 4 legs and the tables with 3 legs separately.

First, let's calculate the number of legs from the tables with 4 legs: 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs.

Next, let's calculate the number of legs from the tables with 3 legs: 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs.

Now, we add the number of legs from both types of tables: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs.

The total number of legs in the restaurant is 310."
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is:
4 cookies/day * 5 days = 20 cookies

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is:
1 cookie/day * 7 days = 7 cookies

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is:
20 cookies + 7 cookies = 27 cookies

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is:
36 cookies - 27 cookies = 9 cookies

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, we need to calculate the discount on one shirt and then multiply it by 2.

First, find 40% of $30:

40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, subtract the discount from the original price of one shirt:

$30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, multiply the discounted price by 2:

$18 * 2 = $36

The final answer is $36."
"To find the difference in daily revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from tractors and silos separately.

Revenue from tractors: 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day
Revenue from silos: 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

Total revenue: $1000 + $1100 = $2100/day

Now, let's find the difference in daily revenue: $1100 - $1000 = $100

To find the percentage increase, we'll divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100:
($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, they are making 10% more per day now.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total yearly cost of dog expenses, we need to calculate the monthly cost and multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the monthly cost of food. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly cost of food by 4:

$25 per week * 4 weeks = $100 per month

Next, we add the monthly cost of treats and medicine:

$100 per month (food) + $20 per month (treats) + $100 per month (medicine) = $220 per month

Now, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 to get the yearly cost:

$220 per month * 12 months = $2,640 per year

The final answer is: $2640"
"To find the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to add up the time for each activity.

Monday's yoga class is 1 hour long. 
Tuesday's cooking class is 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so it's 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is half an hour, which is 0.5 hours.
Thursday's museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so it's 1.5 hours.
Friday's errands are 2 hours long.

Now, let's add up the hours:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours

The total hours of Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To find out how many plant pots April needs in total, we need to calculate the number of pots for the roses. Since she needs twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 pots for the roses.

In total, April needs 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

Since she already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of pots she needs from the number she already had: 100 - 90 = 10.

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

Let's break it down step by step:

Andrea had $36 initially.
She spent $11 on a sweater.
She gave her brother $4.

First, we add the amount she spent and gave away: $11 + $4 = $15

Now, we subtract this total from the initial amount: $36 - $15 = $21

So, Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to add up the time spent on each activity. 

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. He also watched 3 different shows that were 2 hours each, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 hours. 

The total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time: 0.3x = 15. Solving for x, we get x = 15 / 0.3 = 50.

This means John spent 50 hours on vacation.

To find the time spent sightseeing, we can calculate 40% of the total time: 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add it to her initial savings.

Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job and worked for 20 hours. So, her earnings from the first job are 20 * $10 = $200.

At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and worked for 15 hours. So, her earnings from the second job are 15 * $5 = $75.

Now, let's add her initial savings: $200 + $75 = $275.

Annabelle still needs to save $400 - $275 = $125.

The final answer is $125."
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the height of the second tree. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

The combined height of the two shortest trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shortest trees, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the items is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he has $28 - $17 = $11.
His mother then gives him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is $21."
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5. Since she wants to play once, the total cost for mini-golf is $5. The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride. She wants to ride the go-karts twice, so the total cost for go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20. 

The total cost of the activities is $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) = $25. Now, let's subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 (budget) - $25 (total cost) = $65.

Since each friend will also get $5 in arcade tokens, we need to subtract that from the remaining budget as well: $65 - $5 = $60.

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend (including the arcade tokens): $60 ÷ $5 = 12.

So, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract it from her daily pocket money.

Daily pocket money: $5
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4
Cost of each lollipop: $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days: $1 * 5 = $5

Since Marisa saves the change, we need to subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

So, Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days.

Final answer: $0"
"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to follow the steps below:

First, we know that Billy spent $2 on gumballs. Since he took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, he must have had $2 left as change. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 initially.

Next, we know that Billy spent $8 on gumballs, so he must have spent $10 - $8 = $2 on candy.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide the amount spent on candy ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5) to find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought: $2 ÷ $1.5 = 1.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 1.33 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.33}$"
"To find Carver's son's age, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Carver's son is x years old. Since Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age, we can write the equation:

2x - 5 = 45

To solve for x, we need to add 5 to both sides of the equation:

2x = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 50 ÷ 2
x = 25

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is 25."
"To find the total distance traveled by the train in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance).

The total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval:

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days

To convert 0.0375 days to hours, we multiply by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):

0.0375 days * 24 hours/day = 0.9 hours

To convert 0.9 hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

0.9 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 54 minutes

The train goes between services for approximately 54 minutes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how much stuffing Mark needs, we need to calculate the amount of stuffing for each type of dog bed.

A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. To find the amount of stuffing for a collie bed, we need to find the average of the two. 

The average of 8 and 2 is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

So, a collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

To make 4 chihuahua beds, Mark needs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.

To make 3 collie beds, Mark needs 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles and the speed is 70 miles per hour. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Time = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours

Next, we need to add the time taken for the detour. The detour is 10 miles and the speed is still 70 miles per hour. We can use the same formula:

Time = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.14 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken to drive back home. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 miles per hour. Again, we use the same formula:

Time = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Finally, we add the times together to get the total time taken:

Total time taken = 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours + 3 hours = 5.99 hours

The final answer is: 5.99"
"To find the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.

Total students = 96
Absent students = 5 girls + 4 boys = 9

Number of boys present = Total students - Absent students
= 96 - 9
= 87

So, there were 87 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday."
"To find the number of boys, we need to divide the number of girls by 2, since there are twice as many boys as girls.

Number of boys = Number of girls / 2
Number of boys = 6 / 2
Number of boys = 3

Now, we add the number of boys and girls to find the total number of kids in the park.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 3 + 6
Total number of kids = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the minimum number of points Jane needs on the third test, we need to subtract the points she's already scored from the total required points.

Total required points: 42
Points scored so far: 15 + 18 = 33

Points needed on the third test: 42 - 33 = 9

So, Jane needs at least 9 points on the third test to pass."
"To find out how many people were kicked out for other reasons, we need to subtract the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total number of people kicked out.

Let's start by finding out how many people were kicked out for shoplifting. Since 4 times the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5 equals the number of people kicked out for shoplifting, we can write an equation:

4 * 3 - 5 = 7

This means 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.

Next, we know that 3 times the number of people kicked out for shoplifting equals the number of people kicked out for physical violence. So, we can write another equation:

3 * 7 = 21

This means 21 people were kicked out for physical violence.

Now, we can add up the number of people kicked out for each reason:

3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31

Since the total number of people kicked out is 50, we can subtract 31 from 50 to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons:

50 - 31 = 19

Therefore, 19 people were kicked out for other reasons.

Final answer: 19"
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to figure out how many points Sara had first. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Sara had x points before. Then, Erin had 3x points.

We know that Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 14

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 14 ÷ 3
x = 4.67

So, Sara had approximately 4.67 points before. 

Now, to find out how many points Erin had before, we can multiply Sara's points by 3:

Erin's points before = 3 * 4.67
Erin's points before = 14

However, this doesn't make sense, as Erin scored 14 points after scoring 14 points. This means Erin must have had 0 points before scoring 14 points.

The correct answer is 0."
"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break it down into parts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and we need to add 20% of that cost for the logo. 20% of $20 is $4, so each frame costs $20 + $4 = $24. We have 44 frames, so the total cost for the frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

Next, we need to add the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. So, the total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11. Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the frames, pins, and cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of the original cost and subtract it from the original cost.

The original cost is $400. To find 20% of this, we multiply $400 by 0.20.

$400 * 0.20 = $80

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost.

$400 - $80 = $320

The total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

The store sold 14 pairs of shoes on Friday. Then, they sold double that number on Saturday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, 6 people returned their shoes, so we need to subtract those from the total.

Total number of shoes sold = 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returned) = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total hours of dance practice per week, we need to add the hours for each day.

Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class. So, Saturday's practice is 2 x 1 = 2 hours.

Total hours per week = 1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Let's say the total number of pieces is x. Since 40% of the equipment were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The number of functioning pieces is x - 0.4x = 0.6x.

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is the total amount spent on all pieces minus the amount spent on faulty pieces. The total amount spent on all pieces is $400,000.

The amount spent on faulty pieces is 0.4x.

So, the amount spent on functioning pieces is 400,000 - 0.4x.

We can set up an equation to solve for x:

0.6x = 400,000 - 0.4x

Combine like terms:

0.6x + 0.4x = 400,000

1x = 400,000

x = 400,000

Now that we know the total number of pieces is 400,000, we can find the number of functioning pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = 0.6x
= 0.6 * 400,000
= 240,000

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 400,000 - 0.4 * 400,000
= 400,000 - 160,000
= 240,000

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep.

Half of the sheep is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

She gets 1 kg of milk from 15 sheep, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

She gets 2 kg of milk from the other 15 sheep, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

The total amount of milk Mary collects every day is 15 + 30 = 45 kg.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the number of rolls Mrs. Sherman had left after feeding her children, we need to subtract 6 from 12.

12 - 6 = 6

Then, we multiply the remaining 6 rolls by 8 to find the total number of pieces.

6 * 8 = 48

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

Final answer: 48"
"To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils in total, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 pupils who like blue.

Now, we need to find out how many pupils are left after removing those who like blue. That would be 40 - 20 = 20 pupils.

Next, we're told that one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils who like green.

To find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils. So, 20 - 5 = 15 pupils like yellow.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow."
"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to figure out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday and Wednesday.

Since Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday and she got $56, we can divide $56 by $4 to find out how many apples she picked on Monday.

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

Since Lucy picked double the number of apples on Wednesday compared to Tuesday, and she picked 12 apples on Tuesday, she picked 12 * 2 = 24 apples on Wednesday.

Now, we can add the number of apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday to find the total number of apples picked.

14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

The total number of apples picked is 50."
"To find the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we need to subtract the total number of socks she washed from the total number of socks.

She washed 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair has 2 socks, she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

She also washed 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

The correct answer is 15."
"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies she initially had, the number of cookies Janet gave her, and the number of cookies her brother ate.

Let's do the math:

Cookies initially had: 23
Cookies from Janet: + 42
Total cookies: 23 + 42 = 65

Now, let's subtract the cookies eaten by her brother: 65 - 44 = 21

So, Rachel has 21 cookies left.

Final answer: 21"
"To find out how much Karan has to pay each month, we need to calculate the interest first. The interest is 10% of the total amount borrowed, which is $3,650. 

Interest = 10% of $3,650
Interest = 0.10 * $3,650
Interest = $365

Now, we add the interest to the total amount borrowed to get the total amount Karan has to pay:
Total amount = $3,650 + $365
Total amount = $4,015

Since Karan has to pay for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5 to find the monthly payment:
Monthly payment = $4,015 / 5
Monthly payment = $802

The final answer is: $802"
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 14 km/h x 8 h
Distance = 112 km

Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour and stopped after 5 hours. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 9 km/h x 5 h
Distance = 45 km

Now, we need to find the difference between the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:

Difference = Distance hiked by Cho - Distance hiked by Chloe
Difference = 112 km - 45 km
Difference = 67 km

The final answer is: 67"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to add the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we need to multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher. Since she buys enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups, the total number of cups is 3 * 12 = 36 cups.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Her total cost is $18, which she spent on supplies.

Her profit is her revenue minus her cost: $36 - $18 = $18.

To find her profit per hour, we need to divide her total profit by the number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups, she needs 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Her profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to figure out what number, when multiplied by 3/5, gives us 12.8 hectares. We can set up an equation: (3/5)x = 12.8. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/3.

x = 12.8 * (5/3)
x = 21.33

So, Mr. Ruther had approximately 21.33 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is 21.33."
"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26. Since the choir is performing with just the female members, there are 26 girls.

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find half of the total number of people performing. The total number of people performing is the number of girls (26) plus the 3 teachers, which is 26 + 3 = 29. Half of 29 is 29 / 2 = 14.5. Since we can't have half a person, we'll round down to 14.

So, the total number of people performing is 26 (girls) + 3 (teachers) - 14 (half of the performers) = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3 to find the number of messages to Mr. Yu.

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
= 66 / 3
= 22

Total number of messages = 66 + 22
= 88

The final answer is 88."
"To find out how much David saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 9 ride tickets to the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the parts in the ratio (5 + 6 = 11).

Let's divide 165 by 11: 
165 ÷ 11 = 15

Since the ratio is 5:6, we multiply 15 by 6 to find the number of popsicles Sam has:
Sam: 15 * 6 = 90

Now, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is 15."
"To calculate how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to find the difference between the cost of the cable package and the cost of the streaming services.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling. 20% of $10 is $2, so the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.

To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42

So, Tim saves $42 per month by cancelling his cable package.

The final answer is: $42"
"To find the total work time, we need to add up the time spent on each activity. 

First, let's convert the time spent recording from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 90 minutes is equal to 1.5 hours.

Time spent writing = 4 hours
Time spent recording = 1.5 hours
Time spent editing = 1.5 hours

Total time = 4 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 7 hours

Now, we can find the percentage of time spent editing:

(1.5 hours / 7 hours) * 100 = 21.43%

So, Carol spent approximately 21.43% of her total work time editing.

The final answer is 21.43%."
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we need to calculate double the capacity of the shelving system and then add 20 more books.

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total capacity is 6 x 6 = 36 books.

To find double the capacity, we multiply 36 by 2: 2 x 36 = 72 books.

Then, we add 20 more books to that: 72 + 20 = 92 books.

The final answer is 92."
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she received, and the number of cards she gave away.

Erica initially made 20 cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, she initially had 20 + 2 * 15 = 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards given away.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has: 
Initial cards: 50
Cards received: 17

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is 1/3 * 12 = 4 slices.
Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is 1/4 * 12 = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny had 12 slices initially and gave away 7 slices, so she has 12 - 7 = 5 slices left.

Jenny also ate 2 slices, so she has 5 - 2 = 3 slices left.

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save, we need to subtract the cost of the bike from the amount of money he has.

Mark has $50 and wants to buy a bike that costs $300. 

$50 - $300 = -$250 (this means Mark doesn't have enough money)

Since Mark doesn't have enough money, he needs to earn more money to buy the bike. 

Let's calculate how many days it will take for Mark to earn the remaining amount:

$300 (cost of the bike) - $50 (initial amount) = $250 (remaining amount)

Mark earns $10 per day. 

$250 / $10 = 25 days

So, Mark needs 25 days to earn the remaining amount and buy the bike.

Final answer: 25"

"To find the energy saved, we need to first find the energy used in 8 hours a day and then subtract the energy used in 3 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy each hour. So, in 8 hours, it uses 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh).

Now, let's find the energy used in 3 hours a day: 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh.

The energy saved per day is 7200 Wh - 2700 Wh = 4500 Wh.

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 Wh, we can convert the energy saved per day to kilowatts:

Energy saved per day = 4500 Wh / 1000 = 4.5 kWh.

Now, let's find the energy saved in 30 days: 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need:

- 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

- 5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
- 5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00."
"To find the number of corns, we know that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he must have 40 - 40 = 0 corns initially. Then, he bought 60 more cannolis, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis. 

Now, we know that there are twice as many corns as cannolis. So, the number of corns is 2 * 100 = 200.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is 200 + 100 = 300.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. So, the total amount paid in May is:
40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left. 
1/4 of 40 is 10 employees. 
So, the company had 40 - 10 = 30 employees in June.

The total amount paid in June is:
30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

The total amount paid in the two months is:

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks and add the cost of the finale firework.

The first package costs $400.
The second package costs twice as much, so it costs 2 x $400 = $800.
The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 x $1200 = $240.
The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to calculate the discount amount and then multiply it by the number of blouses.

The discount is 30% of the regular price of $20. To find 30% of $20, we multiply $20 by 0.3.

Discount = $20 * 0.3
Discount = $6

The discounted price of each blouse is the regular price minus the discount amount.

Discounted price = $20 - $6
Discounted price = $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 60 + 15 + 45 = 150. Since the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350.

However, we need to find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees. Let's denote the number of apples gathered from the average trees as x. Since Joanne gathers x apples from the average trees, her sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the average trees is 350, and since Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees, Joanne also gathers 350 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is 350."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of dromedaries in the herd. We know that camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump. Let's use the information given to set up two equations.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, and each animal has one head. So, we can write an equation: c + d = 180, where c is the number of camels and d is the number of dromedaries.

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have 2 bumps and dromedaries have 1 bump, we can write another equation: 2c + d = 304.

Now, we can solve these two equations. We can subtract the second equation from the first equation to get: c = 180 - d. Then, we can substitute this expression for c into the first equation: (180 - d) + d = 180. This simplifies to 180 = 180, which doesn't help us find the value of d. So, we need to try another approach.

Let's try to isolate d in the first equation: c = 180 - d. We can rewrite this as d = 180 - c. Now, we can substitute this expression for d into the second equation: 2c + (180 - c) = 304. This simplifies to c + 180 = 304, and then c = 124.

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting c into one of the original equations: d = 180 - c. This gives us d = 180 - 124, which simplifies to d = 56.

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

The final answer is: 56"

Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day for the first 4 days. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Then, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 km is:
0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

So, the total distance traveled in the first 6 days is:
800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we add the distances traveled in the first 6 days and the second week:
1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers."
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Peter's locker size by 4 to get Zack's locker size.

Peter's locker size = 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches

Since Timothy's locker is half as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2 to get Timothy's locker size.

Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the distance Oliver must climb, we need to find the difference in elevation between Stanley's comb and Oliver's current elevation.

Stanley's comb is at 10,000 feet, and Oliver is at 3,000 feet. 

10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 feet

Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial amount he had to the amount he received from the two banks.

He initially had $5000. The first bank gave him $4000, and the second bank gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

Let's add the initial capital to the total amount received:
$5000 + $4000 = $9000
$9000 + $8000 = $17000

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

First, 4 boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

The remaining cats on the rock are 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

Then, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

So, 18 cats ran after the mouse, leaving 30 - 18 = 12 cats on the rock.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first 6 months: 6 months * $8/month = $48. This is the cost for the introductory period.

Next, we have the normal rate of $12 per month for 8 months. So, the cost for this period is 8 months * $12/month = $96.

Lastly, the price increased to $14 per month for the remaining 8 months. The cost for this period is 8 months * $14/month = $112.

Now, let's add up the costs: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256.

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $256."
"To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we need to first find the original price of each pair of jeans.

Let's say the original price of the jogger jeans is x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

We know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved 1/3 * x from the jogger jeans and 2/3 * (x + 6) from the tattered jeans.

The total savings is $6, so we can set up the equation:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * (x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

(1/3)x + (2/3)x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

(1 + 2/3)x + 4 = 6

To add 1 and 2/3, we need a common denominator, which is 3. So we can rewrite 1 as 3/3:

(3/3)x + (2/3)x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

(3/3)x + (2/3)x = (3/3)x + (2/3)x
(5/3)x + 4 = 6

Subtract 4 from both sides:

(5/3)x = 2

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

5x = 6

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6/5

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $6/5, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

Original price of tattered jeans = x + 6
= 6/5 + 6

To add 6/5 and 6, we need a common denominator, which is 5. So we can rewrite 6 as 30/5:

Original price of tattered jeans = 6/5 + 30/5
= 36/5

Now we can find the difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans:

Difference = Original price of tattered jeans - Original price of jogger jeans
= 36/5 - 6/5
= 30/5
= 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each vehicle and add them together.

There are 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each. So, the total capacity of the buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.

There are 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each. So, the total capacity of the minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.

There are 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each. So, the total capacity of the minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and Lillian buys 3 of them. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 x 20 = 60.

The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. She builds 3 of these feeders, so the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 x 30 = 90.

Now, we add the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

Final answer: 150"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25, which is $1. 

The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to figure out how much money he made from selling the cards.

Since he has $50 in spending cash and he keeps 1/3 of the cards, he must have made $50 from selling the cards. 

Let's say he started with x cards. He sells x - 1/3 cards. Since he sells each card for $1.5, the amount of money he made from selling the cards is 1.5(x - 1/3).

We know that the amount of money he made from selling the cards is $50. So we can set up the equation:

1.5(x - 1/3) = 50

To solve for x, we need to first simplify the equation:

1.5x - 0.5 = 50

Now, add 0.5 to both sides:

1.5x = 50.5

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 50.5 / 1.5
x = 33.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we round down to the nearest whole number.

x = 33

So, Kenny started with 33 cards."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many hotdogs the caterer prepared in total. Since half of the guests were prepared for two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

36 guests / 2 = 18 hotdogs for the guests who got two hotdogs
18 guests / 2 = 9 hotdogs for the guests who got one hotdog

Since 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog, the caterer had enough hotdogs for 40 guests to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer had a total of:

18 hotdogs for the guests who got two hotdogs + 40 hotdogs for the guests who got two hotdogs = 58 hotdogs

Now, we know the caterer had 58 hotdogs in total. We also know that 18 guests got two hotdogs, so the remaining guests got one hotdog. To find out how many guests got one hotdog, we can subtract the number of guests who got two hotdogs from the total number of guests:

40 guests - 18 guests = 22 guests

So, 22 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Half of 6 is 3. 
Since her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, we add 4 to 3. 
3 + 4 = 7

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7). 
6 + 7 = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's add up the cost of the items:
$120 (pot and pans) + $20 (mixing bowls) + $25 (utensils) = $165

Next, we need to find 20% of $165. To do this, we multiply $165 by 0.20:
$165 * 0.20 = $33

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165 - $33 = $132

So, Charlotte's order will cost $132 after the 20% discount.

The final answer is: $132"
"To find out how much money Dora needs, we need to add the cost of the items she wants to buy: 
$6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost:
$19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the steps below:

First, we know that Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Then, Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, which is 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons. 

Next, Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Finally, Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons.

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can multiply 15 gallons by 8 pints/gallon to get the total number of pints.

15 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 120 pints

Then, we need to find 1/4 of 120 pints.

1/4 of 120 pints = 120 * 1/4 = 30 pints

Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to calculate how much money he spent on chips and candy bars. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents, and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 x 40 = 120 cents.

George spent $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. Since he had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of his money, which is 500 - (500 x 1%) = 500 - 5 = 495 cents.

Now, we subtract the cost of chips from the total amount he spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars: 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many he bought: 375 ÷ 75 = 5.

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

Total lollipops = 25
Lollipops kept by Ray = 5
Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5 = 20

Since the remaining lollipops were shared equally among 4 friends, we divide the remaining lollipops by 4.

Lollipops per friend = 20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The correct answer is: 5"
"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom had from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people who had a piece = 2

Since they each had a piece, we can divide the number of people by 2 to find the number of pieces they had: 2 people * 1 piece/person = 2 pieces

Weight of the pieces = 2 pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 2 = 18 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 18 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to add Sitti's and Juris's oranges together and then divide by the total number of people, including themselves and their 6 friends.

First, let's add Sitti's and Juris's oranges: 34 + 22 = 56

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people. There are 8 people in total (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends).

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

The cost of the onions: 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of the beef stock: 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00
The total cost of the ingredients: $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00

Antoine's soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00

The cost per serving is $2.00."
"To figure out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we need to calculate the time it takes for her to get to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 x 4 = 16 minutes.

If Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

So, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne.

Final answer: $\boxed{21}$"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width. We know the area is 360 square feet, so we can set up the equation:

360 = 9 * Width

To find the width, we can divide both sides by 9:

Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of the room is 98 feet."
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads (1 * 20 = 20) and 2 packs of clear beads (2 * 20 = 40). So, Elizabeth has 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80). So, Margareth has 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 140 - 60 = 80.

"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature change due to baking and then subtract the cooling effect.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to baking:
Temperature change = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees

Next, let's calculate the cooling effect:
Cooling rate = 2 degrees/10 minutes = 0.2 degrees/minute
Cooling time = 30 minutes
Temperature change due to cooling = 0.2 degrees/minute * 30 minutes = 6 degrees

Now, let's calculate the final temperature:
Initial temperature = 40 degrees
Temperature after baking = 40 + 15 = 55 degrees
Temperature after cooling = 55 - 6 = 49 degrees

The final temperature is 49 degrees."
"To find James' time for the swim, we need to calculate 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time.

10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, so James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

For the bike ride, James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon. Jon's bike time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. 
James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

For the run, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. Since Jon's run time is 50 minutes, James' run time must be 50 + 10 = 60 minutes.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to break down the information given. 

First, we know that Movie C is 1.25 hours long. We convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C to find the length of Movie B.

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Now, we know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

80 minutes ÷ 4 = 20 minutes

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

Michael's horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. We need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

Time = 30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours

Distance = speed * time
Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay eaten is:
16 miles * 1/2 bail per mile = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:
8 bails * $3 per bail = $24

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30

Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. He sold 17 of them for $20 each and the rest for $25 each. 

First, let's find out how many sneakers were sold for $25 each. 
Number of sneakers sold for $25 = Total sneakers - Sneakers sold for $20
= 48 - 17
= 31

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 and 31 sneakers at $25.
Revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 = 17 * $20
= $340

Revenue from selling 31 sneakers at $25 = 31 * $25
= $775

Total revenue = Revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 + Revenue from selling 31 sneakers at $25

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to add up the weight of each item.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, which weigh 2 pounds each. He buys 4 bags of carrots, which weigh 12 pounds each. He also buys 42 bales of hay, which weigh 75 pounds each, and 20 sacks of oats, which weigh 65 pounds each.

Total weight of feed = 2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 42 * 75 (hay) + 20 * 65 (oats)
= 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300
= 4400 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips.

Number of trips = Total weight / Capacity of the truck
= 4400 / 2250
= 1.96

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling, we need to calculate her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Total earnings per week is 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, her total earnings in a month is 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is 84."
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow the information given in the problem. 

First, we know that Frederick has 10 plants. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. To find out how many plants Toni has, we can calculate 60% of Frederick's plants and add it to Frederick's plants.

60% of 10 = 0.6 * 10 = 6

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + 6
= 10 + 6
= 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni.

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
= 16 - 7
= 9

The final answer is 9."

"To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples they bought and subtract the discount.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.45 = $9.
Becky received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.50 = $10.
Kelly received a 10 percent discount, which is 10% of 10 = 0.10 x 10 = $1.
Kelly paid 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total.

First, we calculate the total number of pencils initially: 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

Next, we calculate the number of pencils used in 2 months: 1/5 of 300 pencils = (1/5) * 300 = 60 pencils.

Then, we subtract the pencils used from the total: 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

Finally, we calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year: 1/3 of 240 pencils = (1/3) * 240 = 80 pencils.

The number of pencils left is 80."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x. Since he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, and he gets 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room, we can write the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we'll subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we need to divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. To do this, we divide the combined length of the remoras (1 foot) by the length of the shark (10 feet) and multiply by 100.

(1 / 10) * 100 = 10%

So, the remoras occupy 10% of the shark's body length.

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts from the total number of kids in the class.

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts: 9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) = 15

However, we need to subtract the kids who are allergic to both, since they were counted twice: 15 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class: 32 - 12 = 20

So, 20 kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to multiply the number of groups by the number of employees in each group.

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day and then multiply it by 5 (the number of days).

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds his horses twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find out how many bags of oats he needs for 5 days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total amount of oats needed by 50 to find out how many bags: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats for his horses for five days.

Final answer: 4"

The child will take 4 days to save the remaining amount and buy the toy."
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to subtract the total capacity of the trays from the total number of eggs.

Jaime has 64 eggs and 2 trays that can hold 24 eggs each. We can calculate the total capacity of the trays by multiplying the number of trays by the capacity of each tray.

Total capacity = 2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs

Now, we subtract the total capacity from the total number of eggs to find out how many eggs won't be placed.

Number of eggs that won't be placed = Total number of eggs - Total capacity

"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each layer and add them together.

The bottom layer has 4 girls, and the average height of these girls is 64 inches. So, the total height of the bottom layer is 4 * 64 = 256 inches.

The next layer has 3 girls standing on top of the 4, and the average height of these girls is also 64 inches. So, the total height of this layer is 3 * 64 = 192 inches.

The next layer has 2 girls standing on top of the 3, and the average height of these girls is also 64 inches. So, the total height of this layer is 2 * 64 = 128 inches.

The shortest girl is 60 inches tall, and she is at the top of the pyramid.

Now, let's add up the heights of all the layers: 
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 576 inches

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
576 ÷ 12 = 48 feet

"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of guests is x.

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost).

The cost of the second venue is $25x (per guest charge).

Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

10"
"To solve this problem, we need to use variables to represent the number of insects each person found.

Let's say Bodhi found x insects.

Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects.

Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, 5 days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 x 5 = 10.

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20. Therefore, the total cost of 10 bus trips is 10 x $2.20 = $22.

If Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total number of animals in the farm and zoo, we need to calculate the number of cows and sheep in each place and then add them together.

The farm has 30 cows. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so it has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so it has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of animals by adding the number of cows and sheep from both places. 
Total animals = 30 (cows from the farm) + 60 (cows from the zoo) + 10 (sheep from the farm) + 20 (sheep from the zoo) = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"

"To calculate the calorie deficit needed for Andy to lose 30 pounds, we need to find out how many days he has to lose the weight. 

From December 31st to July 19th, there are 183 days. 

Now, we need to calculate the total calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to burn 30 x 3500 = 105,000 calories to lose 30 pounds.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed to burn by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 183 days ≈ 576 calories per day.

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 576 calories to reach his goal."

"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes. 20% of $500 is 0.20 * 500 = $100. So, she spent $100 on clothes.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs. 25% of $400 is 0.25 * 400 = $100. So, she spent $100 on CDs.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount: $400 - $100 = $300.

So, Julie had $300 left.

300"
"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4. 

The total cost is $120,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can set up the equation:

House cost + Lot cost = Total cost
3x + x = 120,000
4x = 120,000

Now, divide both sides by 4:
x = 120,000 / 4
x = 30,000

So, the house cost $30,000."
"To find the profit, we need to subtract the total cost from the total revenue. 

First, let's find the total cost. Since Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to figure out how many cookies Josh made first. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Since Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her original weekly consumption and the new weekly consumption.

Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. To find her weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. So, her original weekly consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour. To find her original weekly bill, we multiply the weekly consumption by the cost per kilowatt-hour. So, her original weekly bill is 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126.

The new device will consume 2 kilowatts per hour. To find her new daily consumption, we add the new device's consumption to her original daily consumption. So, her new daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour.

To find her new weekly consumption, we multiply the new daily consumption by 7. So, her new weekly consumption is 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours.

To find her new weekly bill, we multiply the new weekly consumption by the cost per kilowatt-hour. So, her new weekly bill is 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many hours it takes for one person to paint a whole house. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can multiply the time it takes to paint half a house by 2 to find the time it takes to paint a whole house.

Time to paint half a house = 5 days
Time to paint a whole house = 2 * 5 days = 10 days

Now, we need to find out how many hours it takes for one person to paint a whole house. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

Time to paint a whole house = 10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

Since 5 people can paint a whole house in the same amount of time it takes one person to paint a whole house, it will take 5 people 240 hours to paint a whole house.

Final answer: 240"
"To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we need to figure out how many chairs Ophelia has. We know that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Since she has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs: 

Let's say the number of chairs Ophelia has is x. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can write the equation as:

20 = x - 2

To solve for x, we add 2 to both sides of the equation:

x = 20 + 2
x = 22

So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna:

Total = 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs)
Total = 108

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. To find out how many people are left, we subtract 8 from 48.

48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus. So, we multiply 8 by 5.

5 * 8 = 40

Now, we add the number of people who got on (40) to the number of people left after the first stop (40).

40 + 40 = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. To find out how many people are left, we subtract 21 from 80.

80 - 21 = 59

Finally, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which means 3 times the number who got off (21). So, we multiply 21 by 3.

3 * 21 = 63

Now, we add the number of people who got on (63) to the number of people left after the second stop (59).

59 + 63 = 122

The final answer is 122."
"To find the age difference between James and his cousin, we need to calculate their ages in 8 years and then subtract James' age from his cousin's age.

James will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.

In 8 years, James' age will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.

James' cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James' age in 8 years. Twice James' age in 8 years is 2 x 30 = 60 years. So, his cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.

Now, let's find James' cousin's current age by subtracting 8 years from his age in 8 years: 55 - 8 = 47 years.

The age difference between James and his cousin is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

Since the total cost of all three items is $2,400, the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2: $600 ÷ 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we need to first find the total number of seashells brought by the girls. 

Since the boys brought 60 shells each and there are 20 kids in total, the number of boys is half of 20, which is 10. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 
So, the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

Now, we need to divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls. 
There are 10 girls, so each girl brought 300 / 10 = 30 seashells.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know that George had 3 candies left after eating 5, so we can find out how many candies he had initially by adding 5 to 3. 

3 + 5 = 8

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can multiply the number of candies George had by 2 to find the number of candies Nick had. 

8 * 2 = 16

So, Nick had 16 candies initially.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we need to follow the given information:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we know Alyana is 6 years old. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we can calculate Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."

"To find out how much Elvis has to save each day in the second half of the month, we need to divide the total savings for the second half by the number of days in that half.

Elvis saves twice as much in the second half as he does in the first half. Let's say he saves x dollars in the first half. Then, he saves 2x dollars in the second half.

We know that the total savings for the month is $1125. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 1125

Combine like terms:

3x = 1125

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 375

Now that we know Elvis saves $375 in the first half, we can find out how much he saves in the second half. Since the second half is twice as much, he saves 2x = 2 * 375 = $750.

There are 15 days in the second half of the month. To find out how much Elvis has to save each day, we divide the total savings for the second half by 15:

$750 ÷ 15 = $50

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 per day in the second half of the month.

"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

First, let's add up the cost of all the items: 
5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 x $0.25 = $0.50
1 calculator at $12 is $12
1 geometry set at $10 is $10

Now, let's add up the total cost: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20

To apply the 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $20. 10% is the same as 0.1, so we multiply $20 by 0.1: 0.1 x $20 = $2

First, let's calculate the commission for sales up to $1000. This is 30% of $1000. To find 30% of $1000, we multiply 0.3 by $1000.

0.3 * $1000 = $300

Next, we need to calculate the additional commission for sales over $1000. This is 10% of $1500 (since $2500 - $1000 = $1500). To find 10% of $1500, we multiply 0.1 by $1500.

0.1 * $1500 = $150

Now, we add the two commissions together to find Antonella's total earnings.

$300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"To figure out how many water bottles Bill needs, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has and the total number of bottles he needs.

Bill has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so he has 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

Since Bill wants 2 bottles of water for each guest, and he has 70 guests, he will need 70 x 2 = 140 bottles.

To find out how many more bottles he needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day, we need to calculate the time it takes him to swim 3 miles in both conditions.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes him to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3:
3 × 16 = 48 minutes

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. So, we first find the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day:
2 × 16 = 32
32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3:
3 × 34 = 102 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a cold day from the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day:
102 - 48 = 54 minutes

The time difference is 54 minutes."
"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings.

Weekly earnings: $2/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, let's divide the amount he wants to save ($80) by his weekly earnings ($40):

$80 ÷ $40 = 2 weeks

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

Final answer: 2"
"To find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we need to multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3.

The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is 3 times the cost of the foot-long fish sub. So, we multiply $40 by 3.

$40 * 3 = $120

The total cost for both subs is $40 + $120 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of holes in the buttons, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 x 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons with four holes. The total number of holes in these buttons is 14 x 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons: 14 + 56 = 70.

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70."
"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can divide Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size: 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size: 24 ÷ 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find the size of Peter's locker, we can divide Zack's locker size by 4.

Peter's locker size: 12 ÷ 4 = 3 cubic inches

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many cups Juan drinks, we need to multiply the amount Octavia drinks by 10. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, she drinks 0.5 cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 0.5 * 10 = 5 cups.

The doctor has asked Juan to reduce his intake to 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract 4 from 5.

5 - 4 = 1

Juan needs to reduce his daily coffee intake by 1 cup.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 x 10 = 30.

There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 x 5 = 15.

The total number of rodents is 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45.

The pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we need to add their weights and divide by 3.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the 3 friends is 180 pounds."
"To find the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to calculate the total angle the sun has moved upward.

The sun moves 5 degrees per hour, so in 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. After 10 hours, the sun will be at an angle of 32 + 50 = 82 degrees from the ground.

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

Final answer: 82"
"To find out how many candles James needs, we need to determine the age of his younger son. Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since James has two sons, he needs 2 * 5 = 10 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, the total cost will be 10 / 5 * 3 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to know how many pages she read in the first week and the second week.

We know she read 15 minutes each night for 7 nights in the first week. So, the total minutes she read in the first week is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes by dividing 105 by 1.5.

105 ÷ 1.5 = 70 pages

So, in the first week, Judy read 70 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find out how many pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first and second week.

70 + 100 = 170 pages

The final answer is: 170"
"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate.

Cody ate 1/3 of the sandwiches, which is 12 ÷ 3 = 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate 1/4 of the sandwiches, which is 12 ÷ 4 = 3 sandwiches.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches.
12 - 7 = 5

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To find Shiloh's nephew's age, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Shiloh's current age is S and his nephew's current age is N.

We know Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be S + 7 years old, and his nephew will be N + 7 years old. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break it down step by step.

The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. Then, for the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00. 

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the number of goals scored by each teenager, we need to follow the given information:

Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, and Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. We know Richie scored 80 goals. 

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M and the number of goals scored by Anna as A.

We can write an equation for the first statement: 
Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20
80 = M + 20

Solving for M:
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

We can write another equation for the second statement:
Richie's goals = Anna's goals + 45
80 = A + 45

Solving for A:
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to calculate the difference between the amount Mitchell made and the amount Liam made.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each, so we multiply 21 by 4 to find the total amount he made.

21 × 4 = 84

Liam made $63. To find the difference, we subtract 63 from 84.

84 - 63 = 21

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam."
"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

Peter spent $5 each day for 3 days (Sunday to Wednesday), so he spent a total of:
$5 * 3 = $15

He had $70 initially, so he has $70 - $15 = $55 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $55 left, so he can buy:
$55 / $2 = 27.5

Since he can't buy half a figure, he will buy 27 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have:
3 wooden action figures
27 plastic action figures

Total action figures = 3 + 27 = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200. The cost of the vaccines is 3 vaccines * $20 each, which is $60. The cost of the broken vases is 4 vases * $12 each, which is $48.

Total cost = $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The kitten has cost $308 so far."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses he needs to supply in a month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses he grows per week by 4:

40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. To find the total number of roses needed per week, we add the number of roses ordered by each shop:

20 roses + 15 roses + 30 roses = 65 roses/week

Since Ford grows 40 roses every week, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the total number of roses needed per week:

65 roses/week - 40 roses/week = 25 roses/week

Now, we multiply the number of roses he lacks per week by 4 to find the number of roses he lacks in a month:

25 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 100 roses/month

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find out how much money Katina will have left in her savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate how much she removes each month and then subtract that from the initial amount.

Since she removes $100 every month, we multiply the monthly amount by the number of months in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 months in 2 years.

$100 * 24 = $2400

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:
$3000 - $2400 = $600

The remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years is $600."
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. So, the total revenue is:

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

The food truck spends $3.00 per loaf of bread, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is:

Cost of bread = Number of loaves * Cost of bread per loaf
Cost of bread = 1 * $3.00
Cost of bread = $3.00

The food truck also spends $30.00 on cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches. So, the total cost is:

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37."
"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to first find out how many crayons she has. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together, we divide the total number of crayons by 8.

192 ÷ 8 = 24

So, Kate can make 24 muffin crayons. To find out how much money she can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin.

24 * $1.50 = $36

The final answer is $36."
"To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the cost of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation.

First, we need to find the area of the room. The room is 18 feet by 12 feet, so the area is 18 x 12 = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 x $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 x $2 = $432.

The cost of removal is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is 216 x $4 = $864.

The cost of installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is 216 x $34 = $7344.

The total cost is $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $10512.

The final answer is: $10512"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the 7 days and divide by 7.

Let's break it down:

Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
Day 3: 0 birds
Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
Day 6: 20 birds
Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90
= 280

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / 7

= 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given steps:

1. The starting value is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The resulting value is divided by 5: 10 / 5 = 2.
4. The starting value minus 12 is 20 - 12 = 8.
5. The resulting value from step 3 is multiplied by the result from step 4: 2 * 8 = 16.

The final value of the number train is 16."
"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has (5) to the number of cards his brother has. Since his brother has 3 fewer cards, we can represent the brother's cards as 5 - 3. 

5 (boy's cards) + (5 - 3) (brother's cards) = 5 + 2 = 7

The boy and his brother have a total of 7 cards together."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The oven is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees off. 
To find the percentage, we divide the difference by the original temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find 4% of 520. 
4% of 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

So, Maggie should set the oven to 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees.

The correct answer is: 540.8"
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the length of the first movie (1 hour and 30 minutes) to the length of the second movie (2 hours and 5 minutes).

First, we convert both times to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
1 hour = 60 minutes
1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 + 30 = 90 minutes
2 hours = 2 x 60 = 120 minutes
2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we add the two times:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

The total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value is $76,000. To find 30% of this value, we multiply $76,000 by 0.3.

$76,000 x 0.3 = $22,800

Now, we subtract $22,800 from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value.

$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

The value of Juan's house is $53,200. To find the combined value of both houses, we add their values.

$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first find the number of cups and dishes Judy brought.

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 x 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. To find the discounted price, we need to calculate 10% of $100.00 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $100.00 is 0.10 x $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 x $90.00 = $180.00

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes will contain 2 x 90 = 180 pairs.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs:

Cost per pair = $180.00 ÷ 180 pairs
= $1.00 per pair

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. Since she earns $10 per hour, her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. Since he also earns $10 per hour, his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running.

Aerobics burns 500 calories/hour for 2 hours, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.
Running burns 600 calories/hour for 1 hour, so the total calories burned from running is 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

Total calories burned = calories from aerobics + calories from running
Total calories burned = 1000 + 600
Total calories burned = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned.

200 calorie units = 1600 / 200
200 calorie units = 8

Since each unit requires 100 ml of water, we multiply the number of units by 100.

Total water needed = 8 * 100
Total water needed = 800 ml

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of red jelly beans and then calculate the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans.

Let's start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write an equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write an equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

2B + 0.99B = 4500

Combine like terms:

2.99B = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to add the three numbers and divide by 3.

The initial speed is 47 words per minute. Jared increased his speed by 5 words per minute, so his new speed is 47 + 5 = 52 words per minute. Then, he increased his speed by 5 words per minute again, so his new speed is 52 + 5 = 57 words per minute.

Now, let's add the three speeds:
47 + 52 + 57 = 156

To find the average, divide the sum by 3:
156 ÷ 3 = 52

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To find the difference in weight, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in 5 weeks for each option.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. 
In 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. 
In 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.5}$"
"To find the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex, the number of friends she invited, the number of friends' spouses, and the number of people she directly invited.

First, let's calculate the total number of people invited by Alex. She invited 100 people, and each of them brought 2 friends. So, the total number of friends invited is 100 * 2 = 200.

Next, Alex directly invited 10 friends, and 8 of them brought their spouses. We need to add these 8 spouses to the total count. So, the total number of additional people is 10 (friends) + 8 (friends' spouses) = 18.

Now, we add up all the people: 100 (initially invited) + 200 (friends) + 18 (friends' spouses) = 318.

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

318"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to follow the order of the weights given in the problem.

The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{220}$"
"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

Cost of boots on eBay = $13
Shipping cost on eBay = 2 * $4 = $8
Total cost on eBay = $13 + $8 = $21

To find the difference in cost between Amazon and eBay, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay.

Difference in cost = Total cost on eBay - Total cost on Amazon
= $21 - $20
= $1

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To find out how many days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to keep doubling the height of the beanstalk until it exceeds 20 feet.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it is now 8 feet tall.
Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it is now 16 feet tall.
Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it is now 32 feet tall.

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to multiply the grams of protein he gets per day by 7.

John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day, and each cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein. So, we can divide 200 grams by 3 grams to find out how many grams of protein he gets per day.

200 grams ÷ 3 grams = 66.67 grams of protein per day

Now, we multiply the grams of protein per day by 7 to find the total grams of protein per week.

66.67 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 466.67 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 466.67"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out Jerry's current age. Let's say Jerry's current age is x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

This equation means that Jerry's current age is equal to twice his age 5 years ago. We can simplify this equation by distributing the 2:

x = 2x - 10

Now, let's add 10 to both sides of the equation to get all the x terms on one side:

x + 10 = 2x

Next, we'll subtract x from both sides to get:

10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

Final answer: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work:

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the largest angle in the triangle, we need to use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x. The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

We can write an equation to represent the sum of the angles:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has.

He has 8 quarters, which is 8 x $0.25 = $2.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 x $0.10 = $0.60.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 x $0.05 = $0.70.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 x $0.01 = $0.15.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: $2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy: $3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that, so we need to subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The final weight Jamaal uses is 10 pounds."
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games

Year 2: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 2: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 17 + 5 = 22 games

Year 3: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 24 games
- Total games in Year 3: 5 (birthday) + 24 (monthly) = 29 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 29 + 5 = 34 games

To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we add the games from each year: 17 (Year 1) + 22 (Year 2) + 34 (Year 3) = 73 games.

The final answer is: $\boxed{73}$"
"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken.

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time taken to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total amount of chocolates made, we need to calculate how much each person makes in 12 hours.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how much he makes in 1 hour, we divide 120 by 2, which is 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 as much as Ruiz in 1 hour. So, we multiply 60 by 3/4 to find out how much Marissa makes in 1 hour. This is equal to (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours:
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: 1260"
"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from his original amount.

On Monday, he spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 x $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 x $16 = $64.

Total amount spent = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88

Original amount = $100

Amount left = Original amount - Total amount spent
= $100 - $88
= $12

The final answer is $12."
"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each period and add them together.

Patrick sold lemonade for 4 hours at a rate of 15 cups per hour and $0.50 per cup. 
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

Then, Patrick sold lemonade for 2 hours at a rate of 10 cups per hour and $0.60 per cup.
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is: $42"
"To find out how many years a tire will last, we need to calculate how many rotations it can do and then divide that by the number of rotations it does per year.

First, we know that the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles. So, to find out how many rotations it does per mile, we divide 725 by 2:

725 rotations ÷ 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, we know Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. To find out how many rotations he does in a month, we multiply the number of rotations per mile by the number of miles he drives:

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the total number of rotations per month by 12:

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can do by the total number of rotations per year:

10,440,000 rotations ÷ 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

The tire will last for 6 years."
"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per 120 washings = $24.00
Cost per 60 washings = $24.00 / 2 = $12.00

Now, we need to convert the cost from dollars to cents. 

$12.00 = 1200 cents

Cost per pump = 1200 cents / 60 = 20 cents

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much money Joe will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit first. 

The shirt costs $25 and there's a 30% discount. To find the discount amount, multiply the price by 0.3: $25 * 0.3 = $7.50. 

Now, subtract the discount from the original price of the shirt: $25 - $7.50 = $17.50. 

The total cost of the outfit is the sum of the discounted shirt and the shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50. 

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the tax amount: $52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20. 

The total cost of the outfit with tax is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70. 

Joe has $50, so we subtract the total cost from his money: $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70. 

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, he won't have any money left.

The final answer is $-6.70."
"To find the total amount of butter needed, we need to calculate the amount of butter required for 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days.

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we can multiply the number of croissants by 1/4 to find the amount of butter needed per day.

4 dozen croissants per day * 1/4 pound per dozen = 1 pound per day

Since Juan wants to make croissants for 7 days, we multiply the daily amount by 7:

1 pound per day * 7 days = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants per day for a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street.

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost of repaving Lewis' street: $194 × 490 = $94,660

Since the question asks how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Cost of repaving Monica's street: $194 × 150 = $29,100

Difference in cost: $94,660 - $29,100 = $65,560

The final answer is: $65,560"
"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:
$100,000 x 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 x 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 x 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

We can calculate the funding for each of the remaining 5 months as follows:
- Month 6: $100,000 x 1.5 = $150,000
- Month 7: $150,000 x 1.5 = $225,000
- Month 8: $225,000 x 1.5 = $337,500
- Month 9: $337,500 x 1.5 = $506,250
- Month 10: $506,250 x 1.5 = $759,375

Now, we add up the funding for all 10 months:
$500,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $2,077,625

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate and add them together.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).
The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."

"To find the total number of seats, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in each row. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row. 

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators. To find the number of seats occupied by administrators, we multiply the total number of seats by 1/4.

Seats occupied by administrators = 72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

The remaining seats are 72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats.

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents. To find the number of seats occupied by parents, we multiply the remaining seats by 1/3.

Seats occupied by parents = 54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats

The remaining seats are occupied by students. To find the number of seats occupied by students, we subtract the seats occupied by administrators and parents from the total seats.

Seats occupied by students = 72 seats - 18 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats

The number of students in the school auditorium is 36."
"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to calculate the total number of street lights first. There are 4 street lights at each pole, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

Now, we need to subtract the number of non-functioning street lights. There are 20 non-functioning street lights. 

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 96 - 20 = 76.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

First, let's calculate how many pieces Jim chews at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours and he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours, we can divide 8 by 2 to find out how many pieces he chews at school. 8 ÷ 2 = 4.

Next, we add the pieces he chews on the way home from school and after dinner. 4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum.

Now, we subtract the total gum chewed from the initial amount of gum. Jim initially had 20 pieces of gum. 20 - 6 = 14 pieces of gum left.

Finally, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister. 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second and then to Mb per hour.

We know that 1 Mb = 1000 kb. So, we can convert 20 kb to Mb by dividing by 1000:

20 kb ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the speed by 60:

0.02 Mb/second × 60 seconds/minute × 60 minutes/hour = 0.02 × 60 × 60 Mb/hour
= 72 Mb/hour

So, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

The tow truck pulled 10 cars per day for the first three days. So, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 6 cars per day (since it pulled 4 fewer cars per day). So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first.

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car.

The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost: $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright, we need to calculate 25% of 100, which is 0.25 * 100 = 25.

Since 60% of these riders are women, we need to find 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10.

So, 10 women can stay upright on the wave.

The number of men who can stay upright is 25 - 10 = 15.

"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to calculate the prices of gold and silver jewels first.

The price of a diamond jewel is $2000. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so we can calculate the price of a silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding the prices of diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to figure out how many of each type of stamp he bought.

We know Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, let's add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to cover the distance between them. Since they are driving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph = -15 mph

Since they are moving in the same direction, we consider the absolute difference in their speeds. The negative sign indicates that Tom is moving slower.

Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Final answer: 5"
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to figure out how many fish Darren caught first. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate:

Darren's fish = Naomi's fish - 6
Darren's fish = 17 - 6
Darren's fish = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can calculate:

Tommy's fish = Darren's fish + 3
Tommy's fish = 11 + 3
Tommy's fish = 14

The final answer is 14."
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum cost they are willing to pay.

The total cost of the classes is $60. Since they won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we can divide the total cost by the maximum cost per class to find the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for.

$60 ÷ $10 = 6 classes

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, he can miss up to 10 - 6 = 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the total weekly production, we need to calculate the daily production of Julie and Jewel.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total daily production is 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to figure out the relationship between Reggie and Lynn's distances.

We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times that amount, which is 5 x 4 = 20 miles. Since Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, we can set up an equation to find Lynn's distance:

Reggie's distance = Lynn's distance + 3
20 = Lynn's distance + 3

To solve for Lynn's distance, we need to subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

Lynn's distance = 20 - 3
Lynn's distance = 17

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of 5 apples. Since one apple costs $5.20, we multiply 5 by $5.20 to get the total cost of 5 apples.

5 x $5.20 = $26.00

Next, let's find the cost of 5 oranges. Since one orange costs $3.30, we multiply 5 by $3.30 to get the total cost of 5 oranges.

5 x $3.30 = $16.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges together to get the total cost.

$26.00 + $16.50 = $42.50

The total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges is $42.50."
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3.

Time = Volume * 3
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add up the costs of the base price and the extra features.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade is $7,500. Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new salary, we need to add the raise and bonus to his original salary.

First, we calculate the raise: 5% of $20,000 is 0.05 x $20,000 = $1,000. Then, we add the bonus, which is half a month's salary, so it's $20,000 / 2 = $10,000.

New monthly salary: $20,000 + $1,000 (raise) + $10,000 (bonus) = $31,000

To find the yearly salary, we multiply the new monthly salary by 12: $31,000 x 12 = $372,000.

The final answer is: $372,000"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the suits. James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750. So, the total cost of suits is 10 * $750 = $7,500.

Next, let's find the cost of the dress pants. The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit. Since a suit costs $750, the dress pants cost 1/5 * $750 = $150.

Now, let's find the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts for each suit, and each shirt costs $60. So, the total cost of dress shirts is 3 * $60 = $180.

Finally, let's add the costs together: $7,500 + $1,500 + $180 = $9,180.

The total cost of everything is $9,180."
"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to multiply the number of articles each website publishes per day by the number of days in February.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the news website is:
20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, let's add the total number of articles published by both websites:
560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know Steve is 60 years old. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.

Next, their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.

Lastly, their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so the son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is 29."
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags.

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Since there are three bags, the total amount of flour is 3 * 16 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add them together.

Alisa biked 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance she biked, we multiply the speed (12 miles/hour) by the time (4.5 hours).

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find the distance he biked, we multiply the speed (10 miles/hour) by the time (2.5 hours).

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, let's add the distances together:
54 miles (Alisa) + 25 miles (Stanley) = 79 miles

The total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

Since Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, we can divide the total feet of soil (24) by his speed to find the time it takes to dig through the soil. 

Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Since Bill can dig half as fast through clay, his speed is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour. 

Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to calculate the number of cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.

He gets 2 cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and each of his 25 classmates. To find the total number of cupcakes, we multiply the number of classmates by 2 (since each gets 2 cupcakes) and add the 2 cupcakes for himself and his teacher.

Total number of cupcakes = (25 x 2) + 2 + 2
= 50 + 4
= 54

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"To find the initial number of likes, we need to divide the total number of likes by 70.

Total likes = 2000 + 20000 = 22000
Initial likes = Total likes / 70
Initial likes = 22000 / 70
Initial likes = 314.29

Since we can't have a fraction of a like, we can round down to 314 likes.

Now, we add the 20000 new likes to the initial likes to find the total number of likes.

Total likes = Initial likes + 20000
Total likes = 314 + 20000
Total likes = 20114

The final answer is 20114."
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off. So, the total cost on Tuesday is:
20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
$2 discount = $400 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost on Wednesday is:
20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
10% discount = $600 * 0.1 = $60
$60 discount = $600 - $60 = $540

The difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
$398 - $540 = -$142

The final answer is: $142"
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we need to calculate the sales for each month.

Let's start by finding the sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were $400 and that's half of the total sales from green hats, we can multiply $400 by 2 to find the sales from green hats. 

$400 * 2 = $800

The total sales in the first month were $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find 3/4 of $1200, we multiply $1200 by 3 and then divide by 4.

$1200 * 3 = $3600
$3600 ÷ 4 = $900

The total sales in two months were $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and multiply it by the cost per hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30.

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"To find out how much was withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her weekly wage.

Weekly wage: $300
Bank account balance: $420

Subtract the bank account balance from the weekly wage:
$300 - $420 = -$120

Since the result is negative, it means that Sally's bank account was overdrawn by $120. This means that $120 was withheld from her wage.

The amount withheld from Sally's wage is $120."
"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat.

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3

Total deviled egg halves needed: 16 x 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 2 deviled egg halves per egg, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs needed.

Total eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens.

Total dozens of eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

The final answer is 2."
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages.

Total pages = 15
Pages already written = 1/3 of 15 = 5

= 15 - 5
= 10

Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 ÷ 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline.

Days before deadline = Deadline - Number of days
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the monthly rent, which is $5000 x 2 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is $5000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost for the first year is $15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

The total cost of the plane for the first year is $150,000 (plane cost) + $180,000 (total monthly cost) = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To find the total cooking time, we need to calculate the time it took to cook each food item. We know it took 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, the combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. The cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we add up the cooking times for all three foods: 30 minutes for rice, 50 minutes for pork, and 40 minutes for beans. The total cooking time is 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find the difference in cost between the two mixtures, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then subtract the cost of the second mixture from the cost of the first mixture.

The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is $5 and the cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is $5. So, the total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is $2 and the cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is $5. So, the total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures. To do this, we subtract the cost of the second mixture from the cost of the first mixture.

Difference in cost = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture

"To solve this problem, we need to use a system of equations. Let's say the number of sheep is 's' and the number of geese is 'g'. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20.

We can write two equations based on this information:

4s + 2g = 70 (total number of legs)
s + g = 20 (total number of heads)

We can solve for 's' by substituting the value of 'g' from the second equation into the first equation.

Rearranging the second equation to isolate 'g', we get:
g = 20 - s

Substituting this expression for 'g' into the first equation, we get:
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s + 40 = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, that's 7 pounds. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is $1, so the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. 

7 pounds of the more expensive brand will cost 7 x $6 = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2.

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent.

First, let's add up the cost of the chips and the chicken and soda: $2.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $11.00

Now, subtract this total from the amount Gus spent: $20.00 - $11.00 = $9.00

The apple pie cost $9.00."
"To find the number of newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Let's do the math:

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)

"To find out how much money each person would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally, we need to follow these steps:

First, we know that Aurelia has $120.

Next, we need to find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we multiply Aurelia's money by 3/4. This can be written as (3/4) * 120.

To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator (3) by the whole number (120) and then divide by the denominator (4). So, (3/4) * 120 = (3 * 120) / 4 = 360 / 4 = 90.

Now that we know Kassidy has $90, we can find out how much Rayna has. Since Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, we add 60 to Kassidy's money: 90 + 60 = 150.

Next, we add up the money of all three: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360.

To share the money equally among them, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 / 3 = 120.

So, each person would have $120.

"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches, we need to calculate the difference in height first. 

The difference in height is 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the difference in height by the growth rate to find the number of days: 360 ÷ 30 = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

Final answer: 12"
"To find the total number of toys James needs, we can break it down into steps.

First, we know James initially had 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means he had 1 toy per dog. Then, 8 more dogs were added, making the total number of dogs 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James initially needed 12 toys.

However, when James came back, he found that 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. This means he only needs toys for 12 - 3 = 9 dogs.

Since James initially had 4 toys, he needs to buy 9 - 4 = 5 more toys.

The total number of toys James needs is 9 (initially needed) + 5 (additional needed) = 14 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the steps below:

First, we find out how much Dylan invested. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we multiply 1200 by 2/5:

1200 × 2/5 = 480

Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount:

1200 - 480 = 720

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. We multiply 720 by 2/3:

720 × 2/3 = 480

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to figure out how many cookies each person has.

We know Katarina has 68 cookies. Since she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find Max's cookies by adding 5 to Katarina's cookies.

Max's cookies = Katarina's cookies + 5
Max's cookies = 68 + 5
Max's cookies = 73

We also know Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, we can find the Cookie Monster's cookies by subtracting 12 from Max's cookies.

Cookie Monster's cookies = Max's cookies - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 73 - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 61

Lastly, Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. We can find Summer's cookies by adding 23 to Max's cookies.

Summer's cookies = Max's cookies + 23
Summer's cookies = 73 + 23
Summer's cookies = 96

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to figure out what number, when increased by 50%, and then having 20cm added to it, equals 140cm.

Let's call the original length ""x"". When we increase it by 50%, we multiply it by 1.5. So, the new length is 1.5x.

Then, 20cm is added to the new length. The equation for this situation is:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5 to find x:

x = 120 ÷ 1.5
x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode is 1 hour, which is equal to 60 minutes. 
Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode is 40 minutes.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to add the time taken for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they've already spent from the total time available.

They have 30 minutes to get to school. It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is, and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. So, the total time spent so far is 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

Time left = Total time available - Time spent so far
Time left = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Time left = 11 minutes

They have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 x $2 = $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 x $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Catherine pays a total of $14."
"To find the total number of cookies baked, we need to calculate the number of cookies Celinda bakes, which is twice the number of cookies Greta bakes.

Greta bakes 30 cookies, so Celinda bakes 2 x 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (Greta) + 60 (Celinda) = 90 cookies.

The pair eats 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left in the box is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We have two sets of siblings: one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44.

Let's say the age of the younger triplet is x. Then, the age of the older triplet is x + 7, and the age of the older twin is x + 7 + 7 = x + 14.

We can set up an equation to represent the total age: x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms: 3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides: 3x = 23

Divide both sides by 3: x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 14 = 7.67 + 14 = 21.67.

Since the age of the older twin is 21.67, we can look at the answer choices to find the correct answer.

A) 13
B) 14
C) 15
D) 21.67

The correct answer is D."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has available before dinner. 

First, we convert 3 hours into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes/hour:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Next, we add up the time for all his homework:
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time:
180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops, we need to multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, we can calculate this as follows:

10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00

Now, we need to find the total cost of 10 candies. We know that Manolo bought 4 candies for $3.20, so we can find the cost of one candy by dividing $3.20 by 4:

$3.20 ÷ 4 = $0.80

Now, we can multiply the cost of one candy by 10 to find the total cost of 10 candies:

10 candies * $0.80 = $8.00

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:

$4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 120 (12 months in a year).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Total coins Rong saves in a year = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Total coins Neil saves in a year = 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Total coins Rong saves in 10 years = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Total coins Neil saves in 10 years = 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

Total coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins

The final answer is: $\boxed{5760}$"
"To find the total cost of the vaccines, we need to multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2. Since each vaccine costs $20, the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. We can set up the equation: 0.6x = 40. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.6: x = 40 / 0.6 = 66.67.

The total bill is $66.67. Now, we subtract the total bill from the amount John brought with him to find out how much he leaves with: $125 - $66.67 = $58.33.

The final answer is: $58.33"

"To find the total number of squares, we need to find the number of each color and add them together.

Let's start with the red squares. We know there are 14 red squares.

The blue squares are 4 more than the red squares, so we add 4 to the number of red squares: 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

The green squares are 6 more than the blue squares, so we add 6 to the number of blue squares: 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

The white squares are 12 fewer than the green squares, so we subtract 12 from the number of green squares: 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field."
"To find the total points, we need to calculate the points for each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points for all students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. 
The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points.

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks in the city and the number of fireworks in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks in the city. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so we multiply 15 by 20 to get the total number of fireworks in the city.

15 * 20 = 300

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4.

300 * 0.4 = 120

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard. There are 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so we multiply 3 by 5 to get the total number of fireworks in her backyard.

3 * 5 = 15

"To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry and then subtract that from the total amount the three trucks can carry.

Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

The total amount the three trucks can carry is 11,600 pounds. To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the amount Gissela and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total: 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"To find the total number of dumplings, we need to figure out how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is also 50.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used for industrial purposes and then subtract that from 100%.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

So, the percentage of water used for industrial purposes is 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, subtract this from 100% to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes: 100% - 32% = 68%.

Therefore, 68% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

First, let's add up the cost of each item:
5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
3 mini quiches at $4.00 each: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

To apply the 10% discount, we need to multiply the total cost by 0.10:
$50.00 x 0.10 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to inches. 

First, we convert 8 feet to inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Then we add the 4 inches: 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. We are told that this is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. 

We can write the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed by students and teachers separately.

Number of windows smashed by students: 
Number of students' cars = 64
Number of windows per car = 4
Total windows smashed by students = 64 * 4 = 256

Number of windows smashed by teachers: 
Number of teachers' cars = 32
Number of windows per car = 2
Total windows smashed by teachers = 32 * 2 = 64

Total windows smashed = 256 (students) + 64 (teachers) = 320

"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools.

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Now, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

To find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to follow these steps:

First, we calculate the number of people who voted by midday. Since 2/5 of 5000 people voted, we can find this by multiplying 5000 by 2/5.

5000 * (2/5) = 2000

Next, we subtract the number of people who voted by midday from the total number of people to find the number of people remaining.

5000 - 2000 = 3000

Then, we calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00. Since 2/3 of the remaining people voted, we multiply 3000 by 2/3.

3000 * (2/3) = 2000

Finally, we subtract the number of people who voted by 16:00 from the number of people remaining to find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

3000 - 2000 = 1000

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last (30 days) by the number of pieces of gum he chews per day (4).

30 ÷ 4 = 7.5

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure he has enough gum for the entire 30 days. So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To find the total number of smores needed, we need to calculate the number of smores for kids and adults separately.

For kids: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
For adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores

Total smores needed: 18 + 6 = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we need to divide the total number of smores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 boxes of graham crackers.

Final answer: 3"
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to calculate each of their ages first.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Combined age = Dora's age + father's age + mother's age
= 15 + 38 + 34
= 87 years.

The final answer is: 87"

"To find out how many apples Beck has, we need to subtract 23 from Boris's initial amount of apples.

Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. 
So, Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. 
Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.
Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's current amount from Boris's current amount.

"To find out how much the vendor saves per week, we need to calculate the difference in cost between the old vendor and the new vendor.

The old vendor sells tomatoes for $0.50 each, and the new vendor sells them for $0.40 each. The vendor buys 500 tomatoes a day. 

First, we calculate the cost of the tomatoes from the old vendor: 
500 tomatoes/day * $0.50/tomato = $250/day

Next, we calculate the cost of the tomatoes from the new vendor: 
500 tomatoes/day * $0.40/tomato = $200/day

Now, we find the difference in cost per day: 
$250/day - $200/day = $50/day

To find out how much the vendor saves per week, we multiply the daily savings by 7: 
$50/day * 7 days/week = $350/week

The vendor saves $350 per week."
"To find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we need to figure out how many marbles each of them has.

"To find the total number of chairs Candy can rent in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. So, the total number of weekdays in 4 weeks is 5 * 4 = 20. Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in 4 weeks is 20 * 60 = 1200.

Next, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during weekends. There are 2 weekend days in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. So, the total number of weekend days in 4 weeks is 2 * 4 = 8. Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in 4 weeks is 8 * 100 = 800.

Now, let's add the total number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends to find the total number of chairs Candy can rent in 4 weeks. Total chairs rented in 4 weeks = 1200 + 800 = 2000.

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to calculate the initial number of glasses and plates and then subtract the number of broken ones.

Jeff initially sent 8 dozen glasses, which is equal to 8 x 12 = 96 glasses. He also sent 4 dozen plates, which is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 plates.

When they were returned, 10 glasses were broken, so we need to subtract 10 from the initial number of glasses: 96 - 10 = 86 glasses.

Similarly, 6 plates were broken, so we need to subtract 6 from the initial number of plates: 48 - 6 = 42 plates.

To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we add the remaining glasses and plates: 86 + 42 = 128.

The final answer is: 128"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. This means she gives away 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. So, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. This is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

Then, she trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since she has 20 large stickers left, she trades them for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers. She has 20 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of votes against the regulation is x. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

"To find the total number of shirts, we need to calculate the number of students for each size and add them up.

Let's start with the extra-small shirts. We know that 11 students need size extra-small.

Since twice as many students need size small as extra-small, we multiply 11 by 2 to get the number of small shirts: 11 * 2 = 22.

Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so we subtract 4 from 22: 22 - 4 = 18.

Half as many students need size large as size medium, so we divide 18 by 2: 18 / 2 = 9.

Six more students need size extra-large than large, so we add 6 to 9: 9 + 6 = 15.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75.

"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we need to first find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. This can be calculated by multiplying 0.2 and 50, which equals 10 people.

Now, we need to find 60% of the remaining people who think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. To find 60% of 40, we multiply 0.6 and 40, which equals 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. Since 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 and horse #7 will win, we subtract 34 from 50 to find the number of people who think horse #12 will win. This equals 50 - 34 = 16 people.

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to figure out how many puppies are Pomeranians first. We know that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 girls. 

Let's use a simple equation to find the total number of Pomeranians: 
1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To solve for Total Pomeranians, we multiply both sides by 3:
Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can find the total number of puppies. Since 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up another equation:
2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides by 3/2:
Total Puppies = 18 * 3/2
Total Puppies = 27

The final answer is 27."

Initial amount of money = $80
Cost of the ball = $20
Remaining money = Initial amount of money - Cost of the ball
Remaining money = $80 - $20 = $60

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many candy bars Marissa bought.

"To find the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer, we need to calculate the total time she spends on other activities and subtract that from her total weekend time.

Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so her total weekend time is 7 + 5 = 12 hours.

She reads for 3 hours, and then plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. To find the remaining time, we subtract the time she reads from her total weekend time: 12 - 3 = 9 hours.

Since she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, we multiply 9 hours by 1/3: 9 * 1/3 = 3 hours.

Now, we subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time to find the time she spends playing soccer: 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of her weekend that she spends playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100: (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 50 - 25 = 25 pencils
3. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 25 - 15 = 10 pencils

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum.

Time to drive to the museum:
Distance = 150 miles
Speed = 75 mph
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 / 75
Time = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home, we need to double the time:
Total time to drive to and from the museum = 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Adding the time spent at the museum:
Total time gone from home = Time to drive to and from the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time gone from home = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of wheels needed, we need to calculate the number of wheels for the cars and the number of wheels for the motorcycles.

For the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels
For the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Total number of wheels needed: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Now, let's subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

The number of wheels left in the box is 276."
"To find the amount you have to pay after a 20% discount, you need to calculate 20% of the original price of the laptop.

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$1000 - $200 = $800

You have to pay $800."
"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
Number of movies in series = 600 / 3
Number of movies in series = 200

Since Mike can get the series for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, we need to find the cost of the series:

Cost of series = Number of movies in series * $6
Cost of series = 200 * $6
Cost of series = $1200

Next, we need to find the number of remaining movies that are not in series. We can do this by subtracting the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
Number of remaining movies = 600 - 200
Number of remaining movies = 400

Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate the number of older movies as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of remaining movies * 0.4
Number of older movies = 400 * 0.4
Number of older movies = 160

The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so we can calculate the total cost of the older movies:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * $5
Cost of older movies = 160 * $5
Cost of older movies = $800

Now, we need to find the cost of the normal movies. Since there are 400 remaining movies and 160 of them are older movies, the number of normal movies is:

Number of normal movies = Number of remaining movies - Number of older movies
Number of normal movies = 400 - 160
Number of normal movies = 240

The cost of the normal movies is $10 each, so we can calculate the total cost of the normal movies:

Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * $10
Cost of normal movies = 240 * $10
Cost of normal movies = $2400

Finally, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies by adding the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies:

Total cost = Cost of series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
Total cost = $1200 + $800 + $2400
Total cost = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"
"To find the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of each type of fruit:

Peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
Plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
Apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The total amount Winston spent on fruit is $38.00."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to calculate the total time they spent driving and add it to the time they spent hiking. 

The Llesis family drove for 6 hours and hiked for 1.5 hours. 

Since they hiked at 20 miles per hour, we can use the formula:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 20 * 1.5
Distance = 30 miles

The distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles.

30"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them earned.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma's score: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's score: 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820

Ava's score:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies.
- She collects 5 fewer berries than Emma, so she collects 8 - 5 = 3 berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's score: 80 * 10 (for enemies) + 3 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 800 + 15 + 900 = 1715

The difference between their scores is 1715 - 820 = 895.

The final answer is: $\boxed{895}$"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

Let's do the math:
64 - 30 = 34

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2:
34 ÷ 2 = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. This is a total of 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual amount, so they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times each day. This is a total of 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on both types of days: 15 + 12 = 27 times.

The final answer is 27."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. He took out 14 orange fish and 3 white fish. Now, he has -11 orange fish and 1 white fish.

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

-11 = 2(1)

However, this equation is not true. Let's try again.

Let's say Bob took out x orange fish and y white fish. We know that x + y = 17 (the total number of fish taken out). We also know that 3 - x = -11 (the number of orange fish left) and 4 - y = 1 (the number of white fish left).

We can solve these equations to find the values of x and y.

3 - x = -11
x = 14

4 - y = 1
y = 3

So, Bob took out 14 orange fish and 3 white fish.

Now, we can find the number of white fish Bob bought at the store:

Number of white fish bought = y = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then divide it by his fuel efficiency.

Since Andy travels to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles per day.

Total distance traveled in a week = 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles

Now, we can calculate the amount of gas consumed per week:

Gas consumed per week = Total distance traveled / Fuel efficiency
= 50 miles / 10 MPG
= 5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of gas consumed per week:

Cost of gas consumed per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
= 5 gallons * $3/gallon
= $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the quarters and the amount she spent on the twenties.

Carrie had 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties. She spent 6 twenties, so she has 10 - 6 = 4 twenties left.

Carrie had 140 quarters. She spent all of them.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she spent:
- She spent 6 twenties, which is 6 * 20 = $120.
- She spent 140 quarters, which is 140 * 0.25 = $35.

The total amount she spent is $120 + $35 = $155.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs.
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to calculate the difference between the total cost of the trip and the amount of money John has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school is covering half the cost, John needs to cover the other half. Half of $300 is $300 / 2 = $150.

John has $50. To find out how much he is missing, we subtract the amount he has from the amount he needs to cover: $150 - $50 = $100.

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we need to calculate the temperature difference between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night. So, the temperature difference is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we divide the temperature difference by the heating capacity of one log:

12 ÷ 5 = 2.4

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the house is warm enough. 

Carson needs to burn 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

Final answer: 3"
"To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group.

90 people ÷ 9 people per group = 10 groups

Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of 10 groups.

3/5 * 10 = 6 groups

Each group had 2 seashells, so we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought.

6 groups * 2 seashells per group = 12 seashells

The final answer is 12."
"To find the number of people on the train, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. Initially, there are 172 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so the number of people left is 172 - 47 = 125.
3. Then, 13 more people get on, so the number of people on the train is now 125 + 13 = 138.
4. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so the number of people left is 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train."

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract that from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 x $40 = $10

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $40 - $10 = $30.

Now, we subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Mike will have $20 left over."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to find the total number of employees and multiply it by the salary per employee.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after 3 months, the total number of employees will be:
200 + 20 = 220 (after 1 month)
220 + 20 = 240 (after 2 months)
240 + 20 = 260 (after 3 months)

The total number of employees after 3 months is 260. Each employee is paid $4000 per month. To find the total salary paid, we multiply the total number of employees by the salary per employee:

260 * $4000 = $1,040,000

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises.

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Since Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings will be 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 

Sally also works 20 hours, so her total earnings will be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has and then figure out how many more she needs to make the percentage of stuffed goats 30%.

First, let's add up the number of stuffed animals she already has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Now, we want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Let's call the number of stuffed goats x. We can set up an equation:

(14 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.3

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get:

14 + x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

14 + x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 14 from both sides gives:

x = 0.3x + 0.2

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides gives:

0.7x = 0.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7 gives:

x = 0.2 / 0.7
x = 2/7
x = 0.2857

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 2 stuffed goats to make the percentage 30% of all her stuffed animals.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car passed the first car, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them.

Distance between the two cars = 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

Let's start by finding the total number of students who passed:
Third-graders who passed: 340
Fourth-graders who passed: 40
Fifth-graders who passed: 2 * 40 = 80

Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100

So, the overall pass rate is 46%."
"To find the length of the mosaic, we need to calculate the total area first. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, and we have 144 chips, we can find the total area.

Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips
Chips per square inch = 12
Total area = Total chips / Chips per square inch = 144 / 12 = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height.

Length = Total area / Height = 12 / 3 = 4 inches

"To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the amount each group drank and add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount of tea the 4 students drank. Since each student drank 1.5 quarts, we multiply 4 students by 1.5 quarts: 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts.

Next, let's calculate the amount of tea the 16 students drank. Since each student drank 2 quarts, we multiply 16 students by 2 quarts: 16 x 2 = 32 quarts.

Now, we add the amount of tea the 4 students drank to the amount the 16 students drank: 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the initial amount of tea was 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts). So, 48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Dale started with 100 candies and ordered 100 more, so he now has 100 + 100 = 200 candies.

He sold 150 candies, so to find out how many he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies: 200 - 150 = 50.

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the total number of S'mores they can make is 32.

John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2.

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 18 / 2 = 9

So, John and DeSean can each have 9 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

Final answer: 9"
"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the time each person played and multiply it by the cost per game.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes per quarter, he will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

His friend who is significantly worse plays for half the time, so they play for 120 minutes. This person will use 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.

The other friend plays for 120 minutes as well, so they will also use 6 quarters.

The better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 1.5 * 240 = 360 minutes. This person will use 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

Now, let's add up the quarters used by each person: 12 + 6 + 6 + 18 = 42 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is 42 * $0.25 = $10.50.

The final answer is: $10.50"
"To find out how much oil Tanya uses, we need to figure out how much of each ingredient she uses. We know that she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. Let's call the amount of salt used ""x"". Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil used is 2x.

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. The total amount of the mixture is the sum of the amounts of salt, citrus zest, fragrance, and oil. Since the amount of citrus zest and fragrance is the same, we can say that the amount of citrus zest and fragrance is x. So, the equation is:

x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms:

4x = 10

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 2.5

Now that we know the amount of salt used is 2.5 ounces, we can find the amount of oil used:

Oil = 2x
Oil = 2 * 2.5
Oil = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

The total amount of money John spent is $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already has = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already has
= 63 - 48
= 15

So, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To find out how many cars Joe has left, we need to follow the steps below:

Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Then, Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

After selling 8 cars, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

Next, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Finally, after giving away 16 cars, Joe is left with 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity.

The charity raised a total of $175,000, and $50,000 came from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Since there are 20 students, we need to divide the amount raised by students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the second day first.

Time walked on the first day = 8 hours
Time walked on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Total time walked in two days = 8 + 4 = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes)
Total time in minutes = 12 * 60 = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

First, we need to find the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break. We know that there were initially 50 cars and 20 more cars arrived during the first break. So, the total number of cars is 50 + 20 = 70.

Then, we need to find 1/2 of the total number of cars, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35. This is the number of cars that left during the lunch break.

To find the number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35.

So, Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break.

The final answer is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a week and then multiply it by the payment per task.

Number of tasks per cycle = 5
Number of cycles per day = 30
Number of days in a week = 7

Total number of tasks per day = 5 * 30 = 150
Total number of tasks in a week = 150 * 7 = 1050

Payment per task = $1.20
Total payment per week = 1050 * $1.20 = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's add the points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we need to calculate the total number of tins of each type of food.

Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food is 8 * 11 = 88.

She also bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food is 6 * 6 = 36.

Now, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is 52."
"To solve this problem, we need to use variables to represent the number of cards each person has. Let's say PJ has x cards.

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

So, Becca has 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and add them together.

Let's start by finding the number of blue eggs. Since Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, and she had 5 green eggs, we can multiply 5 by 2 to get the number of blue eggs.

Number of blue eggs = 2 * 5 = 10

Next, we need to find the number of pink eggs. Since Cindy had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, we can subtract 1 from the number of blue eggs.

Number of pink eggs = 10 - 1 = 9

Now, we need to find the number of yellow eggs. Since Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, we can divide the number of pink eggs by 3.

Number of yellow eggs = 9 ÷ 3 = 3

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together:

Total number of eggs = 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To calculate how much Milly will lose, we need to figure out the cost of shipping and the refund amount.

The shipping cost is calculated by multiplying the weight of the book by the cost per pound and then adding the distance multiplied by the cost per mile. So, the shipping cost is:

$0.35 per pound * 4 pounds = $1.40
$1.40 + $0.08 per mile * 20 miles = $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.00

The refund amount is 75% of the purchase price, which is:

0.75 * $32 = $24

Since Milly will have to pay the shipping cost, we subtract the refund amount from the purchase price:

$32 - $24 - $2 = $6

So, Milly will lose $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had.

Mulan starts with $40 and gets $100 from her father, so the total amount is $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans for $30 each, so the total cost of the jeans is 2 * $30 = $60. She also buys a bag for $20. The total cost is $60 + $20 = $80.

To find out how much money Mulan has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $140 - $80 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

Boris produces 8,000 bars in the first week. In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Since the production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars, we can subtract this from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

Total monthly production: 50,000 bars
Production for the first three weeks: 36,000 bars
Production for the fourth week: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and add them together.

She records 18 videos per week, and each video takes 4 minutes. So, the total time spent recording videos per week is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes. Converting this to hours, we get 72 minutes / 60 = 1.2 hours.

She spends 2 hours a week writing songs and 1.5 hours a week doing her makeup. 

Total time spent on TikTok per week: 1.2 hours (recording) + 2 hours (writing) + 1.5 hours (makeup) = 4.7 hours/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent on TikTok in a month is 4.7 hours/week * 4 weeks = 18.8 hours.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items are: 
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

The cost of the standard items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 
- Mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 extra mirrors
- Chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 extra chandelier
- Pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 extra pictures

The cost of the additional items is: 
- 2 extra mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
- 1 extra chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
- 10 extra pictures * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

The total cost for Angela is: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to figure out how much money his brother Anthony has first. Since Anthony has $10 more than their sister Eva, and Eva has $20, Anthony has $20 + $10 = $30.

Now, we know that Roy has 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's money, we multiply Anthony's money by 0.4. 40% of $30 is 0.4 x $30 = $12.

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's money to find Roy's money. $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Then, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches. After that, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches. Finally, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). So, Naruto can lift 480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first 4 hours + Distance in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of one kangaroo first. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, the speed of a turtle is:

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Since the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can use the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway to find the time it will take for 4 turtles. We can set up an equation:

Time taken by kangaroos = Time taken by turtles
18 hours = 4 turtles * Time taken by a turtle
Time taken by a turtle = 18 hours / 4
Time taken by a turtle = 4.5 hours

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 4.5 hours to travel across the highway.

"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to calculate the number of dishes each one made.

Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, let's add up the number of dishes each one made: 
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140

The total number of clay dishes they all made together is 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already has some savings in her purse, and she has been paid $150 for her part-time job. Her mom also agreed to give her $80. So, the total amount she has is the sum of these three amounts.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as x. We know that x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 (the amount she still needs to buy the laptop).

x + 230 = 350

Now, let's solve for x:

x = 350 - 230
x = 120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"To find the total number of apple slices, we need to calculate the number of slices from the large apples and the small apples separately.

First, let's calculate the number of slices from the large apples. Since 1 large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, 3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 slices.

Next, let's calculate the number of slices from the small apples. Since 1 small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, 5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Now, we add the number of slices from the large apples and the small apples to find the total number of slices. Total number of slices = 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is 15."

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 5/6 by the original length of 12 mm:
(5/6) * 12 = 10 mm

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/3 by the original length of 12 mm:
(1/3) * 12 = 4 mm

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/2 by the original length of 12 mm:
(1/2) * 12 = 6 mm

Now, we add the lengths of the used parts together:
10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 mm."

"To find the total number of socks and dishes, we need to break down the information given.

We know that Jack collected 60 dishes and that he has twice as many dishes as socks. So, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing 60 by 2.

60 ÷ 2 = 30 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying 30 by 2.

30 × 2 = 60 socks

Now, we can find the total number of socks they have together by adding Jack's socks and Peter's socks.

30 + 60 = 90 socks

We also know that Jack has twice as many dishes as socks. So, we can find the number of dishes Jack has by multiplying 30 by 2.

30 × 2 = 60 dishes

Since Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, we can find the number of dishes Peter has by dividing 60 by 2.

60 ÷ 2 = 30 dishes

Now, we can find the total number of dishes they have together by adding Jack's dishes and Peter's dishes.

60 + 30 = 90 dishes

"To find the number of students good at math, we need to know how many students are good at both math and English. We can do this by subtracting the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Let's break it down:

Total number of students = 20
Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Total number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English

"To find out how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to subtract the time taken by each group and the intermission from the total time of the concert.

The total time of the concert is 2 hours, which is equal to 120 minutes. Each group takes 10 minutes (2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage). There's also a 10-minute intermission.

Total time taken by each group and intermission = 10 minutes (group) + 10 minutes (intermission) = 20 minutes

Now, we subtract the total time taken by each group and intermission from the total time of the concert.

Number of groups that can perform = Total time of the concert - Total time taken by each group and intermission
= 120 minutes - 20 minutes
= 100 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, we can convert 100 minutes to hours and minutes.

100 minutes = 1 hour and 40 minutes

Now, we can divide the total time of the concert by the time taken by each group and intermission.

Number of groups that can perform = 2 hours (concert) / 1 hour and 40 minutes (time taken by each group and intermission)
= 2 hours / 1 hour and 40 minutes
= 2 / 1.67
= 1.2

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of groups that can perform = 1

However, we also need to consider the 10-minute intermission. We can fit one more group in the remaining 10 minutes.

Number of groups that can perform = 1 + 1
= 2

Mr. Smith had 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y. Twice as many goats from Farm Y means he sold 2 x 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y.

The number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.
The number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 + 25 = 70.

Therefore, there are 70 goats left in the two farms altogether."

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
3 * $25 = $75

Next, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount. Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, we subtract $2 from the original cost of each basket:
$18 - $2 = $16
Then, we multiply the discounted cost by 3:
3 * $16 = $48

Now, we add the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food:
$75 + $48 = $123

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

Final answer: 15"
"To find the total number of homes built, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that you are 3 years younger than your brother, so your brother's age is x + 3. You are 2 years older than your sister, so your sister's age is x - 2. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, which is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of your ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the answer should be a whole number. Let's re-evaluate the equation.

5x + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78

Divide by 5: x = 15.6

Since age cannot be a fraction, we'll try to find a whole number solution.

Let's try x = 15 and x = 16.

If x = 15, then your brother's age is 15 + 3 = 18, your sister's age is 15 - 2 = 13, and your mom's age is 3(18) - 1 = 53.

The sum of your ages is 15 + 18 + 13 + 53 = 99, which is greater than 87.

If x = 16, then your brother's age is 16 + 3 = 19, your sister's age is 16 - 2 = 14, and your mom's age is 3(19) - 1 = 56.

The sum of your ages is 16 + 19 + 14 + 56 = 85, which is less than 87.

Since 16 is closer to 15.6, we can try x = 16.

If x = 16, then your brother's age is 16 + 3 = 19, your sister's age is 16 - 2 = 14, and your mom's age is 3(19) - 1 = 56.

"To find the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day, we need to add the amount of water on the second day to the increase in water on the third day.

The amount of water on the second day is 2 times the amount on the first day, which is 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

The increase in water on the third day is 6000 gallons. To find the total amount of water on the third day, we add this increase to the amount on the second day: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day and add it to the total number of infected people.

Let's break it down:

Day 1: 10 people are initially infected.
10 people infect 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 new infections.
Total infected after Day 1: 10 + 60 = 70.

Day 2: 70 people are infected, and each infects 6 others.
70 * 6 = 420 new infections.
Total infected after Day 2: 70 + 420 = 490.

Day 3: 490 people are infected, and each infects 6 others.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to figure out how many silver coins she had. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 
x = 40 

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 
Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) = 110

The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. So, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the total number of cars is 75, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"To solve this problem, we need to use variables to represent the number of books each person has. Let's say Fawn has x books. Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. To do this, we multiply 7/13 by 26.

7/13 * 26 = 14.31 (round down to 14 since you can't eat a fraction of a piece)

"To find out how much money David has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts. 

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be:
16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to calculate her hourly rate first.

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Total hours
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now, we can multiply the hourly rate by the total hours she will work to find her total earnings.

Total earnings = Hourly rate * Total hours
Total earnings = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Total earnings = $132

The final answer is: $132"
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the steps:

Paul starts with 52 marbles. His friend gives him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles. Then, he loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is 20. So, he loses 20 marbles. Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total: 80 - 20 = 60.

Paul has 60 marbles left.

The final answer is 60."
"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. There are 10 questions, and Amy answers 80% of them correctly. To find 80% of 10, we multiply 10 by 0.8.

10 x 0.8 = 8

Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, Amy gets 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. There are 20 questions, and Amy answers 90% of them correctly. To find 90% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.9.

20 x 0.9 = 18

Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, Amy gets 18 points from the true/false questions.

Now, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. There are 5 questions, and Amy answers 60% of them correctly. To find 60% of 5, we multiply 5 by 0.6.

5 x 0.6 = 3

Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, Amy gets 3 x 5 = 15 points from the long-answer questions.

To find Amy's total score, we add the points from each type of question.

8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41

The final answer is 41."
"To find the cost price of the chickens, we need to divide the total amount of money Isaias wants to make ($2000) by the profit he wants to make ($2000) and then multiply it by the number of chickens he plans to sell (3/5 of 300).

First, let's find 3/5 of 300:

3/5 * 300 = 180

Now, we know Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each. To find the total amount of money he will make, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price:

180 * 50 = $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we subtract the desired profit from the total amount of money he will make:

$9000 - $2000 = $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we need to know how many glasses Micah sold. Since Julie and the boys sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses sold by 3.

32 glasses ÷ 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

Now, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales:

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

The answer is 3.33 glasses."
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so the total cost is:
20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Sarah has the rope for $2 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so she has:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount Sarah has:
$40 - $30 = $10

So, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

The final answer is: $10"
"To find the number of years when Melanie's age will be thrice her present age, we need to set up an equation. Let's say her present age is x. In 16 years, her age will be x + 16. We want to find when her age will be 3 times her present age, so we set up the equation:

x + 16 = 3x

Now, we need to solve for x. Subtract x from both sides of the equation:

16 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2:

8 = x

So, Melanie's present age is 8. Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be 3 times her present age. We know that 3 times her present age is 3 * 8 = 24. Since she is currently 8 years old, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be 24.

24 - 8 = 16 years.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:
- 5 packs of bacon cost $10.
- 6 packets of chicken cost 6 x 2 = $12.
- 3 packs of strawberries cost 3 x $4 = $12.
- 7 packs of apples cost 7 x $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$10 + $12 + $12 + $14 = $48

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
$65 - $48 = $17

Kelly has $17 left in her budget."
"To find the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert and then divide by 2.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert: 65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes.
2. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we divide the runtime without encore by 2: 50 minutes ÷ 2 = 25 minutes.

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had initially.

Argo initially had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. To find the total number of toys given away, we add 40 + 80 + 30 = 150.

Now, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50.

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas each day, so the total for these two days is 125 + 125 = 250.

On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas, so they make 2 x 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we need to first find the number of microphones that can fit. Since 20% of the microphones won't fit, we need to find 80% of the total number of microphones.

Let's calculate 80% of 50: 0.8 * 50 = 40.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is 40 / 2 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate each group separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds in the bushes are flying overhead, we can multiply the number of birds in the bushes by 2/3.

Number of birds flying overhead = (2/3) * 6
= 2 * 6 / 3
= 12 / 3
= 4

Next, we need to calculate the total number of birds feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we can multiply 3 by 8.

Number of birds feeding = 3 * 8
= 24

Now, we can add the number of birds in the bushes, the number of birds flying overhead, and the number of birds feeding to find the total number of birds.

Total number of birds = 6 + 4 + 24
= 34

The final answer is 34."
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to subtract the number of cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies she baked.

Total cookies baked = 55
Cookies eaten = 5

Cookies left = Total cookies baked - Cookies eaten
Cookies left = 55 - 5
Cookies left = 50

Since Lani placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 5.

Cookies in each jar = Cookies left / 5
Cookies in each jar = 50 / 5
Cookies in each jar = 10

The final answer is 10."
"To find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals on each type of flower.

The orchids have 5 petals each, and there are 5 orchids. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is 5 * 5 = 25 petals.

The daisies have 10 petals each, and there are 4 daisies. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is 4 * 10 = 40 petals.

To find the difference, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 - 25 = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of indoor plants, we need to calculate one-fourth of 100. This can be done by multiplying 100 by 1/4.

100 * 1/4 = 25

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find the remaining plants:
100 - 25 = 75

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. To find the number of outdoor plants, we multiply 75 by 2/3.

75 * 2/3 = 50

Now, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants:
75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

So, 25% of the plants in Mrs. Smith's garden are flowering plants."
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. 

Let's say the speed of the thingamabob is x. Since a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, we can set up an equation: 
11x = 121 
To solve for x, we divide both sides by 11: 
x = 121 / 11 
x = 11 

So, the thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second. 

Now, we know the whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob. 
So, the speed of the whirligig is 5 times the speed of the thingamabob: 
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11 
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second."
"To find the cost of one carrot, we need to first find the total cost of the salad and yogurt. 

The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3. 

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2. 

So, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day."
"To find Mark's new hourly wage, we need to add the $2 raise to his original wage of $10.

$10 + $2 = $12

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we need to multiply his new wage by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week.

$12 * 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = $480

So, Mark now makes $480 per week."
"To find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns, we need to figure out how many times she mowed each lawn.

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, and she mowed his lawn x times, the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is 6x.

We know that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation:

6x = 80

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6:

x = 80 ÷ 6
x = 13.33

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now, we can find the total amount she earned from mowing lawns:
6x = 6 * 13
6x = 78

To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the amount she earned from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
80 - 78 = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information:

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: $\boxed{74}$"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total amount John earns from renting his car and subtract his car payment.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked per month: 10 hours * 3 hours = 30 hours.

Next, we multiply the total hours worked by the hourly wage: 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

Now, we subtract the car payment from the total earnings: $750 - $500 = $250.

So, John's profit is $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we need to first figure out how many notebooks Joseph had. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Joseph had x notebooks.
Martha had 3x notebooks.

Since Martha had 7 notebooks, we can set up the equation:
3x = 7

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:
x = 7 ÷ 3
x = 2.33

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 2.33 notebooks. To find the difference, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:
7 - 2.33 = 4.67

So, Martha has 4.67 more notebooks than Joseph."
"To find the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we need to calculate Anis' distance first. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance by adding 1/5 of Dijana's distance to Dijana's distance.

Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
= 50 + (1/5 * 50)
= 50 + 10
= 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both of them:
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
= 50 + 60
= 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies among Susan's 6 nephews.

Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies ÷ Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 ÷ 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the difference in pages read by both of them.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. The difference in pages read by Denise and Daniel yesterday is 13 - 10 = 3 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, Denise read 5 more pages than the 13 pages Daniel read yesterday. So, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

The total pages read by both of them is 10 + 13 + 18 = 41 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise. Denise read 41 pages and Daniel read 23 pages. So, Denise read 41 - 23 = 18 more pages than Daniel.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to first determine the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since Calvin has enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls, and there are four adults (Calvin, his wife, and himself), he has 4 bowls of soup. 

Now, we need to subtract the bowls that will be eaten for dinner. There are 4 adults, so 4 bowls will be eaten for dinner. 

4 bowls (total) - 4 bowls (eaten for dinner) = 0 bowls left for lunch.

Since there are 2 children and 0 bowls left, each child will not be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 1 ballpen is $0.50

Total cost = $7.50 + $0.50 = $8

William spent $8 in total."
"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the material required for small and large masks separately.

For small masks, we divide the total number of small masks by the number of masks that can be made with 2 yards of material. So, 20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 5 sets of 2 yards. Since each set uses 2 yards, we multiply 5 sets by 2 yards to get the total yards needed for small masks: 5 * 2 = 10 yards.

For large masks, we divide the total number of large masks by the number of large masks that can be made with 2.25 yards of material. So, 8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards. Since we can't buy a fraction of a yard, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can still calculate the exact amount: 2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards.

To find the total material needed, we add the yards needed for small and large masks: 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets.

Total amount spent = $216
Total number of tickets = 9 movies * 3 tickets/movie = 27 tickets

= $216 ÷ 27
= $8

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day (24 hours) and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Now, subtract these hours from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours

Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day."
"To find the number of blue shoe boxes left, we need to subtract the number of blue shoe boxes used from the total number of blue shoe boxes. 

Number of blue shoe boxes left = Total blue shoe boxes - Number of blue shoe boxes used
= 7 - 3
= 4

To find the number of red shoe boxes left, we need to calculate 1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes and then subtract that from the total number of red shoe boxes.

1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes = 1/3 * 9
= 3

Number of red shoe boxes left = Total red shoe boxes - Number of red shoe boxes used
= 9 - 3

So, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of books Joseph had initially, we need to multiply Sarah's number of books by 2.

9 * 2 = 18

Since Joseph lost 2 books, we subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had.

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to calculate how many marbles he gave away.

Dean gave 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since he has 30 marbles, we can calculate 1/5 of 30 as follows:

1/5 * 30 = 6

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie.

Now, we need to add the 10 marbles he gave to Donald:

6 (given to Jamie) + 10 (given to Donald) = 16

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the total:

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14

Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out Adam's current age and then add 8 to it.

Let's say Adam's current age is 'x'. We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. We can set up an equation based on this information:

Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 * Adam's age 4 years ago
60 - 8 = 2 * (x - 4)
52 = 2x - 8

Now, we can solve for 'x' by adding 8 to both sides of the equation:
52 + 8 = 2x
60 = 2x

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 2:
x = 60 / 2
x = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

The final answer is 38."
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first find the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. 
Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 
So, twice that of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 x 200 = 400 acres. 
Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 
200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"To find out how much money Colby earns in a typical 8-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes and multiply it by the amount he gets paid per package.

He completes 40 packages per hour (50 - 10 = 40). Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, he earns 320 * 0.20 = $64 in a typical 8-hour workday.

The final answer is $64."
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the total time he spends on sudoku. 

A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. So, we multiply 45 minutes by 4 to get the time for the extreme sudoku: 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, we add the time for the normal sudoku and the extreme sudoku: 45 minutes + 180 minutes = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we divide the total time by 30 minutes to find the number of bottles he drinks: 225 minutes / 30 minutes = 7.5.

Since you can't drink half a bottle, we round down to 7 bottles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find the number of yellow balloons, we need to first find the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there were 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Since Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna, the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons is 18 / 3 = 6.

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle."
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total number of miles he drives in 30 days.

Jon drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total number of miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs:
3000 miles ÷ 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To find the total hours worked by Bruce, we need to calculate the hours worked each day.

First, we know Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday. Then, on Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

To find the total hours worked, we add the hours worked each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is 23."
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine had, we need to calculate the total amount they spent.

They bought a cake for $11 and 1 dozen balloons for $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, they bought 12 balloons. So, the cost of the balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.

The total amount spent so far is $11 (cake) + $6 (balloons) = $17.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $17 (cake and balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $31.

Since they started with the same amount of money, we can set up an equation: x + x = 31, where x is the amount of money each girl received.

Combine like terms: 2x = 31

Divide both sides by 2: x = 31 / 2
x = 15.5

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50.

The final answer is: $15.50"
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges.

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we need to subtract 2 from the total.

14 - 2 = 12

"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, so there are 2 * 6 = 12 students playing volleyball. 

The number of students playing soccer is 16 boys and 22 girls, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, let's add the number of students in each group: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The final answer is 56."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops sold and then multiply it by the profit per lollipop.

Number of lollipops sold = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student
= 30 * 10
= 300 lollipops

Profit per lollipop = Selling price - Cost price
= $0.8 - $0.5
= $0.3

Total profit = Number of lollipops sold * Profit per lollipop
= 300 * $0.3
= $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them together.

First, we know Larry has 3 cats. Then, he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Next, he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

After that, he has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

Lastly, he has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person eats per day.

Abby eats 2 slices per day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day.

Total slices eaten per day = Abby's slices + Josh's slices = 2 + 4 = 6 slices per day.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total slices eaten per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is:

10 years - 5 years = 5 years
Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is:

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we need to divide the total number of cups of mint tea by the number of rows.

We know that Lana has 27 cups in total and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea. So, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since she divides the cups into 3 rows, we can divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3 to find the number of cups in each row: 12 ÷ 3 = 4.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to divide the total number of berries he wants to collect (24) by the number of hours he has to collect them (8 hours). Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we can find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours by dividing 8 by 4.

8 ÷ 4 = 2

Since he picks the same number of berries on each trip, we can divide the total number of berries he wants to collect (24) by the number of trips (2) to find the number of berries he can pick per trip.

24 ÷ 2 = 12

The sloth can pick 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours."
"To find the amount of water in the tank, we need to calculate half of the pool's water first. Half of 10000 gallons is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we need to subtract 500 gallons for each day that passes. 

After 6 days, the amount of water in the tank will be:
5000 - (500 * 6) = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. Now he has $134 - $10 = $124 left.

To find out how many movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since it's a Friday, the ticket costs $10.

$124 ÷ $10 = 12.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, he can see 12 movies.

Final answer: 12"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls x 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins x 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs.
So, the total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300

There are 5 days in total (Monday to Friday).
Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 300 / 5
= 60

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

To find the difference, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has.

Total number of toys initially = 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48

Total number of toys now = 62

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys now - Total number of toys initially
= 62 - 48
= 14

The final answer is 14."
"To find Peter's age, we need to solve the problem step by step.

Let's say Peter's age is P, Paul's age is P + 10, and Jean's age is J.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years, so we can write the equation:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:

2P + J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2P + J = 90

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's and Jean's age, so we can write another equation:

P = (P + 10) + J

Simplify:

P = P + J + 10

Subtract P from both sides:

0 = J + 10

Subtract 10 from both sides:

-J = 10

Multiply both sides by -1:

J = -10

Now that we have J, we can find P:

2P + J = 90
2P + (-10) = 90

Add 10 to both sides:

2P = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

P = 50

So, Peter's age is 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so the total number of balloons is 4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons. Maria also had 1 balloon, so the total becomes 8 + 1 = 9 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is 5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons.

Adding the initial 9 balloons to the additional 15 balloons, the total number of balloons is 9 + 15 = 24 balloons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find the total number of boxes, we need to add the boxes donated by the people and the boxes they already own.

Donated boxes: 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
Existing boxes: 10 boxes
Total boxes: 50 + 10 = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the number of tables needed.

Number of tables needed: 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

Since they already have 15 tables, we need to subtract the existing tables from the total tables needed to find the new tables required.

New tables needed: 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance spat by Zoey, multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 
40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet

To find the total distance spat by Sydney, multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 
35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet

To find the total distance spat by both, add the distances spat by Zoey and Sydney: 
400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, divide the total distance by 2 (since there are 2 people): 
820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total amount of money each machine makes in a month.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine makes in a month. We know that the Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour. There are 24 hours in a day and 30 days in a month.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
Widgets per hour: 60
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
Widgets per hour: 45
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money each machine makes in a month. Each widget sells for $6.

Total money from Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 * $6 = $259,200
Total money from WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 * $6 = $194,400

To find the difference in the total amount of money Fern will make from the two machines, we subtract the total money from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the total money from the Widgeteer 3000:
$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the cost of the extended stay.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.

Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. 

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 x 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the extended stay is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the extended stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Cameron would save 250 pesos.

Final answer: 250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we need to calculate the amount of hay each animal needs and then add them together.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. 
Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, so each sheep needs 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

There are 15 goats, so the total amount of hay needed for goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.
There are 12 sheep, so the total amount of hay needed for sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay needed is 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much John has left after buying the pencils, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils from his total earnings.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends 5 * 10 = 50 dollars.

Now, he has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars left.

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the amount he has left by 25.

100 ÷ 25 = 4

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig, we need to multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word. 

Number of words spelled by Craig = 20
Number of letters in each word = 15

Total number of letters spelled by Craig = 20 * 15
Total number of letters spelled by Craig = 300

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, we add 50 to Craig's total:
Total number of letters spelled by Craig's brother = 300 + 50
Total number of letters spelled by Craig's brother = 350

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 350."

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to calculate the total number of bottles given to the students and subtract that from the total number of bottles the teacher can get.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles the teacher can get is:
9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can get:
900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the fixed charge and the cost of parts.

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

Total fixed charge = $40

Total cost of parts = $60

Total cost = Labor cost + Total fixed charge + Total cost of parts
Total cost = $78.75 + $40 + $60
Total cost = $178.75

"To find out how much James spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is the number of CDs multiplied by the price per CD. 

Total cost of CDs = 10 * $15
Total cost of CDs = $150

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 

Discount amount = Total cost of CDs * Discount percentage
Discount amount = $150 * 0.4
Discount amount = $60

Now, James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling them is:

Total amount from selling CDs = Number of CDs sold * Price per CD
Total amount from selling CDs = 5 * $40
Total amount from selling CDs = $200

To find out how much James was out, we subtract the total amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost of the CDs.

Amount James was out = Total cost of CDs - Total amount from selling CDs
Amount James was out = $150 - $200
Amount James was out = -$50

Since James was out $50, he actually lost $50.

Final answer: $50"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the time James spends swimming the first 60% of the distance.
Distance = 20 miles
Speed = 2 miles per hour
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 20 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 10 hours

Step 2: Calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour.
Distance = 20 miles * 0.6
Distance = 12 miles

Step 3: Calculate the time James spends swimming 12 miles at 2 miles per hour.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

Step 4: Calculate the time James spends resting on the island.
Rest time = Swimming time
Rest time = 6 hours

Step 5: Calculate the distance James swims at half the speed (1 mile per hour).
Distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
Distance = 8 miles

Step 6: Calculate the time James spends swimming 8 miles at 1 mile per hour.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Step 7: Calculate the total time James spends on the entire journey.
Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Swimming time
Total time = 6 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 20 hours

"To find the total commission, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission for the New York Times. Since Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy, we multiply the number of copies (6) by 10% (or 0.1) and then by the cost of each copy ($5).

Commission for the New York Times = 6 * 0.1 * 5 = $3

Next, let's calculate the commission for the Wall Street Journal. Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy, so we multiply the number of copies (10) by 8% (or 0.08) and then by the cost of each copy ($15).

Commission for the Wall Street Journal = 10 * 0.08 * 15 = $12

"To find Leo's age, we need to use the information given. We know Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. So, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can set up an equation: Marcus's age = 0.5 * Leo's age. We know Marcus's age is 21, so we can plug that in: 21 = 0.5 * Leo's age.

To find Leo's age, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.5: Leo's age = 21 / 0.5 = 42.

The answer is 42."
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to figure out how many points Dinar scored first. Let's say Dinar scored x points. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points.

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points. We also know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + ((x + 10) - 20) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 15

So, Dinar scored 15 points.

Now, we can find out how many points Azibo scored:

Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points
= (15 + 10) - 20
= 25 - 20
= 5

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

There are 60 minutes in an hour. From 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM is 4 hours, which is 4 x 60 = 240 minutes.
From 12:00 PM to 11:00 PM is 11 hours, which is 11 x 60 = 660 minutes.

Total minutes = 240 + 660 = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we need to divide the total minutes by 15.

Total reports = 900 / 15 = 60

The final answer is 60."

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. 

8 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 480 minutes

She woke up 5 minutes early, so we subtract 5 minutes from the total minutes she slept:
480 - 5 = 475 minutes

However, she also woke up from 2:15 to 2:38 am, which is 23 minutes. We need to add these minutes to the total:

"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of beds that are not occupied.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of them are occupied. To find the number of occupied beds, we can multiply 1000 by 1/5.

1000 x 1/5 = 200 beds

So, there are 200 occupied beds. To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity.

1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Now, we need to calculate the number of days in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so:

2 weeks = 2 x 7 = 14 days

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 14 days is:

50 x 14 = 700 patients

The number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:
800 - 700 = 100 beds

"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many emails are not work emails. We know she sends 7 work emails a day. So, the number of non-work emails is:

Non-work emails = Total emails - Work emails
Non-work emails = 16 - 7
Non-work emails = 9

Now, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are to her boyfriend. We know that 2/3 of the non-work emails are to family, so the remaining 1/3 must be to her boyfriend. To find 1/3 of 9, we can multiply 9 by 1/3.

Emails to boyfriend = (1/3) * 9
Emails to boyfriend = 3

So, Robyn sends 3 emails to her boyfriend per day.

"To find the total number of balls, we need to figure out how many balls each person carried. We know that Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason. Since Jason carried 2 balls, we can find out how many balls Jeffrey carried by dividing Jason's balls by 2.

Jeffrey's balls = Jason's balls / 2
Jeffrey's balls = 2 / 2
Jeffrey's balls = 1

Now that we know Jeffrey carried 1 ball, we can find out how many balls Jordan carried by multiplying Jeffrey's balls by 2.

Jordan's balls = 2 * Jeffrey's balls
Jordan's balls = 2 * 1
Jordan's balls = 2

The total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey.

Total balls = Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls
Total balls = 2 + 2 + 1
Total balls = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day and then subtract that from the total number of holes on the fourth day.

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 6 holes on the third day (since 2 holes were filled in). So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, which means the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is 4 * 29 = 116 holes.

To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day from the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day: 116 - 29 = 87 holes.

The final answer is: 87"
"To find the total number of corn chips, we need to figure out how many corn chips Collins got. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we add the corn chips of all three: 70 (Amora) + 70 (Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = 225.

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

The cost of supplies is $400. To find 50% of this amount, we multiply $400 by 0.5.

50% of $400 = 0.5 x $400 = $200

Now, we add the 50% of the cost of supplies to the cost of supplies.

Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of the cost of supplies
= $400 + $200
= $600

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the total number of Pokémon caught is 339. We also know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught.

Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We can write the following equations:

1. A + S + X = 339
2. X = S + 5
3. S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the value of X from equation 2 into equation 1:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the value of S from equation 3 into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is 147."
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

Total minutes per episode = 20
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the total minutes per episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the first direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the second direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the third direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, the net distance traveled south is:
Net Distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
Net Distance = 264 miles

The bird traveled a total of 264 miles south, so the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 264 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{264}$"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to add the brownies she made for herself, the ones she received at the office party, and the ones her friends brought to her home.

She made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can write this as 12 brownies.

She received 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies at the office party. To find 1/2 of 12, we multiply 12 by 1/2, which is the same as dividing 12 by 2. So, 12 ÷ 2 = 6.

Her friends brought 4 dozen (48) brownies to her home. Again, 1 dozen is equal to 12, so we can write this as 48 brownies.

Now, let's add the brownies together: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten. To find 1 1/2 of 12, we can multiply 12 by 1.5, which is the same as multiplying 12 by 3/2. So, 12 × 3/2 = 18.

Now, let's subtract the brownies eaten from the total: 66 - 18 = 48.

Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his age is 2 x 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of Nani (8), his brother (16), and his sister (6). 
The total age of the family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for each type of string:

- Time for synthetic gut: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
- Time for polyester string: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
- Time for hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Now, let's add the times together: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

"To find the total cost of the phones, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The cost of the first two phones is 2 x $600 = $1200.

The cost of the remaining phones (3 phones) is 3 x $300 (half of $600) = $900.

The total cost is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team and Carlton's team.

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, we can represent this as an equation: 

Let C = number of players in Carlton's team
Let Z = number of players in Zeke's team

We know that Z = C + 7

We also know that C = 13

Now, we can substitute the value of C into the equation for Z: 
Z = 13 + 7
Z = 20

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 
Total players = C + Z
Total players = 13 + 20
Total players = 33

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence.

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to follow these steps:

First, we calculate the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially: 12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges.

Then, we calculate the number of oranges she gave to her mom and sister: 2 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 40 oranges.

Next, we calculate the number of oranges she kept: 1/4 of 240 oranges = 60 oranges.

Now, we subtract the oranges she kept and gave away from the total: 240 - 40 - 60 = 140 oranges.

Since she sold the rest, the number of oranges she sold is 140 oranges.

The final answer is 140."
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in the USA and then add 4 to it.

The number of states in the USA is 50.

Half of 50 is 25. 
India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India: 
50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the books and subtract the amount he has saved.

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, we subtract this from the total cost:

$39 - $14 = $25

Now, we need to divide the amount needed ($25) by Tyler's hourly wage ($5) to find the number of hours he needs to work:

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we need to first figure out how many cherries Jerry has. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard. So, we can find Richard's cherries by subtracting 10 from Robert's cherries.

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now, we can find Jerry's cherries by subtracting Robert's and Richard's cherries from the total number of cherries (60).

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Robert's cherries - Richard's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 30 - 20
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries.

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To find out how much Sunny earned from selling gingerbread and apple pie, we need to calculate the total earnings for each day and then add them together.

First, let's find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.

On Sunday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Saturday, so he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- 6 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $90

Total earnings for two days: $60 + $90 + $90 = $240

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now. We can represent his current age as E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. We can write this as an equation: 24 = D/2, where D is the age of his dad. To solve for D, we can multiply both sides by 2, which gives us D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. We can write this as another equation: 24 = 2B, where B is the age of his brother. To solve for B, we can divide both sides by 2, which gives us B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12. The sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne had, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads: 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.

Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day.

Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday. Then, he caught 4 times that amount on Friday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, we add up the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders/band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the average size of the shoes, we need to add the sizes of Charlie's and Sophie's boots and divide by 2.

Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots. So, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding the sizes together and dividing by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes is 15."
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so we multiply 111 feet by 12 inches to get 1332 inches.

Now, we need to divide 1332 inches by the width of each plant (12 inches) and the space between them (1.5 feet, which is 18 inches). So, we divide 1332 by (12 + 18) to get 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 27 * 6 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. So, we can multiply 18 by 1/2 to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day.

18 * 1/2 = 9

Now, we multiply 9 pretzels by 7 to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week.

9 * 7 = 63

Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias is 5 baskets times 3 petunias per basket, times $3.00 per petunia. This can be calculated as 5 x 3 x $3.00.

The cost of sweet potato vines is 5 baskets times 2 vines per basket, times $2.50 per vine. This can be calculated as 5 x 2 x $2.50.

Let's calculate the cost of petunias: 5 x 3 x $3.00 = $45.00

Let's calculate the cost of sweet potato vines: 5 x 2 x $2.50 = $25.00

The total cost is the sum of the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside for shoes each month and then divide that by the cost of a pair of shoes.

Jessica makes $2,000 a month and sets aside 25% of that amount. To find 25% of $2,000, we multiply $2,000 by 0.25.

$2,000 * 0.25 = $500

Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000, we can divide the amount she sets aside by the cost of a pair to find out how many pairs she can buy in a month.

$500 ÷ $1,000 = 0.5 pairs per month

There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply the number of pairs she can buy in a month by 12 to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year.

0.5 pairs/month * 12 months = 6 pairs per year

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes for each task separately.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to find the time:

Time to peel 90 shrimp = 90 ÷ 6 = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Since Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to find the time:

Time to cook 90 shrimp = 90 ÷ 30 = 3 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and cook the shrimp to find the total time:

Total time = Time to peel + Time to cook
= 15 minutes + 3 minutes
= 18 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 18 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

Final answer: 18"
"To find out how many degrees lower the final temperature is compared to the starting temperature, we need to calculate the total cooling effect and the warming effect.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. It ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room 3 x 2 = 6 degrees. Then, it ran on high for 4 hours, cooling the room an additional 4 x 3 = 12 degrees. The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

The room will warm up at 2 degrees per hour with no air conditioner running. Since the air conditioner was off for 2 hours, the room warmed up 2 x 2 = 4 degrees.

The final temperature is the starting temperature minus the total cooling effect plus the warming effect: Final temperature = Starting temperature - 18 + 4 = Starting temperature - 14.

Since we don't know the starting temperature, we can represent the final temperature as a difference from the starting temperature. The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time. So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we need to find out how many years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet. Let's call this number x. We can set up the equation: x + 30 = 90.

Solving for x, we get x = 60 years.

Now, we know that the comet orbits the sun 4/5 of the time, so it will take 4/5 of the total time for the comet to return. The total time for the comet to return is 75 years, so the time for the comet to return is 4/5 * 75 = 60 years.

Since Bill saw the comet 60 years after his dad, and the comet returns every 75 years, we can find the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet by subtracting 60 from 75, which is 15 years.

Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, and 15 years have passed since then, we can find Bill's age when his dad saw the comet by adding 15 to 30, which is 45 years.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

Buford writes 1 check for the electric bill and 1 check for the gas bill each month, so that's 2 checks per month for these bills. He also writes 2 checks to the church each month. 

So, the total number of checks per month is: 2 (electric and gas) + 2 (church) = 4 checks

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the total number of checks per month by 12: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

The final answer is 48."
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane makes 3/4 of its flights to Greece, so it makes 3/4 * 88 = 66 flights to Greece.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the first plane makes 88 - 66 = 22 flights to France and Germany.

Since the flights to France and Germany are split equally, the first plane makes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France.

The answer is 11."
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 x $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam bought the trousers for $30. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

$30 - $18 = $12

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

We know the total age of the children is 20. We also know Akbar's age is 3 and Alessandro's age is 4. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.

The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

Since Helene is twice the average age, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age: W = 20 - 3 - 4 - 10 = 3.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, his lawyer will contribute 3 * $2000 = $6000.

However, Walter's friend is going to give him $200. This amount will be subtracted from the total amount collected, so the final amount Walter's lawyer will contribute is $6000 - $200 = $5800.

The final answer is: $5800"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

Total number of cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies
Half of the cookies = 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church.

Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

The final answer is 50."
"To divide the watermelon, we need to find out how many slices each adult gets. Let's say the number of slices for the kids is x. Since each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, the number of slices for the adults is 2x.

We know that the total number of slices is 6 (2 adults + 4 kids). So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 6

Combine like terms: 3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 2x = 4.

Since each slice is equal in size, we can find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets by dividing the number of slices for the adults (4) by the total number of slices (6) and multiplying by 100:

(4/6) * 100 = 66.67%

So, each adult gets approximately 66.67% of the watermelon.

The final answer is 66.67."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes ÷ 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up the time it takes to make the cake.

Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes, baking the cake takes 30 minutes, cooling the cake takes 2 hours (or 120 minutes), and frosting the cake takes 10 minutes. 

We can add these times together: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours.

Now, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time to find the latest start time. If Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to go back 3 hours from 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan can start making the cake at 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: 2:00 pm"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars sold by the total number of boxes sold.

Let's do the math:

Total chocolate bars sold = 64
Total boxes sold = 8

Number of chocolate bars in a box = Total chocolate bars sold ÷ Total boxes sold
= 64 ÷ 8
= 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

Final answer: 8"
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25 * 3 days = $75. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students. So, the cost of students' lessons per week is $1.50 * 3 sessions * 10 students = $45. In a month, this would be $45 * 4 = $180.

The total cost of renting the studio and students' lessons per month is $300 (renting) + $180 (students' lessons) = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to first find out how many chocolate bars are in each box.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide 64 by 4. This can be written as 64 ÷ 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide 56 by 7. This can be written as 56 ÷ 7 = 8.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter and Martha. To do this, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter. This can be written as 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines:
50 (initial population) + 1440 (new porcupines) = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool.

Volume = Length x Width x Depth
Volume = 14 x 25 x 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll do that next.

Total gallons = Volume x 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 x 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Total gallons x Cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 x 0.10
Cost = $826

The cost to fill the pool is $826."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of blue sticks and yellow sticks first.

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, we can find the number of blue sticks by adding 5 to the number of red sticks.

Number of blue sticks = 9 (red) + 5 = 14

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so we subtract 3 from the number of blue sticks.

Number of yellow sticks = 14 (blue) - 3 = 11

Now, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks to find the total number of sticks.

Total number of sticks = 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

The final answer is 34."
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we need to multiply his speed (55 miles per hour) by the time he traveled (4 hours). This can be calculated as:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours
Distance = 220 miles

Next, we need to find the distance traveled by Shandy. We multiply her speed (45 miles per hour) by the time she traveled (10 hours):

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours
Distance = 450 miles

Now, we need to find the difference in distance traveled between Shandy and Matteo. To do this, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance:

Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance
Difference = 450 miles - 220 miles
Difference = 230 miles

The difference in distance traveled is 230 miles."
"To find the total number of female students, we need to break down the information given:

- Total students: 3000
- Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500
- One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16
- Remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500
- One-half of the students under 16 are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16

Now, let's find the number of female students over 16 and under 16:
- Female students over 16: 1500 - 375 = 1125
- Female students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750

Total female students: 1125 + 750 = 1875

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. We know that Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. 

We also know that Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how much water is left in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped over the two days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. So, the total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining amount of water is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:

x - (9% * 5) = x - 45%

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:

x - 45% - (7% * 3) = x - 45% - 21%
x - 66% = 28%

To find the value of x, we can add 66% to both sides:

x = 28% + 66%
x = 94%

So, the initial charge of the power bank was 94%.

The final answer is: 94"
"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the cost of the car.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 ÷ $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours ÷ 40 hours/week = 2 weeks

Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

He bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He bought 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total amount spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Jamaar has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25, but since he can't spend a negative amount, this means he actually spent more than he has. However, we can still calculate how many plums he can buy with the money he has left.

Since he has $0.25 left, he can buy 1 plum at $0.25.

Final answer: 1"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we need to first find out how many pieces were given away. 

There are 15 packs in total, and Anne kept 2 packs. So, the number of packs given away is 15 - 2 = 13.

Each pack has 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces given away is 13 * 60 = 780.

Since the sweets were given to 10 friends equally, we divide the total number of pieces given away by 10:

780 ÷ 10 = 78

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
The price increase is 5% of the original price, which is 0.05 * $120 = $6. 
The new price is $120 + $6 = $126.

Year 2: 
The price increase is 5% of $126, which is 0.05 * $126 = $6.30. 
The new price is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

Year 3: 
The price increase is 5% of $132.30, which is 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615. 
The new price is $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

Final answer: $139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album.

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the number of selfies.

3 x 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the number of portraits.

2 x 9 = 18

The total number of portraits and selfies is 27 + 18 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the total time James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages. 

Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes him to read 1 page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

10 minutes ÷ 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by the total number of pages he reads:

3.33 minutes per page × 18 pages = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to follow the steps below:

The hotel initially had 100 guests. Then, 24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76. Next, 15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in. The number of guests remaining is 61 + 30 = 91. Finally, 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas:
4 + 6 + 12 = 22

John has 22 bananas."
"To find the number of easy questions, we need to calculate 40% of 60. 
40% of 60 is 0.4 * 60 = 24.

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we subtract the easy questions from the total:
60 - 24 = 36

Now, we divide the remaining questions by 2:
36 / 2 = 18

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 24 * 0.75 = 18.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 18 * 0.5 = 9.

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we add the points from easy and average/difficult questions:
18 + 9 = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Let's say the price of a small stuffed animal is x. Then, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x.

We also know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. This means 4 = x, so x = 4.

Now, let's say Teresa sold 's' number of large stuffed animals and '2s' number of small stuffed animals. The total amount earned from the sales is $120, so we can set up the equation: 12s + 4(2s) = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12s + 8s = 120
Combining like terms, we get: 20s = 120
Dividing both sides by 20, we get: s = 6

Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2s = 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week, we need to multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

Total sandwiches eaten per day = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11

Total sandwiches eaten in a week = 11 * 7 = 77

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 x $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 x $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them a total of 2 x $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the twins found and the number of eggs that were not found from the total number of eggs.

Total eggs = 100
Eggs found by twins = 30
Eggs not found = 10

Eggs found by friends = Total eggs - Eggs found by twins - Eggs not found
= 100 - 30 - 10
= 60

The friends found 60 eggs."
"To find the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we need to calculate the amount of ore mined per day and then multiply it by 30.

We know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day. With a steel pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Since there are 40 dwarves, the total amount of ore mined per day with steel pickaxes is 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

Now, we multiply this by 30 days to get the total amount of ore mined in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to figure out the price per sandwich. We know that the first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, and the second package has 4 sandwiches for $6. 

We can find the price per sandwich by dividing the price by the number of sandwiches. For the first package, the price per sandwich is $3 ÷ 2 = $1.50. Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages.

Now, we can multiply the price per sandwich by 8 to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches. $1.50 × 8 = $12.

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

Final answer: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate 10% of the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

The remaining amount owed is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

To find 10% of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 0.10.

Monthly payment = 0.10 x $2000
Monthly payment = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to follow the steps below:

First, we calculate the number of red balloons that burst: 
40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.

Next, we calculate the number of red balloons remaining:
25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Then, we calculate the number of yellow balloons released:
Half of 12 yellow balloons = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released.

After that, we calculate the number of yellow balloons remaining:
12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

We also need to add the blue balloons that Sally found:
8 blue balloons were caught in a tree, and she added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. 
75% of 8 blue balloons = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.

Finally, we calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school:
15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 27 balloons.

The final answer is 27."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the following scenarios:

Let's break it down:

- The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
- The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 40% chance of getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
- The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

Now, we add up the probabilities of these scenarios: 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.8

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.8 * 100 = 80%

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 80%.

Final answer: $\boxed{80\%}$"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would get, we need to subtract the total number of seats taken by graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 ÷ 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, we can calculate the number of medium beans as follows:

Medium beans = 2 * Large beans
Medium beans = 2 * 75
Medium beans = 150

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we can divide the number of medium beans by 3:

Small beans = Medium beans / 3
Small beans = 150 / 3
Small beans = 50

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small jelly beans."
"To calculate Melissa's hourly wage after expenses, we need to find out how much she earns per day and then divide it by the number of hours she works.

Melissa earns $15 per day and spends $3 on parking. So, her daily income after expenses is $15 - $3 = $12.

She works for 6 hours a day for 3 days. To find her total income, we multiply her daily income by the number of days: $12 * 3 = $36.

Now, we divide her total income by the total number of hours she works: $36 ÷ 18 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

So, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we can divide the width of the driveway by 3:

24 feet ÷ 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, the total time it will take him to set off all the soda fountains is:

7 moves × 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains."
"To find the total number of packs, we need to multiply the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes.

Number of apples in one box = 40
Number of boxes = 2

Total number of apples = 40 * 2 = 80

Since each pack has 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs.

Number of packs = 80 ÷ 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

Final answer: 10"
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

The cost of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she bought 2 pounds. So, the total cost of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.

The cost of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds. So, the total cost of Mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost of cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10

So, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

The final answer is: $10"
"To figure out how long it would take Jim to earn the money he lost from not working and pay off his loans, we need to add the amount of money he lost to the amount of his loans.

The amount of money he lost is 4 years * $25,000 = $100,000. The amount of his loans is 4 years * $50,000 = $200,000. So, the total amount he needs to earn is $100,000 + $200,000 = $300,000.

Now, we need to divide the total amount by his new income, which is $75,000. 

$300,000 ÷ $75,000 = 4 years.

The answer is 4."
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the comforter. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the comforter. Since the comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of the comforter will be:
- Length: 6 + 2 = 8 feet
- Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of the comforter:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 8 x 10
Area = 80 square feet

Since the comforter is made of two pieces, we need to multiply the area by 2:
Total fabric needed = 2 x 80
Total fabric needed = 160 square feet

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery:
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85
17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery:
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204
5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person. To multiply these numbers, we multiply the numbers together: 10 * 6.50 = $65.

The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person. To multiply these numbers, we multiply the numbers together: 6 * 6 = $36.

The total amount Molly will pay is $65 + $36. To add these numbers, we can use a calculator or add them together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The final answer is: $101"
"To find the average amount lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.
In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
So, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11.
In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Total amount lost = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

Average amount lost = Total amount lost / Number of races
= $21.5 / 3
= $7.17

The final answer is $7.17."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

There are 26 countries in South America, and each country has 5 cities with 1000 people living in each city. 

Total population = Number of countries * Number of cities per country * Population per city
Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000
Total population = 130,000

The final answer is: 130,000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height is 4 feet 3 inches. We can convert this to just inches by multiplying the feet by 12 and adding the inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot + 3 inches = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

Cole's new height is 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

Now, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height to find the difference:
52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find the amount the first person took, we need to divide the total amount ($1920) by 3.

Let's say the first person took x dollars. The second person took x + 80 dollars, and the third person took 2(x + 80) dollars.

We can write an equation to represent the situation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 1760 ÷ 3
x = 586.67

So the first person took $586.67.

The final answer is: $586.67"
"To find the total hours worked by the team, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team:
3 weeks = 3 * 7 days = 21 days
3/8 of a day = 21 * 3/8 = 7.875 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply 7.875 days by 24 hours:
7.875 * 24 = 189 hours

Now, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters (4):
189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total. Let's say the number of balls he retrieved in the second set is x. Since he retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls he retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls he retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We can write an equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

So, Rory retrieved 10 balls in the first set.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

The car depreciates by 21% each year. We can use the formula for depreciation: 

Price = Original Price * (1 - Depreciation Rate)

For 2008: 
Price = $20,000 * (1 - 0.21) 
Price = $20,000 * 0.79 
Price = $15,800

For 2009: 
Price = $15,800 * (1 - 0.21) 
Price = $15,800 * 0.79 
Price = $12,493.20

For 2010: 
Price = $12,493.20 * (1 - 0.21) 
Price = $12,493.20 * 0.79 
Price = $9,876.27

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,876.27."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to first find the number of books written in English and German.

Number of English books = 50 * 0.5 = 25
Number of German books = 50 * 0.1 = 5

Total number of English and German books = 25 + 5 = 30

Since the total number of books is 50, the number of Spanish books is:
50 - 30 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven (325 kilometers) from the total distance (1955 kilometers).

Let's do the math:

1955 - 325 = 1630

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

Final answer: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to multiply the number of cups she drinks per day by the number of days.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups of water.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide 240 cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups ÷ 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, so the total becomes 120 + 20 = 140.
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people board the train. So, the total becomes 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train, so the total becomes 190 - 80 = 110.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

Final answer: 110"
"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Alison bought a tank top for $10. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24. She also bought a package of $8 athletic socks, but she had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost of the tiles, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required. 

Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. 

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet. 

To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area by the area of each tile: 
200 square feet ÷ 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile to find the total cost:
200 tiles × $12 per tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 = 0.6 x $120 = $72

The increased cost is $72. To find the total cost, we add the increased cost to the normal cost:

$120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this amount for a month, we need to multiply it by 12 to find the yearly cost:

$192 x 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find the total number of loads, we need to calculate the number of loads for each type of bed and then add them together.

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. He does laundry every week. His machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time. 

First, let's find out how many loads he does for the twin beds. Since he has 4 twin beds, he needs 4 / 2 = 2 loads of twin sheets per week.

For the king bed, he needs 1 load of king sheets per week.

So, the total number of loads per week is 2 (twin loads) + 1 (king load) = 3 loads.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by 52 to find the total number of loads per year: 3 * 52 = 156 loads.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday separately.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. 
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

Total movies watched on Saturday in 4 weeks = 4 movies/week * 4 weeks = 16 movies
Total movies watched on Sunday in 4 weeks = 2 movies/week * 4 weeks = 8 movies

Total movies watched in 4 weeks = 16 + 8 = 24 movies

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find the total number of stickers Leo has, we need to add the stickers he had two years ago, last year, and this year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers. This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, we add the stickers from the three years: 100 + 150 + 100 = 350 stickers.

The total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is 350."
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount fed per day (60 grams).

720 ÷ 60 = 12

The cat food will last 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many slices each person ate and then add them up.

We know Becky ate 10 slices. Since she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up an equation to find out how many slices Jake ate. Let's call the number of slices Jake ate ""x"". We can write the equation as:

10 = x + 3

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

x = 10 - 3
x = 7

Now that we know Jake ate 7 slices, we can find out how many slices Silvia ate. Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can multiply Jake's slices by 2:

Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now that we know how many slices each person ate, we can find the total number of slices they ate:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it took for Betsy to make her part of the meal. Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:

Betsy's part = x + 18
= 40 + 18
= 58

The final answer is 58."
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The doctor charges $200 for the cast. Then, there's the visit, which costs $300 per hour. Since the visit is 30 minutes, we need to convert the time to hours. 30 minutes is 0.5 hours. So, the visit costs $300 * 0.5 = $150.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the painkillers. The doctor gives 30 pills, and each pill costs $4. So, the total cost of the painkillers is 30 * $4 = $120.

Lastly, the doctor charges $6 per hour for parking, and the visit is for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add the costs together: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to calculate the number of emails that require a response. 

First, we find 20% of 80 emails, which is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response. 

The number of emails that require a response is 80 - 16 = 64.

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

The final answer is 320."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to add the number of classes that visited each day.

Let's break it down:

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: 2 times as many as Monday, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes
- Wednesday: 3 times as many as Monday, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's add them up: 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247 classes

The total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."

"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.7. This gives us 20 * 0.7 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club. The glee club ordered 20 pizzas, so the football team ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. To find 80% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.8. This gives us 40 * 0.8 = 32 pizzas.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = $7.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = $21.

The total cost of postage is $7 + $21 = $28.

The final answer is: $28"
"To find the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we need to follow the steps:

Sidney ordered 7 sub sandwiches initially. Then, Mark ate 4 of them, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches. After that, Sidney ordered 3 more sub sandwiches, making the total number of sub sandwiches 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6.

Since each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, and each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total amount of fertiliser is:
20 trucks * 20 tons = 400 tons

Now, we are told that a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures and couldn't deliver the fertiliser. To find the number of trucks that couldn't deliver, we calculate:
1/4 * 20 trucks = 5 trucks

Since 5 trucks couldn't deliver, the amount of fertiliser they couldn't deliver is:
5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons

To find the amount of fertiliser that was delivered, we subtract the amount that couldn't be delivered from the total amount:
400 tons - 100 tons = 300 tons

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs and then apply the discount.

Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen. So, he needs 6 x 1 = 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds.

To find the total cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) into groups of 2 pounds. 

6 pounds / 2 pounds per group = 3 groups

Since each group costs 1.5 pounds, the total cost will be:
3 groups x 1.5 pounds per group = 4.5 pounds

Since the butter costs $4.00 a pound, the total cost will be:
4.5 pounds x $4.00 per pound = $18.00

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of guests first. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. However, 4 people said they couldn't come.

Total number of guests = 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. We need to find the number of additional guests.

Additional guests = Total number of guests - 20
= 41 - 20
= 21

Cost for additional guests = 21 * $6
= $126

Total cost = $125 + $126
= $251

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially, we need to add the amount of money they each had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is $60 + $60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. To find 1/4 of $60, we can multiply 60 by 1/4. 
60 * 1/4 = 60/4 = 15

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. To find 1/3 of $60, we can multiply 60 by 1/3. 
60 * 1/3 = 60/3 = 20

The total amount of money they spent is 15 + 20 = 35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$120 - $35 = $85

The two of them have $85 left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first find out how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 3 monkeys, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day is:
10 + 14 = 24 bananas

The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas, which is:
315 - 24 = 291 bananas

Since there are 7 days in a week, the third monkey eats:
291 / 7 = 41.57 bananas per day.

Since you can't eat a fraction of a banana, we round down to 41 bananas per day.

The final answer is 41."
"To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the number of pieces he placed in the first half of the puzzle and the number of pieces he placed in the second puzzle.

Since Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, he placed 250 pieces.

In the second puzzle, he finished 500 pieces.

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

The answer is 750."
"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then subtract that from the amount of money she has.

The cost of 15 roses is $30. Since a dozen roses cost $15, we can also calculate the cost of 15 roses as follows:
15 roses / 12 = 1.25 dozen
1.25 dozen * $15 per dozen = $18.75

Since Jenny doesn't have enough money to pay for the roses, we need to find out how much change she will get. To do this, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount of money she has:

"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time between each train's arrival and departure.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time between the first train's arrival and departure is 20 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the time between the second train's arrival and departure is 5 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes after the second train's arrival. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so the time between the third train's arrival and departure is 0 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 20 minutes after the third train's arrival. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:

Waiting time = Time waiting for the first train + Time waiting for the second train + Time waiting for the third train + Time waiting for the fourth train
= 20 + 30 + 60 + 20
= 130 minutes

"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12).

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the original price of the watch, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so the sale price is 0.75 times the original price. Let's call the original price ""x"". We can set up the equation: 0.75x = 2000. To find x, we divide both sides by 0.75, which gives us x = 2000 / 0.75 = 2666.67.

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 times the price he bought it. So, the sale price is 1.2 * 2666.67 = 3200.

The original price was 2666.67, and the sale price was 3200. The discount is 3200 - 2666.67 = 533.33.

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100: (533.33 / 2666.67) * 100 = 20%.

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of jellyfish created per hour by one spring and then multiply it by the number of springs and the number of hours.

Since a new jellyfish is created every second, we can assume that the rate of jellyfish creation is 1 jellyfish per second.

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame.

So, the number of jellyfish created per hour by one spring is 1 jellyfish/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 jellyfish/hour.

Now, if 5 springs are working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created per hour is 5 * 3600 jellyfish/hour = 18,000 jellyfish/hour.

In 4 hours, the total number of jellyfish created is 18,000 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72,000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the time it took him to walk to the store and then back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took him to walk to the store. Since he walked halfway, that's 2 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 0.5 hours

Since he walked back home, the total distance is 2 miles (to the store) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

The total time it took James to reach the store is 0.5 hours (to the store) + 1 hour (back home) = 1.5 hours.

"To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches individually and then compare it to the cost of buying 10 bunches.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches individually. Since each banana costs $0.80, we multiply the number of bananas in a bunch (4) by the cost per banana:

4 bananas/bunch * $0.80/banana = $3.20/bunch

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches:

10 bunches * $3.20/bunch = $32.00

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

$32.00 - $8.00 = $24.00

The final answer is: $24.00"
"To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we need to divide the total length of the fence (100 feet) by 2, since they are splitting it equally. However, since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, we can set up an equation: 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Then, Harry gets x + 60 feet. Since the total length of the fence is 100 feet, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the total growth in 13 years, we need to multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years.

"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold:
Number of Trekking bikes = Total bikes * 0.5
= 300 * 0.5
= 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold:
Number of BMX bikes = Total bikes * 0.15
= 300 * 0.15
= 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold:
Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - (Number of Trekking bikes + Number of BMX bikes)
= 300 - (150 + 45)
= 300 - 195
= 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes * Price of Trekking bike
= 150 * 450
= $67,500

Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes * Price of BMX bike
= 45 * 250
= $11,250

Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes * Price of MTB bike
= 105 * 500
= $52,500

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

Therefore, 12 bales of hay are left in the field."
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per week.

He attends 5 classes per day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes he spends in class per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Now, we need to add the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days. 

1/16 of 1000 minutes is 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

So, the total minutes he spends on learning per week is 1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60. 

1062.5 / 60 = 17.6875 hours.

The final answer is: 17.6875"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 x 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 x 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball will bounce to 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is 2/3 x 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball will go 32 feet on its second bounce."
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert the first child's height to inches by multiplying 6 by 12. This gives us 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so we add 2 inches to the first child's height: 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 inches from the second child's height: 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 inches to the third child's height: 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so the velociraptors must have eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate 'x'. Then, the velociraptors ate x/2 kilograms.

Since the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, we can set up the equation: x/2 = 270

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 540

Now, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, so the T-Rex ate 540/2 = 270 kilograms.

To find the initial amount, we add the amount the T-Rex ate to the amount left after the T-Rex ate: 540 + 270 = 810

So, there were 810 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

Final answer: 810"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of the friend getting a shaken can.

There are 3 shaken sodas out of the 8 remaining sodas. The friend can choose from these 8 sodas. The probability of the friend getting a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans, which is 3/8.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(3/8) * 100 = 37.5%

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 37.5%.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled:
30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them:

"To find out how many people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per day.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since you can't take a fraction of a day off, we'll round down to 6 days.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help (25) by the number of people he can help per day (6):

   Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
   Martha's age = 24 - 4
   Martha's age = 20

2. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.
   Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
   Jeff's age = 20 + 10
   Jeff's age = 30

So, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed.

For the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes
For the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest waterslide.

Final answer: 2"
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this amount of time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5:
1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first figure out how many miles Micah ran. We know that Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. Since Amber ran 8 miles, we multiply 8 by 3.5 to get Micah's distance.

8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We already know that Amber and Micah ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles together. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance run by all three.

52 - 36 = 16 miles

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. She returned one item that cost $15.00. So, the new balance is $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Then, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. The price after the discount is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

Next, she bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. The price after the discount is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the items she purchased: $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00. The new balance on her credit card is $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of those change color. This means that 1/5 of the jellyfish are large, and 1/3 of those change color. To find the total number of jellyfish, we need to find the number of large jellyfish that changed color and use that to calculate the total.

Let's start by finding the number of large jellyfish that changed color. We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, and this is 1/3 of the large jellyfish. We can set up an equation:

(1/3) * (1/5) * x = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15 (which is the least common multiple of 3 and 5):

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

Final answer: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the given information:

We know Chris is 4 years old. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age by multiplying Chris's age by 2. This gives us Ben's age as 2 * 4 = 8 years old.

Now, we know Ben is 8 years old. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so we can calculate Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3. This gives us Caroline's age as 3 * 8 = 24 years old.

The final answer is 24."

Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck. She wants to save for a retirement period of 20 years. If her current salary is $100,000, and she lives on 40% of her current salary, how many more years will she need to work?

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Lauren saves 20% of her salary, which is $20,000 per year.
2. She lives on 40% of her salary, which is $40,000 per year.
3. The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. Wait, that's not possible! Let's assume she saves 20% of her income, not 20% of her expenses.

If she saves 20% of her income, that's $20,000 per year.

Since she lives on 40% of her salary, she spends $40,000 per year.

Then, divide 25 cm by 5: 25 ÷ 5 = 5 cm per final cut.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to figure out what percentage of the school is made up of girls. We know that 40% of the school is made up of boys, and there are 240 boys. 

Let's use a simple equation to find the total number of students. We can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:
0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4:
x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"

The cost of the pots is $19 and the cost of the soil is $26. Let's add them together: $19 + $26 = $45.

Then, we subtract the coupon value of $7 from the total: $45 - $7 = $38.

So, the total amount spent is $38."
"To find the average height of heels, we need to add the total height of all the heels and divide by the total number of heels.

There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels and 3 women wearing 2-inch heels. We can add the total height of all the heels by multiplying the number of heels by their respective heights and then adding them together.

Total height of 4-inch heels: 3 x 4 = 12 inches
Total height of 2-inch heels: 3 x 2 = 6 inches
Total height of all heels: 12 + 6 = 18 inches

Now, we divide the total height by the total number of heels: 18 ÷ 6 = 3 inches

The average height of heels at the party is 3 inches.

"Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June, which has 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we need to divide the total number of miles by the number of days.

9,300 miles ÷ 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day. To do this, we subtract 125 miles from 310 miles.

310 miles - 125 miles = 185 miles

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final answer: 185"

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Together, they want 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

Since the question asks how many kilograms will be left, we need to subtract the amount they want from the total amount. 

12 - 7 = 5 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul will have 7 kg, and 5 kg will be left.

He saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.
He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.
He spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

Raymond has $8 left."
"To find the cost of each book, we need to first find the total amount Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. She then spent $2 on the books, so she had $12 - $2 = $10 left. But this is not possible since she has $2 left. This means the initial $4 she spent was not spent on the books. 

Let's recalculate: Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. She then spent $2 on the books, so she had $12 - $2 = $10 left. Since she has $2 left, the $10 must be the cost of the 2 books. 

Since both books cost the same amount, we can divide $10 by 2 to find the cost of each book: $10 ÷ 2 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the number of students last year and add it to the number of students last year.

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

Number of students last year = 50
Number of students this year = 50 + 10 = 60

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year."
"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find the time it takes for the light to blink once. 

Since the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can divide 5 minutes by 255 to find the time it takes for the light to blink once. 

Time per blink = 5 minutes / 255 blinks = 0.0198 minutes per blink

Now, we can multiply the time per blink by the total number of blinks to find the total time.

Total time = 0.0198 minutes per blink * 459 blinks = 9.05 minutes

So, it will take the light approximately 9.05 minutes to blink 459 times."
"To find the difference between the number of female and male fish, we need to add the initial number of fish and the number of fish Tate bought.

Let's start by adding the initial number of fish:

Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fish:
Total male fish: 6 + 5 = 11
Total female fish: 8 + 8 = 16

The difference between the total number of female fish and male fish is: 16 - 11 = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their chores.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add up the time each person took to complete their chores:
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance driven in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance and then multiply it by 2 (since he visits twice a month).

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, the total distance is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since he visits twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we need to figure out how far Sofie walks in 7 days first. Since Sofie walks 10 miles every day, we multiply 10 by 7.

10 * 7 = 70 miles

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we divide the distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian walks.

70 ÷ 2 = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour. We know that the first 4 workers produce 200 toys in 10 hours. 

The first 4 workers produce 200 toys in 10 hours. We can find out how many toys the first 4 workers produce per hour by dividing 200 by 10. 

200 ÷ 10 = 20 toys per hour for the first 4 workers.

Since the total number of toys needed is 400, and the first 4 workers produce 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce 400 - 200 = 200 toys.

The fifth worker works for 10 hours, so we can find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour by dividing 200 by 10.

200 ÷ 10 = 20 toys per hour for the fifth worker.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of both dogs: 
15 + 30 = 45 pounds

So, Elijah and Kory's dogs weigh 45 pounds altogether."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob. So, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially.

Since Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris, and Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers.

Now, we know that Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Let's call the number of stickers Seth had ""x"". Since Luis had 23 stickers, Seth must have had 2 * 23 = 46 stickers initially.

The final answer is 46."
"To find the total number of M&M's, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Total M&M's = 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag * 30 M&M's/ounce
Total M&M's = 3 * 10 * 30
Total M&M's = 900

Now, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag to find the number of small bags.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag
Number of small bags = 900 / 10
Number of small bags = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly half the distance around the Earth, we need to divide the distance by his daily flying distance.

The Earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers, and Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. Half of the Earth's circumference is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we can divide the distance Alfie needs to fly by his daily distance to find the number of days it will take him to fly that distance.

Number of days = Distance to fly / Daily distance
= 20,000 km / 400 km
= 50 days

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow these steps:

First, we know the average car's speed is 120 mph. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, we multiply 120 by 5 to get the speed of the 2nd fastest car.

2nd fastest car speed = 120 * 5 = 600 mph

The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the faster car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.

Faster car speed = 600 * 1.25 = 750 mph

The faster car can go 750 mph."
"To find Vince's current age, we need to figure out how old he was two years ago. We know that two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Since Liam is 16 now, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

We can set up an equation: 14 = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago. To find Vince's age 2 years ago, we divide both sides by 2:

Vince's age 2 years ago = 14 / 2
Vince's age 2 years ago = 7

Now, we add 2 to find Vince's current age:

Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so we can say A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. So, we can write two equations:

C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)

We can substitute the second equation into the first one, which gives us (S + 12) + S = 30. Simplifying this, we get 2S + 12 = 30.

Solving for S, we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation, which gives us 2S = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9.

Now that we know S = 9, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives us C = 9 + 12 = 21.

We know that A = M, and we also know that A + M + C + S = 56. Substituting the values we found for C and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Simplifying this equation, we get 2A + 30 = 56. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2A = 26. Dividing both sides by 2, we get A = 13.

Now that we know A = 13, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted. This is C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the boxes separately.

First, let's find the number of boxes needed to hold all the crayons. Since each box can hold 8 crayons and Nik has 200 crayons, we can divide the total number of crayons by 8.

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Number of crayons per box
= 200 / 8
= 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is:
Total weight of boxes = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Now, we need to convert the weight of the crayons and boxes to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so we can divide the weight of the crayons and boxes by 16 to get the weight in pounds.

Weight of crayons in pounds = Weight of crayons in ounces / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

Weight of boxes in pounds = Weight of boxes in ounces / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is the sum of their individual weights:
Total weight = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find out how much John makes, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he cuts the tree into 4-foot logs, we divide the total length by the log length.

80 feet ÷ 4 feet/log = 20 logs

Next, we need to find out how many planks John can make from each log. Since he cuts each log into 5 planks, we multiply the number of logs by 5.

20 logs × 5 planks/log = 100 planks

Finally, we need to find out how much John makes from selling the planks. Since he sells each plank for $1.2, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

100 planks × $1.2/plank = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to add up their salaries.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Since she earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so their mother earns 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000."
"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to break it down into two parts: the time spent walking on the beach and the time spent walking on the sidewalk.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. To find the time it takes her to walk 2 miles on the beach, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Since we don't know her speed, we can use the proportion:

40 minutes / 2 miles = x minutes / 2 miles

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

40 × 2 = 2x
80 = 2x
x = 80 / 2
x = 40 minutes

So, it takes Grandma 40 minutes to walk 2 miles on the beach.

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, it will take her half the time to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. To find the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, we can divide the time it takes her to walk 2 miles on the sidewalk by 2:

40 minutes ÷ 2 = 20 minutes

Now, we can add the time it takes to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time:

40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

Therefore, it takes Grandma 60 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to calculate how much she has already saved and then figure out how much more she needs.

She saves $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved:
$4 x 8 = $32

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the total amount:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the amount she saves per week to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 ÷ $4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

Final answer: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

We have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, so we multiply 3 by 7 to get 21 blue birds. Then, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, so we multiply 2 by 4 to get 8 blue birds. Lastly, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To find out how many marbles Bob has initially, we need to figure out how many marbles he has before he receives 2 dozen more. We know that 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles. If he has 60 marbles after receiving 2 dozen, we can subtract 24 from 60 to find out how many marbles he had initially.

60 - 24 = 36

So, Bob initially had 36 marbles.

If he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36.

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10.

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, let's think about it step by step.

We know that Donny can drink the water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water, one is 33 degrees, and the other is unknown. He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, and now he can drink the water.

Let's say the unknown mug is x degrees. We know that the total amount of water Donny has is 5 ounces. Since he poured 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug, the amount of water left in the 33-degree mug is 0 ounces. The amount of water in the other mug is 1 ounce.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 1 ounce (from the other mug) + x ounces (from the unknown mug) = 5 ounces (total amount of water).

Now, we can solve for x: x = 5 - 1
x = 4

However, we know that the temperature of the other mug must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink the water. Since x = 4, which is less than 40, this is a problem.

But wait, we can try to find the minimum temperature of the other mug. If Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the minimum temperature of the other mug must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's think about it this way: if the other mug is 40 degrees, Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the 40-degree mug. This is because 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the 40-degree mug add up to 5 ounces, which is the total amount of water Donny has.

So, the minimum temperature of the other mug is 40 degrees.

Final answer: 40"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Milkie Cows Limited brings him 20 cows per day, and Broilers Limited brings him 10 chickens per day. We need to find the total number of animals after 21 days (3 weeks).

Let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens added:

Cows added per day: 20
Cows added in 21 days: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Chickens added per day: 10
Chickens added in 21 days: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, let's add the initial number of cows and chickens to the total number of cows and chickens added:

Total cows: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
Total chickens: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Total number of animals: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"To find the cost of each bagel, we need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels and then divide it by 9.

The total cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
10% of $40.00 is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we divide the total cost by 9 to find the cost of each bagel.
$36.00 ÷ 9 = $4.00.

The final answer is: $4.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Gomer ate 5 scoops of mashed potatoes. We also know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's start by finding out how many potatoes are needed for 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
3 scoops - 1 scoop = 2 scoops
6 potatoes - 3 potatoes = 3 potatoes

Now, we know that 3 potatoes are needed for 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we divide 3 potatoes by 2 scoops.
3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop

Now, we know that 1.5 potatoes are needed for 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 5 scoops, we multiply 1.5 potatoes by 5 scoops.
1.5 potatoes/scoop * 5 scoops = 7.5 potatoes

Since Gomer ate 5 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can now find out how many potatoes he ate.
7.5 potatoes - 5 scoops = 2.5 potatoes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.5}$"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs:

240 ÷ 12 = 20

So, Chester needs 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We also know that there are 17 green jellybeans and 34 red jellybeans. To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51
= 9

The number of blue jellybeans is 9."
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons per tree and then multiply by the number of years in a decade.

Number of trees: 5

"To find the number of women on the bus, we need to divide the total number of passengers by the total number of parts in the ratio. The total number of parts is 5 + 9 = 14.

We can then divide the total number of passengers (84) by the total number of parts (14): 84 ÷ 14 = 6.

Since the ratio of women is 9 parts, we multiply 9 by the value of one part (6): 9 × 6 = 54.

Now, we know that 20 women alighted from the bus. To find the number of women who remained, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women: 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is 34."

"To find the total number of days, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each type of picture scene and then add them together.

We can start by dividing the total number of each type of scene by the number of scenes she can draw per day.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since the days for each type of scene are not the same, we need to find the maximum number of days, which is 9 days.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.

Three dozen eggs is equal to 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

There are 4 children. 

36 ÷ 4 = 9 eggs per child.

Each child will receive 9 eggs."
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to multiply the number of days in May (31) by the daily cost of food per fish ($1).

Total cost = Number of days in May * Daily cost of food per fish
Total cost = 31 * $1
Total cost = $31

Jen spends $31 on food for her fish in May."
"To find the total number of roses Patricia has now, we need to subtract the number of roses she gave to her mother and then add the number of roses she bought.

Let's do the math:

Initial number of roses = 30
Number of roses given to her mother = 24
Number of roses bought = 15

Total number of roses now = Initial number of roses - Number of roses given to her mother + Number of roses bought
= 30 - 24 + 15
= 21

So, Patricia now has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The total distance traveled is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles. 

The total time taken is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply the probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12\%}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. We can represent this as an equation:

x + 5 = 27

To find the value of x, we subtract 5 from both sides:

x = 27 - 5
x = 22

So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. We can represent this as another equation:

x = 2y

Since we already found that x = 22, we can substitute this value into the equation:

22 = 2y

To find the value of y, we divide both sides by 2:

y = 22 ÷ 2
y = 11

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now, let's find the total number of seashells. We know that Carlos collected 22, Jim collected 27, and Carrey collected 11. We can add these numbers together:

22 + 27 + 11 = 60

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3:

60 ÷ 3 = 20

Each person got 20 seashells.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend:
20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week."
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:

60% of 5 minutes = 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes
So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song.
The length of the second song = 5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette:
Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
Total time = 5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

First, let's find the total cost. Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday. Each device costs $20. So, the total cost is:

Total cost = 2 * $20 + 4 * $20
Total cost = $40 + $80
Total cost = $120

Next, let's find the total selling price. Linus sells each device for twice the amount of the original price. So, he sells each device for 2 * $20 = $40. The total selling price is:

Total selling price = 2 * $40 + 4 * $40
Total selling price = $80 + $160
Total selling price = $240

Now, let's find the profit:

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $120
Profit = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know that Isabel is 7 feet tall. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can find Ned's height by subtracting 2 from Isabel's height: 7 - 2 = 5 feet. 

Next, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet. 

Finally, since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, we can find the length of the cane by dividing Carl's height by 2: 6 ÷ 2 = 3 feet.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles needed and then subtract the number of bottles they can produce per day.

Total energy demand of 2300 people = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since each bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Number of bottles needed = Total energy demand of 2300 people / 0.2

Number of days = 1

Now, we need to find the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce per day to meet the demand.

Number of bottles per day = Number of bottles needed per day
Number of bottles per day = 2300

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, they need to produce more bottles per day to meet the demand.

Additional bottles needed per day = Number of bottles per day - Number of bottles produced per day
Additional bottles needed per day = 2300 - 4200
Additional bottles needed per day = -1900

However, since we can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to find the correct number of bottles needed per day.

Let's try to find the correct number of bottles needed per day to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Number of bottles needed per day = Total energy demand of 2300 people / 0.2

Number of bottles needed per day = 2300

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, they need to produce more bottles per day to meet the demand.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies (since it's an octuplet).

Number of babies wearing purple = 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue = 1/4 * 8 = 2

Number of babies wearing bows = 1/3 * (number of purple wearers) + (number of blue wearers) 
= 1/3 * 6 + 2
= 2 + 2
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:
Probability = (number of purple bow wearers) / (total number of bow wearers)
= (number of purple wearers) / (number of purple wearers + number of blue wearers)
= 6 / (6 + 2)
= 6 / 8
= 3/4
= 0.75
= 75%

The final answer is 75."
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on all days.

Let's break it down:

Total reports received = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

We know that the reports received on Wednesday are the difference between the total reports and the reports received on Monday and Tuesday and Thursday and Friday. So, we can set up an equation:

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
= 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
= 5168 - 4043
= 1125

The number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To find out how much money Abraham will earn from selling all his unused land, we need to calculate the total amount he earned from each sale.

Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left. He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 20 * 3 = $60.

To find the total amount he earned, we add the money from the first two sales: $50 + $30 = $80. Then, we add the money from the last sale: $80 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to find half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from that number.

Haley is 26 years old, so half of her age is 26 / 2 = 13.

Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age, so we subtract 10 from 13: 13 - 10 = 3.

"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the number of face masks he uses in a day. Since he changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, we can multiply the number of face masks he changes per day by the number of times he goes out in 2 days.

Let's do the math: 2 face masks/day * 3 times/day = 6 face masks/day. Now, we multiply this by 2 days to get the total number of face masks used in 2 days: 6 face masks/day * 2 days = 12 face masks.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the number of eggs still hidden, we need to calculate the number of eggs each person finds and subtract that from the total number of eggs.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is 9."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply it by the amount he gets paid per collection.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we add the total number of apartments: 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1440 * 3 = 4320.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 4320 * 0.40 = $1728.

The final answer is: $1728"
"To find the total number of fruits the avocado tree can produce in 10 years, we need to calculate the fruits produced in each year.

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * 17150 - 200 = 17100 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 + 0 + 1000 = 52500

The total number of fruits that an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 52500."
"To find out how many dollars Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of $100.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. We can write an equation for this:

B = Y - 7

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope. We can write another equation for this:

R = 4B

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. We can write an equation for this:

Y + B + R = 37

Now, we can substitute the expressions for B and R in terms of Y into the third equation:

Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:

Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:

6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:

6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:

Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:

B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:

R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Rissa was given three times as much money as Ronnie. Since Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount of money she has left is 15 - x.

Since she is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

To solve for x, we can multiply 4/5 by 15:

15 - x = 12

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 15 - 12
x = 3

So, Rissa gave her sister $3. Now, we know that Rissa has 15 - 3 = $12 left.

Since Ronnie gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3. Now, we can find out how much money Ronnie has left:

Ronnie's initial money: $5
Ronnie gave her sister: $3
Ronnie's remaining money: $5 - $3 = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to divide the total amount of paint used (12 pints) into four equal parts since there are four colors of paint. Since half the mural is yellow, that means the other half is divided equally among the remaining three colors. 

Let's call the amount of each color 'x'. Since there are three colors (red, white, and purple) that are equal, we can set up the equation: 3x = 12

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 12 ÷ 3
x = 4

Since 'x' represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 4 pints.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 x 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 x 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet."
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them together.

On Monday, she counted 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add the number of clouds from each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

The total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide $1 by the cost of the new box. The new box costs $12, so we can divide $1 by $12.

$1 ÷ $12 = 1/12

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 1 by 12:

1 ÷ 12 = 0.0833

So, you can run approximately 0.0833 cycles for $1.

The correct answer is: 1/12 or 0.0833"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Thomas starts with $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he has 50 bills initially.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Then, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills and is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

After that, Thomas triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * 5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

The final answer is 300."
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, he recycled the chalk after using 2.25 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.25 inches at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. Then, 20% of the remaining chalk will be used each day.

0.20 * 2.25 = 0.45 inches (used each day)

Since the teacher has 2.25 inches of chalk left, we can set up an equation:

2.25 - 0.45x = 0

Solving for x, we get:

2.25 - 0.45x = 0
0.45x = 2.25
x = 2.25 / 0.45
x = 5

So, the teacher will use up the remaining chalk in 5 days.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We have two pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's use variables to represent the current ages of Wendy and Colin. Let W be Wendy's current age and C be Colin's current age.

From the first statement, we can write an equation:

W = 5(C + 7)

This equation says that Wendy's current age is equal to five times the sum of Colin's current age and 7.

Now, let's simplify the equation:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we can write another equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

This equation says that in 25 years, Colin's age will be one-third of Wendy's current age.

We can substitute W = 5C + 35 into this equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 3:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Now, let's isolate C by subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Next, let's subtract 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Finally, let's divide both sides by 2:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to divide the total amount of money he has ($27,000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

$27,000 ÷ $500 = 54 sets of 100 books

Since Bob is buying for 3 schools, we divide the total number of sets by 3.

54 sets ÷ 3 schools = 18 sets per school

Since each set has 100 books, we multiply the number of sets per school by 100.

18 sets per school × 100 books per set = 1800 books per school

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples. Then, he put 1 apple in his pocket and threw 1 apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. So, he now has 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples.

Next, he put all but 1 apple in his pocket, so he has 7 - 1 = 6 apples left. He threw 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. So, he now has 6 (previous) + 6 (new) = 12 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples.

"To find out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each friend eats and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so the total number of slices each friend eats is 6 + 4 = 10 slices.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. To find out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to divide the total number of slices eaten (60) by the total number of slices per pizza (12 + 8 = 20).

60 ÷ 20 = 3

So, Kate needs to buy 3 pizzas.

The nurses start with an unknown number of bandages. On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. This means they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had 12 bandages from the first day, so they had 12 + 28 = 40 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had 40 - 25 = 15 bandages left.

Since they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, and they had 15 bandages left after the third day, they must have had 78 + 15 = 93 bandages at the beginning of the third day.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to find out how many hours she works in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in April.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. So, her total hours worked in a week is 7.5 * 6 = 45 hours.

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total hours worked in April is 45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours.

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her total earnings from hourly rate is 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270.

Jen also receives an additional $10 for complete attendance. So, her total earnings is $270 + $10 = $280.

The final answer is: $280"
"To find the total amount Jason earned, we need to calculate the earnings from each task and add them together.

Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry, $1.50 for cleaning his room, $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb each week, and $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher.

Let's calculate the earnings from each task:

- Earning from emptying the dishwasher: 6 times * $0.50 = $3.00
- Earning from doing laundry: 1 time * $3.00 = $3.00
- Earning from taking the trash out: 2 times * $0.75 = $1.50
- Earning from cleaning the room: 1 time * $1.50 = $1.50

Total earnings: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To find the total amount of blood that ten sharks have, we need to calculate the amount of blood a single shark has first. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we multiply 40 by 3 to get the amount of blood a shark has:

40 × 3 = 120 gallons

Now, we multiply the amount of blood a single shark has by 10 to find the total amount of blood that ten sharks have:

120 × 10 = 1200 gallons

The final answer is 1200."
"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to add up the number of people who came in at each time.

First, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. Then, 40 more people came in at 10:00. So, the total is 50 + 40 = 90 people.

Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. Now, the total is 90 + 80 = 170 people.

Finally, by evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. So, the total is 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Since Alain bought 5 packs of red pens and each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 pens.

The number of black pens is twice the number of red pens, so it's 2 * 25 pens = 50 pens.

To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens: 25 pens + 50 pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is 75."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:
$600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. To find the cost of the cognac per bottle, we multiply the cost of the scotch by 1.5 (100% + 50%):
$60 × 1.5 = $90 per bottle

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 × $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac:
$600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

The total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees.

The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80 trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 (first day) + 80 (second day) = 140 trees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To find out how much root beer was available for the party, we need to calculate the amount remaining after each incident.

Fred started with 24 gallons of root beer. On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

Since there were 3 people at the party, we need to divide the remaining 5 gallons by 3 to find out how much each person got.

5 ÷ 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.67}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge. Let's say the number of coffee mugs is x.

The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. We know that this expression is equal to 40. So, we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to find the value of x:

x = 32 ÷ 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish in the tank. 

One-third of 66 is 66 ÷ 3 = 22.

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find the remaining fish. 
66 - 22 = 44

Next, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish. 
5/11 of 44 is 5/11 * 44 = 20.

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 
22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is 42."
"To find the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy had initially, we need to calculate the colors from the palettes and makeup sets.

Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 colors left.

The final answer is 19."
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the first floor and then subtract the height of the second floor.

The height of the first floor is 7 times the height of Mattison, who is 60 inches tall. So, the height of the first floor is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The height of the second floor is 3 times the height of Mattison, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Now, we subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"To find the number of shells team Alphas found, we need to calculate 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280

Now, we need to find the remaining shells after team Alphas found 280 shells.

Remaining shells = 700 - 280 = 420

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252

Now, we can find the number of shells team Gogetters found by subtracting the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells.

Shells found by team Gogetters = 420 - 252 = 168

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we need to add up the miles the first three dogs walk and then subtract that from the total miles all dogs need to walk.

The first dog walks 1 mile, the second dog walks 4 miles, and the third dog walks 3 miles. So, the total miles the first three dogs walk is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since all four dogs need to walk an average of 3 miles per day, we multiply 3 miles by 4 dogs to get the total miles all dogs need to walk: 3 * 4 = 12 miles.

Now, we subtract the total miles the first three dogs walk from the total miles all dogs need to walk: 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"To find out how much money John had leftover after paying his debts, we need to follow these steps:

First, we need to calculate 40% of the house's value. 40% of $250,000 is 0.4 x $250,000 = $100,000. This is the amount John borrowed.

Next, we need to find out how much of that he used to pay off his debts. 60% of $100,000 is 0.6 x $100,000 = $60,000. This is the amount he used to pay off his debts.

To find out how much he had leftover, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the total amount borrowed. So, $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find the total weight of the tunas caught, we need to add the weights of all three tunas: 
56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram:
128 * 0.50 = $64.

The total amount Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas to the market is $64."
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to calculate the difference between the selling price and the cost price.

The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. 
Cost price = $72
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
= (11 * 9)
= 99

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
= 99 - 72
= 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, the total amount of water removed is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the medium setting, the total amount of water removed is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran the dehumidifier for 5 days on the high setting, the total amount of water removed is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

To find the total amount of water removed, we add the amounts from each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we need to subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons.

"To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we need to calculate the amount of each medicine in one dose. 

The first medicine is 14 mL, and the second medicine is 3 times that amount, which is 3 x 14 = 42 mL. 

So, in one dose, Saanvi uses 14 + 42 = 56 mL. 

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8: 56 mL x 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is 448."
"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to multiply the capacity of Ali's class by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 1/8 * 120
= 120/8
= 15

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is 2 * 15
= 30

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of their capacities: 120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school)
= 120 + 30
= 150

The final answer is 150."
"To find the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the interest first.

The interest is 2% of the initial amount borrowed, which is $300.

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months. 

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Now, we add the interest to the total amount paid in 11 months to find the amount to be paid in the twelfth month.

Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = Total amount paid in 11 months + Interest
= $275 + $6
= $281

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to calculate the total number of diapers that need to be changed. Since there are 2 children and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diapers that need to be changed is:

2 children * 5 diaper changes per child = 10 diaper changes

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, Jordan will also change half of the diapers. To find out how many diapers Jordan changes, we divide the total number of diaper changes by 2:

10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar and then divide it by the efficiency and the percentage of red jelly beans.

The volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 360 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans: 360 / 0.8 = 450.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans: 450 * 0.3 = 135.

However, we know the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 135 = 765.

"To find the total number of people on the bus, we need to follow the steps:

1. The bus had 20 people initially.
2. 40 people entered the bus at the first stop, so the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. 
   3/4 of 40 is 30, so 30 people entered the bus at the second station.
   The total number of people on the bus is now 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, so the total number of people on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180.
5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the remaining spaces on the bus are 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits, we need to calculate the cost of her visits for the first 5 years and the next 3 years.

The cost of one visit increased by 150%, so the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, so she spent 5 * 3 = $15 per year. For 5 years, she spent 5 * $15 = $75.

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit is $5, and she visited the museum 3 times a year, so she spent 3 * $5 = $15 per year. For 3 years, she spent 3 * $15 = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits is $75 + $45 = $120.

The final answer is $120."
"To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students/grade * 3 grades = 30 students
30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students.

The time required for each group is 45 minutes. So, the total time required for 3 full groups is:

3 groups * 45 minutes/group = 135 minutes

For the 4th group with 2 students, the time required is 45 minutes.

Total time required = 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"To find the total amount Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the cost of the tables and the roof frames separately and then add them together.

The cost of 4 tables at $20 each is 4 x $20 = $80.

The final answer is $100."
"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to divide the total length of the board (40 feet) by 5, since the two pieces are equal to the sum of the shorter and longer piece.

Let's use the equation: x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4.

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we need to figure out how many pounds of meat he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds.

80 ÷ 16 = 5 pounds

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat, we can multiply the number of pounds by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds × 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for the cookout.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total amount of fabric Luke needs, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window.

Number of windows = 5
Width of each window = 35 inches

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

The final answer is: 350"
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cupcakes Carly made. We know that she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's say the number of cupcakes is x. Then, the number of brownies is 3x - 2.

We also know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount, and then add the cost of nail art.

The original cost of the manicure is $35, and the pedicure is $40. The total cost without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The 20% discount is 0.20 * $75 = $15. So, the discounted price is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art sessions (5 for each hand). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

Final answer: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

There are 3 magazines that send 12 issues each, so that's 3 x 12 = 36 issues per year.

There's also 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 x 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines per year."
"To solve this problem, we need to use some basic math skills. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Samantha has 27 paintings, and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. This means Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

We also know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, to find out how many paintings Kim has, we need to subtract 8 from Shelley's total.

Let's do that: 39 - 8 = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

The final answer is 31."
"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

First, we calculate the price in December. The price increased by 80% of $40, so we multiply $40 by 1.8 (which is 100% + 80% = 180%, or 1.8). 

$40 * 1.8 = $72

Then, we calculate the price in January. The price decreased by 50% of $72, so we multiply $72 by 0.5 (which is 100% - 50% = 50%, or 0.5).

$72 * 0.5 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from each type of lesson and add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount he earns from the 4 1-hour lessons at the standard rate. Since the standard rate is $80 per hour, we multiply 4 hours by $80:

4 * $80 = $320

Next, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran. The standard rate is $80, but he reduces it by 25% for veterans. To find the reduced rate, we need to calculate 25% of $80:

25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20

Now, we subtract $20 from the standard rate:

$80 - $20 = $60

Since there are 2 lessons at this rate, we multiply $60 by 2:

2 * $60 = $120

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of lessons:

$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."

"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first find out how many pomelos she had left. Since she had 1/4 of the original amount left, we can set up the equation:

20 - (1/4) * 20 = ?

To solve this, we can multiply 1/4 by 20:

(1/4) * 20 = 5

Now, we subtract 5 from 20:

20 - 5 = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how much money Walter got from selling the apples, we need to first find out how many apples he had left after eating some and giving some to his sister.

Walter started with 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and then divide by 5.

60 * 2 = 120
120 ÷ 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we need to find out how many apples he had left. We subtract 24 from 60.

60 - 24 = 36

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25.

36 * 0.25 = 9

Now, we subtract 9 from 36 to find out how many apples Walter had left.

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he got, we multiply 27 by 3.

27 * 3 = $81

The final answer is: $81"

"To find the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled and then divide it by the total distance between Alaska and Texas.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr, and he traveled for 3 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the speed by the total hours traveled: 50 km/hr * 72 hours = 3600 km.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total distance covered. The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage, we divide the distance covered (3600 km) by the total distance (6000 km) and multiply by 100.

Percentage covered = (3600 / 6000) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

So, Michael covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the initial number of grapes, we need to work backwards.

Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total grapes used by the family is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (by the mother) = 84 grapes.

Therefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.

Final answer: 84"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of sick teachers and the number of substitute teachers.

Number of sick teachers: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

Total number of teachers: 13 + 9 = 22

There were 22 teachers at school that day."
"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of pasta is $1.00 per box, and Bud buys one box per week. The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00 per week, and the cost of gruyere cheese is twice that amount, which is $6.00 per week. 

The total cost per week is $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total cost per year is $10.00 per week * 52 weeks per year = $520.00 per year.

The final answer is: $520"
"To find the total time spent cleaning, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom: 
80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours: 
1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

Now, we need to find the percentage of the day spent cleaning. To do this, we'll divide the time spent cleaning by the total time worked and multiply by 100: 
(20 hours / 40 hours) * 100 = 50%

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. Since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the shelves: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books
Total capacity: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves to find the number of bookcases needed:
110 ÷ 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the books. Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases.

Final answer: 3"
"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

First, let's find the total cost:
Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 5 dozens will have 5 x 12 = 60 eggs. The total cost is 5 x $2.40 = $12.

Next, let's find the total selling price:
Rose will sell each egg for $1, so the total selling price is 60 x $1 = $60.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
= $60 - $12
= $48

The final answer is: $48"
"To find the number of white hats, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that half of the hats are red. Since there are 100 hats in total, half of them would be 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.

Now, we need to find the number of hats that are not red. We subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats: 100 - 50 = 50 hats that are not red.

Next, we know that 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find the number of blue hats, we multiply the number of non-red hats by 3/5: 3/5 * 50 = 30 blue hats.

Finally, the rest of the hats are white. We subtract the number of blue hats from the number of non-red hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is:
$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost per stick:
$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100:
$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To figure out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to get correct overall. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, and the total number of questions is 110 (70 from the first test and 40 from the second test), she needs to get 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions correct.

She got 60% of the first test correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions. So, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is 35."
"To find the number of blueberry cubes, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is x. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she has played by the number of points she scores per game.

The total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To find out how many marbles Brendan ended up with, let's break down the events:

Brendan started with 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. Then, he found 3 more marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. Finally, he picked up a bead instead of a marble, so he got rid of 1 marble. 

Now, he has 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of customers Jason needs to get to sell 15 cars.
Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, Jason needs 15 / 1 = 15 customers to sell 15 cars.

Step 2: Calculate the number of customers Jason needs to get from potential customers.
Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, Jason needs 15 / 1 = 15 * 2 = 30 potential customers to get 15 customers.

Step 3: Calculate the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 potential customers.
Since for every 25 telephone calls, 1 potential customer is generated, Jason needs 30 / 1 = 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls to get 30 potential customers.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of each type of light source.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each.

Half of the rooms is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms. 
4 rooms with 4 small candles each will have 4 * 4 = 16 small candles.
4 rooms with 5 medium candles each will have 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.

Total number of candles = 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Total number of candles and flashlights = 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members.

We know that Mitchell buys 2 bags of chips with 55 chips in each bag. So, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110 chips.

There are 5 family members. To find out how many chips each person gets, we divide the total number of chips by 5.

Number of chips per person = Total number of chips / Number of family members
= 110 chips / 5
= 22 chips

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time it takes for each side. The first side takes 5 minutes. The second and third sides take twice as long, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes. The last two sides take half as long as the first, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

The total time to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes."
"To find the total number of items, we need to figure out how many robots, helmets, and footballs there are.

We know there are 20 helmets. Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can divide 20 by 2 to find the number of robots:

Number of robots = 20 ÷ 2
Number of robots = 10

We also know there are half as many helmets as footballs. Since there are 20 helmets, we can multiply 20 by 2 to find the number of footballs:

Number of footballs = 20 × 2
Number of footballs = 40

Now, we can add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs to find the total number of items:

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends on calls and then divide that by the time it takes to deal with one call.

Since Tim spends 6 hours a day on calls, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can multiply 6 hours by 60 minutes to get the total minutes per day. 

6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes per day

Since there are 5 days in a work week, we multiply the total minutes per day by 5 to get the total minutes per week.

360 minutes/day * 5 days = 1800 minutes per week

It takes Tim 15 minutes to deal with one call, so we divide the total minutes per week by 15 to get the total number of calls.

1800 minutes / 15 minutes/call = 120 calls per week

The final answer is 120."
"To find out how much longer it takes for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the time it would take for each varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

To find the difference, we subtract the time it takes for the old varnish from the time it takes for the new varnish: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the amount of water for each group of plants and add them together.

First, let's calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water. This is 4 x 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, we have 8 plants that need 1 cup of water, so that's 8 x 1 = 8 cups.

The remaining plants are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants. These plants need a quarter of a cup of water, so that's 8 x 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's add the water needed for each group: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes to cover the land and water parts separately.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. 

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute
Time on land = 5 minutes

Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute
Time in water = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on land + Time in water
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 15 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To find the total cost, we need to divide the number of popsicle sticks needed (56) by the number of sticks per box (8) to find out how many boxes Bob needs to buy.

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Since Bob needs 7 boxes, and each box costs $2.00, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

7 x $2.00 = $14.00

The total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 x $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones: $20 + $40 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in June and then multiply it by the price per doughnut.

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts per day. Since there are 12 doughnuts in a dozen, he makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

Since June has 30 days, Derrick makes 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts in June.

Since each doughnut is sold at $2, Derrick makes 3600 * 2 = $7200 in June.

The final answer is: $7200"
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first find his new speed in words per minute.

John's original speed is 150 words per minute. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 2.5 * 150 = 375 words per minute.

Since each page has 450 words, the total number of words in 10 pages is 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take to speak 4500 words at 375 words per minute, we divide the total number of words by the speed: 
4500 ÷ 375 = 12 minutes.

"To find the total number of kernels that popped, we need to add up the kernels that popped in each time period.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. Then, in the next 30 seconds, 3 times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to 4 times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped. Finally, in the last 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 40 kernels popped.

Let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat. A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required. Since he wants to make 5 gallons of lemonade (4 regular gallons and 1 extra gallon that's twice as tart), we first need to find out how many cups of lemon juice he needs.

Since 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice, we multiply the number of gallons by 1:

5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed by dividing the total cups of lemon juice by 6:

5 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 5 * 6/6 = 5

So, Tim will need 5 lemons.

"To find the total amount of dog food needed, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The German Shepherds eat 5 kilograms of dog food per day, and there are 3 of them. So, the total amount of food they eat in a day is 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms.

The Bulldogs eat 3 kilograms of dog food per day, and there are 2 of them. So, the total amount of food they eat in a day is 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms.

Now, we add the total amount of food the German Shepherds and Bulldogs eat in a day: 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

To find the total amount of food needed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

The Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."

"To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first part of the journey (west), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

For the second part of the journey (east), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Total distance traveled = 90 miles + 144 miles = 234 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. To do this, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after 1 year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after 2 years = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after 3 years = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies.

The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so:
Orange candies = 2 * 54 = 108

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so:
Yellow candies = 54 / 2 = 27

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
Red + Orange + Yellow = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
232 - 189 = 43

Therefore, there are 43 pink candies in the bag."
"To find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the bus trips first.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 10% of $80.
10% of $80 = 0.1 x $80 = $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is:
$8 x 7 = $56

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is:
$80 (hotel) + $56 (bus trips) = $136

"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, luggage, and the children.

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and the two children weigh 75 pounds each. So, the total weight is:

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."

"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we need to add their ages and divide by 2. 

Mia is 40 years old, and Emma is 16 years older than Mia. So, we can find Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2

Next, let's calculate the cost of the salad plates. There are 12 salad plates at $4.00 each. We can multiply the number of plates by the cost per plate to get the total cost: 12 x $4.00 = $48.00.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the bowls. There are 12 bowls at $5.00 each. We can multiply the number of bowls by the cost per bowl to get the total cost: 12 x $5.00 = $60.00.

Now, let's add the costs together: $72.00 + $48.00 + $60.00 = $180.00.

The total cost of the place settings will be $180.00."
"To find Anna's time, we need to first find half of Steve's time. 

Half of Steve's time is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

Since Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, we add 2 hours to 5 hours. 

Anna's time = 5 + 2 = 7 hours.

The final answer is 7."
"To find out how much feed Dexter's pigs eat in a day, we need to multiply the number of pigs by the amount of feed each pig eats per day.

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7.

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much is left, we subtract the total feed consumed from the total ordered.

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how many hot dogs John needs, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs required: 20 * 2 = 40

Since John already has 4 hot dogs, we subtract those from the total:
40 - 4 = 36

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs.
Number of packs needed: 36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs 6 packs, and each pack costs $2, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
6 * $2 = $12

John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total income and total expenses.

She sells 20 cupcakes for $2 each, so her income from cupcakes is 20 * $2 = $40.
She also sells 40 cookies for $1 each, so her income from cookies is 40 * $1 = $40.
Her total income is $40 + $40 = $80.

Frances buys 5 trays of cupcakes for $4 each, so her total expenses are 5 * $4 = $20.

To find out how much money Frances has left, we subtract her total expenses from her total income:
$80 - $20 = $60

Frances has $60 left."
"To find the total number of children following the truck, we need to calculate the number of children on each street.

On the first street, there are 5 children.
On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.
On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + 10*2 = 10 + 20 = 30.

However, the original 5 children then leave the group, so we need to subtract them from the total number of children. The total number of children remaining is 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 children following the truck."
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals.

Total meals = 1,360
Meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48 = 142

Meals left = Total meals - Meals given out
Meals left = 1,360 - 142
Meals left = 1,218

The final answer is: 1218"
"To find the total amount of money James has, we need to calculate the value of each coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth 25 cents. Two nickels are worth 2 x 5 cents = 10 cents. Seven dimes are worth 7 x 10 cents = 70 cents.

Now, let's add the values together: 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = 105 cents.

The total amount of money James has is 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to find the age of the older brother first. Since one brother is 12 years old and that is half the age of the older brother, we can find the age of the older brother by multiplying 12 by 2.

12 * 2 = 24

Now that we know the age of the older brother, we can find the age of the younger brother. Since the older brother is 24 years old, the younger brother is 12 years old.

Now we have the ages of all the siblings: 
- 2 brothers: 12 and 24 years old
- 3 sisters: 16 years old each

To find the total age, we add up the ages of all the siblings: 
24 + 12 + (16 * 3) = 24 + 12 + 48 = 84

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"Charisma practices meditation for 15 minutes twice a day, which is a total of 30 minutes per day. She does this for 4 weeks, which is 28 days. So, the total time spent on meditation is 30 * 28 = 840 minutes.

She also practices yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, she practices yoga for 5 * 4 = 20 days. The total time spent on yoga is 1 * 20 = 20 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60: 20 * 60 = 1200 minutes.

The total time spent on meditation and yoga is 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: 2040"
"To find the total square feet of fabric needed for the quilt, we need to calculate the area of each type of shirt and add them together.

First, let's calculate the area of each type of shirt:
- Small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
- Medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
- Large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Now, let's add the total area of each type of shirt:
33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet

The quilt will require 101 square feet of fabric."
"To find the total number of sunflower seeds, we need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then add 50% more seeds to it.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. Then, we add 18 to 36, resulting in 54 seeds.

Now, we add the seeds from the small sunflower (36) and the large sunflower (54) to get the total number of seeds: 36 + 54 = 90.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to figure out how many pens Timothy has first. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can multiply 18 by 3 to find Timothy's pens.

18 × 3 = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can divide 54 by 2.

54 ÷ 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens."
"To find Jackie's height before the summer, we need to subtract the amount she grew from her current height. We know she grew 3 inches over the summer. 

We know Albert is 36 inches tall, and Anne is twice the size of Albert. So, Anne is 2 x 36 inches = 72 inches. Since Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, Jackie is 72 inches - 2 inches = 70 inches.

Now, to find Jackie's height before the summer, we subtract the amount she grew: 70 inches - 3 inches = 67 inches.

The final answer is 67 inches."
"To find out how much money the company will make from selling the chocolate bars, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

The company produces 5000 bars in one day. There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, there are 7 * 2 = 14 days. 

Multiply the number of bars produced in one day by the number of days in two weeks: 5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70,000 bars.

The price per bar is $2. Multiply the total number of bars by the price per bar: 70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000.

The final answer is: $140,000"
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

For the T-shirts:
- Original price of each T-shirt: $8
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts, so the total cost of the T-shirts is 2 x $8 = $16
- Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt.
- The discount on the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is 0.5 x $8 = $4.
- So, the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 - $4 = $4.
- The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes:
- Original price of the shoes: $40
- Jake buys the shoes at 40% off, so the discount is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 x $40 = $16.
- The cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his earnings from completing chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are:
6 * 3 = 18

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of the ice cream cones is:
1.25 * 4 = 5

Now, subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings:
18 - 5 = 13

Ryan has $13 left. Now, we need to find out how many movie tickets he can buy with $13. Each ticket costs $6.50, so we can divide $13 by $6.50 to find out how many tickets he can buy:
13 ÷ 6.50 = 2

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add up the costs of all the items purchased.

Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So, Ellen spent $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes for $100 each. Since there are two bathrobes, we multiply the cost by 2: $100 x 2 = $200. Then, we add the cost of the sunglasses: $30 + $200 = $230.

To find the total amount spent, we add Ellen's and Lani's totals: $105 + $230 = $335.

The final answer is: $335"
"To find the total cost of making one jar, we need to calculate the cost of the ingredients. The cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey.

Cost of passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12
Cost of jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12
Cost of honey: 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20
Total cost of one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, to find the profit per jar, we subtract the cost from the selling price:
Profit per jar = Selling price - Total cost
Profit per jar = $50 - $44
Profit per jar = $6

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
Total profit = Profit per jar * 10
Total profit = $6 * 10
Total profit = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

We have 32 quarters, 95 dimes, 120 nickels, and 750 pennies. 

- 32 quarters = 32 x $0.25 = $8
- 95 dimes = 95 x $0.10 = $9.50
- 120 nickels = 120 x $0.05 = $6
- 750 pennies = 750 x $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add the values together:
$8 + $9.50 = $17.50
$17.50 + $6 = $23.50
$23.50 + $7.50 = $31

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."

- $8.50 on a bracelet

Total amount spent = $3.50 + $7.50 + $7.50 + $8.50 = $28

Janet's parents gave her $40.

Amount left = $40 - $28 = $12

Janet has $12 left."
"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he is open and the number of cars he services in that time.

Josh is open 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). In 2 weeks, he is open 6 * 2 = 12 days.

Since he services 3 cars a day, in 12 days, he services 3 * 12 = 36 cars.

He gets paid $4 per car, so for 36 cars, he makes 36 * 4 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. He eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This means he now has:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

Then, he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, he now has:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 sugar cookies (no change)

Next, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he now has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he now has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we add the number of each type of cookie: 6 + 7 + 6 = 19.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get from each half of his collection and add them together.

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers and wants to sell them for a fair price. He found a buyer who is willing to pay for half his collection $5 per toy, and for the other half $7 per toy. 

First, we need to find half of 12, which is 6. This means Matthew will sell 6 toys for $5 each and 6 toys for $7 each.

For the first half (6 toys at $5 each), Matthew would earn: 6 * 5 = $30

For the second half (6 toys at $7 each), Matthew would earn: 6 * 7 = $42

Total amount Matthew would earn: $30 + $42 = $72

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many days it takes to fill them.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

To fill 84 holes, it will take:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

Final answer: 4"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School first.

Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. Since Norman High School has 4000 students, we can multiply 4000 by 3/4 to find the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. However, Igor didn't gather the correct number of test tubes. He gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

Igor also gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes. The number of beakers he gathered is still 7.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + 7 (beakers) = 31. However, he only placed 29 items on the lab bench. This means he lost 31 - 29 = 2 items.

Since Igor lost 2 items in total, and we know he gathered 8 test tubes and 16 Petri dishes, we can set up an equation to find the number of beakers he lost:

Let x be the number of beakers Igor lost.

We know that the total number of items he gathered is 8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + 7 (beakers) - x (beakers lost) = 29.

8 + 16 + 7 - x = 29

Combine like terms:

31 - x = 29

Subtract 31 from both sides:

-x = -2

Multiply both sides by -1:

x = 2

So, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"To find the total number of screws needed, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table and then by the number of screws per leg.

Number of tables: 4
Number of legs per table: 4
Number of screws per leg: 2

Total screws needed = 4 x 4 x 2 = 32

James has 40 screws. To find the number of screws left over, we subtract the total screws needed from the total screws he has:

40 - 32 = 8

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket (10) to the number of eggs in the second basket (which is twice as many as the first basket, so 10 x 2 = 20).

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to add up the amounts each person raised.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it took Vanessa to run her part of the race. We know that Aaron ran twice as fast as Vanessa, and Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron. 

Let's start by finding Aaron's speed. We know that Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. To find his speed, we can divide the time by the distance: 16 minutes ÷ 2 miles = 8 minutes per mile.

Since Vanessa ran twice as fast as Aaron, her speed is 2 times Aaron's speed: 8 minutes per mile × 2 = 16 minutes per mile.

Now, we know Vanessa's speed and the distance she ran (4 miles). To find the time it took her to run 4 miles, we can multiply her speed by the distance: 16 minutes per mile × 4 miles = 64 minutes.

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

64"
"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we need to calculate the length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply 200 by 3.

200 x 3 = 600

However, he already has 6 feet of line. So, we need to subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required.

600 - 6 = 594

The caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the daily revenue and then multiply it by 2 (since they are open 2 days a week).

First, let's calculate the daily revenue. They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation has 2 meals that cost $5 each, plus a $5 bottle of wine. So, the total cost for one reservation is 2 * $5 + $5 = $15. Since they get 6 reservations a night, the daily revenue is 6 * $15 = $90.

Now, let's multiply the daily revenue by 2 to find the weekly revenue: $90 * 2 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to calculate the cost per watermelon and then add a 25% profit.

The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. To find the cost per watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons:

Cost per watermelon = Total cost ÷ Number of watermelons
= $80 ÷ 50
= $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price with a 25% profit. To do this, we multiply the cost per watermelon by 1.25 (100% + 25% profit):

Selling price = Cost per watermelon × 1.25
= $1.60 × 1.25
= $2.00

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. So, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.
2. Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.
3. We also know that James was born when John was 19 years old. So, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.
4. John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.
5. To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 5 + 3 = 8 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana peels than Jane in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. 

We can find out how many oranges each person peels in an hour by dividing 60 minutes by the time it takes each person to peel one orange.

Ana peels 60 ÷ 3 = 20 oranges in an hour.
Jane peels 60 ÷ 4 = 15 oranges in an hour.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the cost of the radiator, we need to calculate the discount first. The original price is $400, and Mark gets 80% off. 

80% of $400 is 0.8 * $400 = $320. This is the discount amount. To find the cost of the radiator, we subtract the discount from the original price: $400 - $320 = $80.

Next, we need to calculate the labor cost. The mechanic charges $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours. So, the labor cost is 3 * $50 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost: $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of legs for each type of animal. 

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's say the number of chickens is x. Then, the number of cows is 20 - x.

The total number of legs is 70. We can set up an equation:

2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Simplifying the equation:
2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x + 80 = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

So, there are 5 chickens.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56.

There are 4 people who want to share the pizzas equally. 

Now, divide the total number of slices (56) by the number of people (4):

56 ÷ 4 = 14

So, each person can have 14 slices."
