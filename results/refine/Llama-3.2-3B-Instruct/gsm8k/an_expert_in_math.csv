"To determine Janet's daily earnings at the farmers' market, we must first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she consumes and bakes.

Janet's daily egg production is 16. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast, leaving her with 16 - 3 = 13 eggs. She then bakes 4 eggs for her friends, resulting in 13 - 4 = 9 eggs available for sale.

The selling price of each egg is $2. To find Janet's daily earnings, we multiply the number of eggs sold (9) by the selling price ($2):

9 eggs * $2/egg = $18

Janet's daily earnings at the farmers' market are $18."
"To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fiber separately.

The problem states that the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. Since the amount of white fiber is specified as half that of the blue fiber, we can calculate it as follows:

White fiber = (1/2) × Blue fiber
= (1/2) × 2
= 1 bolt

Now, we can find the total number of bolts required by adding the amount of blue and white fiber:

Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
= 2 + 1
= 3

Therefore, the total number of bolts required for the robe is 3."
"To calculate the profit, we need to determine the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To find the new value, we multiply the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase). 

New value = $80,000 * 2.5
= $200,000

Now, we subtract the original price from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

The final answer is: $120,000"
"To calculate the total number of meters James runs per week, we can utilize the fundamental principles of arithmetic. Specifically, we will employ the multiplication operation, which is a basic yet essential concept in mathematics.

The problem involves multiplying the number of sprints per week (3) by the number of meters per sprint (60). This can be represented as:

Total meters per week = Number of sprints per week × Number of meters per sprint
Total meters per week = 3 × 60

Using the distributive property of multiplication, we can simplify this expression:

Total meters per week = 3 × 60
Total meters per week = 3 × (60)
Total meters per week = 3 × 60
Total meters per week = 180

Therefore, James runs 180 meters per week.

The final answer is: 180"
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we must first calculate the total daily feed requirement for her flock. Given that each chicken receives three cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens in the flock, the total daily feed requirement can be calculated as follows:

Total daily feed = Number of chickens * Feed per chicken
Total daily feed = 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken
Total daily feed = 60 cups

Since Wendi has already provided 40 cups of feed, we can subtract this amount from the total daily feed requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal:

Final meal feed = Total daily feed - Feed already provided
Final meal feed = 60 cups - 40 cups
Final meal feed = 20 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs 20 cups of feed for the final meal."
"To calculate the total cost of the glasses, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.

The cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the price of the first glass. This can be expressed as 0.6 * $5 = $3 per glass.

The total cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the first glass to the cost of the remaining glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay a total of $50 for the glasses.

The final answer is $50."
"To determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as S, Charleston as C, and Toulouse as T.

Given that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we can express this relationship as C = 4S. Additionally, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so T = 2C.

We are also given that Seattle has 20 sheep, which allows us to solve for S: S = 20.

Now, we can substitute S into the equation C = 4S to find the number of sheep in Charleston: C = 4 * 20 = 80.

Next, we can substitute C into the equation T = 2C to find the number of sheep in Toulouse: T = 2 * 80 = 160.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in each city: Total = S + C + T = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To calculate the total time taken to download the file, we can break it down into two parts: the first download and the second download.

The first download consists of 80% of the 200 GB file, which is 0.8 * 200 = 160 GB. Given that Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute, the time taken for the first download is:

Time = Total size / Download speed
Time = 160 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 80 minutes

The second download also takes 80 minutes, as the download is restarted from the beginning.

Total time taken = Time for first download + Time for second download
Total time taken = 80 minutes + 80 minutes
Total time taken = 160 minutes

Therefore, the total time taken to download the file is 160 minutes."
"To determine the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we can break down the journey into segments.

First, we calculate the distance John traveled during the initial 3 hours at 60 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, he doesn't move, so the distance remains 180 miles.

Next, we calculate the distance John traveled during the 0.5 hours at 30 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

Finally, we calculate the distance John traveled during the remaining 2 hours at 80 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles

The total distance traveled is the sum of these segments:

Total Distance = 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles

Since John initially drove 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:

Distance from Home = Total Distance - Initial Distance = 355 - 180 = 175 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To calculate Eliza's total earnings for the week, we can break down her earnings into two components: regular pay and overtime pay.

First, we calculate her regular pay for the first 40 hours:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Next, we calculate her overtime pay for the remaining 5 hours, taking into account the 1.2 times her regular hourly rate:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the regular pay and overtime pay to find her total earnings for the week:
$400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460.

Final answer: $460"
"To calculate the total number of downloads over the three months, we can break down the problem into individual components.

First, we need to find the number of downloads in the second month, which is three times the downloads in the first month. This can be expressed as:

Downloads in Month 2 = 3 * Downloads in Month 1
= 3 * 60
= 180

Next, we need to calculate the number of downloads in the third month, which is 30% less than the downloads in the second month. This can be expressed as:

Downloads in Month 3 = Downloads in Month 2 - (30% of Downloads in Month 2)
= 180 - (0.3 * 180)
= 180 - 54
= 126

Now, we can find the total number of downloads over the three months by adding the downloads in each month:

Total Downloads = Downloads in Month 1 + Downloads in Month 2 + Downloads in Month 3
= 60 + 180 + 126
= 366

The final answer is: $\boxed{366}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we can break down the problem into individual components and apply the given prices.

First, we'll calculate the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts * $68 per dozen = $204.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen cupcakes * $80 per dozen = $160.

Lastly, we'll calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen cheesecakes * $55 per dozen = $330.

Now, we'll add these costs together to find the total: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine the break-even point for the lemon tree, we can use the concept of net present value (NPV). The NPV is the difference between the present value of the future cash flows and the initial investment.

Let's calculate the NPV of the annual cash flows:

Year 1: -$90 (initial investment) + $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = -$78.50
Year 2: -$78.50 (previous year's NPV) + $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = -$71
Year 3: -$71 (previous year's NPV) + $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = -$63.50
Year 4: -$63.50 (previous year's NPV) + $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = -$56
Year 5: -$56 (previous year's NPV) + $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = -$48.50
Year 6: -$48.50 (previous year's NPV) + $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = -$41
Year 7: -$41 (previous year's NPV) + $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = -$33.50
Year 8: -$33.50 (previous year's NPV) + $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = -$26
Year 9: -$26 (previous year's NPV) + $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = -$18.50
Year 10: -$18.50 (previous year's NPV) + $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = -$11
Year 11: -$11 (previous year's NPV) + $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $3.50
Year 12: $3.50 (previous year's NPV) + $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $11

At the end of Year 12, the NPV is $11, which is greater than the initial investment of -$90. Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

Final answer: 12"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic manipulation to represent the situation and solve for the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as x. We know that Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which can be represented as x/3. She sold 2 more at the red house, so the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red house is x/3 + 2.

The number of vacuum cleaners remaining after selling at the green and red house is x - (x/3 + 2) = 2x/3 - 2.

She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/6 - 1.

The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is x/3 + 2 + x/6 - 1. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2 + x/6 - 1) = 5

To simplify the equation, we can find a common denominator, which is 6. Multiply the first term by 6/6 to get:

(6x/6) - (2x/6 + 2*3/6 - 1*6/6) = 5

Combine like terms:

6x/6 - 2x/6 - 6/6 + 6/6 = 5

Simplify:

4x/6 - 6/6 = 5

Combine like terms:

4x/6 = 5 + 6/6

Simplify:

4x/6 = 11/6

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction:

4x = 11

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 11/4

x = 2.75

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.75}$"
"To determine the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can employ a step-by-step approach.

First, we calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 students, which is equal to 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after subtracting those enrolled in contemporary dance: 20 - 4 = 16 students.

Then, we calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25% of the remaining students: 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

Finally, we determine the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the total remaining students: 16 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

Therefore, the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine the best choice, we can calculate the potential profit for each option using the concept of compound interest. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount after t years, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time the money is invested for.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5% = 0.025
Time: 1 month
Since the interest is compounded monthly, we can use the formula A = P(1 + r)^t, where r = 0.025 and t = 1.

Potential value of jewelry = $5,000(1 + 0.025)^1 = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2% = 0.012
Time: 1 month
Since the interest is compounded monthly, we can use the same formula A = P(1 + r)^t, where r = 0.012 and t = 1.

Potential value of electronic gadgets = $8,000(1 + 0.012)^1 = $8,160

To determine the best choice, we compare the potential values of the two options. The merchant should choose the option with the higher potential value.

The potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is higher than the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250). Therefore, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

The merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets.

The final answer is: $160"
"To determine the total distance covered by each train, we can utilize the concept of vector addition. Since the trains traveled in two different directions, we need to break down the distances into their respective components.

Let's denote the distance traveled westward as x and the distance traveled northward as y. We are given that the trains traveled 80 miles westward and 150 miles northward. 

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the total distance covered by each train:

√(x² + y²) = √(80² + 150²)
= √(6400 + 22500)
= √28900
≈ 170 miles

Since the trains traveled the same distance, the total distance covered by each train is approximately 170 miles.

The final answer is: 170"
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we can break down her earnings into two components: teaching and coaching. 

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from teaching: 
35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching can be calculated as:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from coaching: 
15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week

Her annual earnings from coaching can be calculated as:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, we can find her total annual salary by adding her earnings from teaching and coaching:
$35,000/year (teaching) + $22,500/year (coaching) = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we can utilize the concept of unit conversion and multiplication.

First, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Claire consumes in 4 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs she makes per day (3) by the number of days in 4 weeks (28):

3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs

Next, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12 (since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs):

84 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the required speed for the remaining distance, we can utilize the concept of average speed and the formula for average speed, which is:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

We know that Marissa wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail. Let's calculate the total time she needs to spend to achieve this average.

Total Distance = 12 miles
Average Speed = 4 miles per hour
Total Time = Total Distance / Average Speed
Total Time = 12 / 4
Total Time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, we need to find the speed required to cover the remaining distance in 1 hour.

Remaining Distance = Total Distance - Distance covered so far
Remaining Distance = 12 - (4 + 2)
Remaining Distance = 12 - 6
Remaining Distance = 6 miles

Speed Required = Distance / Time
Speed Required = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed Required = 6 miles per hour

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour to maintain her desired average speed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we must first calculate the total amount of water in the initial mixture. 

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in 10 liters of orange drink is:
10 * (2/3) = 20/3 liters

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is:
15 * (3/5) = 9 liters

The total amount of water in both drinks initially is:
20/3 + 9 = 49/3 liters

However, 1 liter of the orange drink was spilled. To find the amount of water lost, we need to calculate the fraction of the orange drink that is water:
1 * (2/3) = 2/3 liters

The amount of water lost is 2/3 liters. To find the amount of water remaining in the orange drink after spilling, we subtract the amount lost from the initial amount:
20/3 - 2/3 = 18/3 = 6 liters

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the sum of the water in the pineapple drink and the remaining water in the orange drink:
6 + 9 = 15 liters

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of years ago Raymond's son was born, we can calculate the difference between Raymond's current age and the age of his son.

Let's denote Raymond's current age as R and his son's age as S. We know that R = 25 (since Raymond is 25 years old) and S = 23 (since Raymond had a son at the age of 23).

The number of years ago Raymond's son was born can be calculated as:

Years ago = R - S
Years ago = 25 - 23
Years ago = 2

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of DVDs sold, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers: 3 customers * 1 DVD/customer = 3 DVDs.

Next, we calculate the total number of DVDs sold to the next 2 customers: 2 customers * 2 DVDs/customer = 4 DVDs.

Since the last 3 customers purchased 0 DVDs, we don't need to include them in our calculation.

Now, we add the total number of DVDs sold to the first two groups: 3 DVDs + 4 DVDs = 7 DVDs.

Therefore, Billy sold a total of 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total length reduction of the candle, we must first calculate the duration of the burning period. The time elapsed from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Given that the candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, we can calculate the total length reduction as follows:

Length reduction = Rate of melting * Time elapsed
= 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
= 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Final answer: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the original price of the book, we can use the formula for calculating the original price after a discount:

Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Rate)

In this case, the discounted price is $19.50 and the discount rate is 25% or 0.25.

Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
= $19.50 / 0.75
= $26

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26."
"To determine the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered, we can start by calculating the total cost of the items other than pizza. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To calculate the total cost of Mishka's clothing items, we can apply the principle of multiplication to find the cost of each category and then sum them up.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 × $16.50 = $49.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 × $22.50 = $67.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 × $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Therefore, Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To determine the total cost of ice cream for Cynthia, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that she consumes one serving per night and there are 60 days, the total number of servings required is 60. 

Dividing the total servings by the servings per carton (15) yields the number of cartons needed: 60 ÷ 15 = 4.

Multiplying the number of cartons by the cost per carton ($4.00) provides the total expenditure: 4 * $4.00 = $16.00.

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To determine the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we can apply basic arithmetic principles. 

First, we calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip: 60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles.

Next, we calculate the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop: 60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles.

Now, we can find the distance between the first and second stops by subtracting the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. However, this would result in a negative value, which is not feasible in this context. 

A more accurate approach is to consider the second stop as the starting point for the calculation. The distance from the second stop to the end of the trip is 15 miles, and the distance from the second stop to the first stop is 20 miles. 

Therefore, the distance between the first and second stops is the sum of these two distances: 15 miles + 20 miles = 35 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the cost of the boots, we can start by finding the total cost of the two pairs of heels. 

Let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, which is $66. The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost five dollars less than the two pairs of heels, we can set up the equation:

B = $99 - $5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

B = $94

Therefore, the cost of the boots is $94.

The final answer is 94."
"To solve this problem, we can utilize the concept of ratios and algebraic equations. Let's represent Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, where x is the common multiplier.

Given that their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combining like terms, we get: 
18x = 162

Dividing both sides by 18, we find: 
x = 162 / 18
x = 9

Now that we have the value of x, we can determine their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To calculate the average guess, we need to first determine the number of jelly beans each person guessed. 

Let's denote the number of jelly beans in the jar as x. The first person guessed 80 jelly beans. The second person guessed 20 more than half of the first person's guess, which is (80/2) + 20 = 50. The third person guessed 25% more than the first person's guess, which is 80 + (0.25 * 80) = 100.

Now, let's add the guesses together: 80 + 50 + 100 = 230.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses: 230 / 3 = 76.67.

The average guess is 76.67."
"To calculate the total hours spent taking care of dogs per week, we can utilize the concept of multiplication and the number of days in a week. 

Given that each dog requires 0.5 hours of care per day, we can multiply the number of dogs (10) by the daily care time (0.5 hours) to determine the daily care time:

10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Next, we multiply the daily care time by the number of days in a week (7) to obtain the total weekly care time:

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of his dogs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides yields:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2 results in:

x = 40

Now that we have found the value of 'x', we can determine the number of gold coins by adding 30 to 'x':

x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of jewels Siobhan has as S, the number of jewels Aaron has as A, and the number of jewels Raymond has as R.

Given information:
1. R = 40 (Raymond has 40 jewels)
2. A = R/2 + 5 (Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels)
3. S = A - 2 (Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron)

We can substitute the value of A from the second equation into the third equation to find S:
S = (R/2 + 5) - 2
S = (40/2 + 5) - 2
S = (20 + 5) - 2
S = 23

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To calculate the total points scored by Mike, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we can multiply 4 by 0.25.

25% of 4 = 0.25 * 4 = 1

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

Total points scored = 4 + 5
= 9

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points."
"To calculate Terry's total yogurt expenditure over 30 days, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we determine the total number of yogurts consumed in 30 days: 2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts.

Next, we establish the cost of a single yogurt by dividing the total cost of a set by the number of yogurts in the set: $5 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt to find the total expenditure: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.

Therefore, Terry's total expenditure on yogurts over 30 days is $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the number of Lego sets John still has, we need to analyze the given information. John initially had 13 Lego sets and sold them for $15 each, resulting in a total of 13 * 15 = $195.

He then spent $20 on 8 video games, leaving him with $5. This means he had $195 - $160 (8 * 20) = $35 left after buying the video games.

Since John had $40 initially and spent $35 on video games, he must have had $40 - $35 = $5 left. However, this $5 is the amount he had after buying the video games, not the amount he has left from the initial 13 Lego sets.

To find the number of Lego sets John still has, we need to consider the fact that he sold all his initial 13 Lego sets. The question, however, does not provide any information about the number of Lego sets he has left. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine the exact number of Lego sets John still has.

However, we can calculate the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets and compare it to the initial amount to verify the information: 13 * 15 = $195. This matches the initial amount, indicating that John indeed sold all his Lego sets.

Since the question asks for the number of Lego sets he still has, and we cannot determine this value from the given information, the correct answer is:

There is not enough information to determine the number of Lego sets John still has."
"To determine John's speed, we can employ the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time. Given that John runs 60 miles in a week and 3 days, we can calculate his daily running time as follows:

Let's denote the time John runs on the first day as 3 hours. Since he runs half as much on the other two days, his running time for those days is 1.5 hours each. 

Total time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate his speed using the formula: Speed = Distance / Time

Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

Therefore, John's speed is 10 miles per hour."
"To determine the total distance Dana can travel in six hours, we must first calculate her running and walking speeds. Given that her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour and it is half of her running speed, we can deduce her running speed as 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we can calculate the time spent on each activity as follows:

Time spent running = 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours
Time spent walking = 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance traveled during each activity:

Distance traveled while running = 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles
Distance traveled while walking = 3 miles/hour * 4 hours = 12 miles

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances traveled while running and walking:

Total distance = 12 miles + 12 miles = 24 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the age of Suzy's iPhone as S, Ben's iPhone as B, and Brandon's iPhone as D.

Given that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, we have:

S = 1

It is also stated that Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so:

B = 2S
B = 2(1)
B = 2

Furthermore, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so:

D = 4B
D = 4(2)
D = 8

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone, we can employ basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone as x. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so the distance with the gemstone is 3x. We know that x = 400 feet. 

Now, we can calculate the distance with the gemstone: 3x = 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

To find the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames, we subtract the distance the dragon can breathe fire (1000 feet) from the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone (1200 feet): 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of pieces taken by the guests, we can utilize the concept of subtraction. The total number of pieces initially set out is the product of the number of pies and the number of pieces per pie, which is 5 * 8 = 40. 

The number of pieces taken by the guests can be found by subtracting the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out: 40 - 14 = 26.

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the number of grams of chips you can eat, we need to calculate the remaining calories in your daily target and then divide that by the calories per serving.

First, let's calculate the remaining calories: 2000 (daily calorie target) - 1800 (calories consumed) = 200 calories left.

Next, we'll divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Since each serving is 300g, we'll multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving: 0.8 servings * 300g/serving = 240g.

Therefore, you can eat 240g of chips."
"To calculate Charlie's net profit, we must first determine the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue is calculated by multiplying the number of candles sold by the selling price per candle. In this case, Charlie sells 20 candles at $2.00 each.

Total Revenue = Number of Candles Sold * Price per Candle
Total Revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total Revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax and he used 1 pound, the total cost is the cost of the beeswax and wicks. The cost of the wicks is already included in the initial cost of the pound of beeswax, which is $10.00.

Total Cost = Cost of Beeswax and Wicks
Total Cost = $10.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Net Profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net Profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30."
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we can break down the problem into manageable components.

First, we need to find the number of articles she wrote on each day. On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is equivalent to 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, we can calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles by multiplying the number of articles by the time it takes to write each article (4 hours). 

Total hours = (5 * 4) + (7 * 4) + (14 * 4) 
Total hours = 20 + 28 + 56 
Total hours = 104 

The final answer is: $\boxed{104}$"
"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we can set up an equation based on the information provided.

Let x be the number of Post-it notes in the package. We know that Candice initially had 80 notes in her purse and used 220 notes at work. After purchasing the package, she had 23 notes remaining. Therefore, the total number of notes she had initially is the sum of the notes in the package and the notes she had in her purse, minus the notes she used at work.

We can express this as an equation:

80 + x - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 140 = 23

Adding 140 to both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 163

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 163.

The final answer is: $\boxed{163}$"
"To determine the total amount spent on ties, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of blue ties and the cost of red ties.

First, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. The number of blue ties purchased can be calculated as:

Number of blue ties = Total cost of blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 x Number of blue ties
= 2 x 5
= 10

The cost of a red tie is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie. To calculate the cost of a red tie, we can use the following formula:

Cost of red tie = Cost of blue tie + (Cost of blue tie x 0.5)
= $40 + ($40 x 0.5)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total cost of red ties = Number of red ties x Cost of red tie
= 10 x $60
= $600

Finally, we can calculate the total amount spent on ties by adding the cost of blue ties and the cost of red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total cost of blue ties + Total cost of red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we can utilize the concept of division. Given that the wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long, we can calculate the number of pieces by dividing the total length of the wire (in inches) by the length of each piece.

Let's perform the calculation:

Total length of wire = 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
Length of each piece = 6 inches

Number of pieces = Total length of wire ÷ Length of each piece
= 48 inches ÷ 6 inches
= 8

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To determine the number of unoccupied units in the building, we can employ a straightforward approach. Given that each floor has 8 units and there are 15 floors, the total number of units in the building is calculated as follows:

Total units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can find the number of occupied units by multiplying the total units by 3/4:

Occupied units = Total units * 3/4
Occupied units = 120 * 3/4
Occupied units = 90

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total units:

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Unoccupied units = 30

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine Lloyd's weekly earnings from egg sales, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to establish the number of eggs produced per week. Given that the chickens produce 252 eggs per day, we can multiply this rate by the number of days in a week (7) to obtain the total eggs produced per week:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we must convert the total number of eggs to dozens. We can do this by dividing the total number of eggs by 12:

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Now, we can calculate Lloyd's weekly earnings by multiplying the number of dozen eggs sold by the price per dozen:

147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

Therefore, Lloyd's weekly earnings from egg sales are $294."
"To determine the time it takes for Tom to return, we must first calculate the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Given that his speed is 10 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 10 mph × 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to return, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of toys Uriah needs to remove, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of toys as 'x'. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the total weight of the toys is 0.5x pounds. We know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books. Therefore, the weight of the toys he needs to remove is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

We can set up the equation: 0.5x = 7.5

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.5:
x = 7.5 / 0.5
x = 15

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: 15"
"To determine the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360, and the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480. The total revenue on Friday is $480.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the revenues: $480 (Friday) is greater than $520 (Thursday). The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

Since the mechanic earned less on Friday, the correct answer is not among the options. However, to follow the required format, I will provide the numerical value of the difference in revenue.

The final answer is $40."
"To determine the total number of kittens, we can utilize the concept of multiplication to calculate the number of kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, we can express this relationship as:

Number of Patchy's kittens = 3 * Number of Trixie's kittens
= 3 * 12
= 36

Now, we can add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had to find the total number of kittens:

Total number of kittens = Number of Patchy's kittens + Number of Trixie's kittens
= 36 + 12
= 48

Therefore, the Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To determine the number of bags Jean can fill, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2.

Let's calculate the total cost of a movie outing: $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Now, we'll divide the total amount of money Peter has ($42) by the cost of a single outing ($14):

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of boxes as 'x'. The total weight of the boxes will be 15x pounds, and the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is given as 3755 pounds. The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds.

We can set up the following inequality to represent the situation:

15x + 3755 ≤ 5000

Subtracting 3755 from both sides of the inequality yields:

15x ≤ 1245

Dividing both sides by 15:

x ≤ 83

Since 'x' represents the number of boxes, it must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83.

The final answer is: 83"
"To calculate the final price of Stephen's groceries, we must first determine the total amount of the extra fees. The 25% fee is calculated as 0.25 times the original bill of $40.00, resulting in $10.00. Adding the $3.00 delivery fee, the total extra fees amount to $13.00.

The final price of the groceries can be found by adding the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00. Then, adding the $4.00 tip, the final price is $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To determine the total number of raspberries, we can employ a straightforward approach by adding the number of raspberries in the clusters to the number of individual raspberries.

Let's denote the number of clusters as C and the number of raspberries in each cluster as R. We are given C = 6 and R = 20. The total number of raspberries (T) can be calculated using the formula:

T = C * R + I

where I represents the number of individual raspberries. Substituting the given values, we get:

T = 6 * 20 + 67
T = 120 + 67
T = 187

Therefore, the total number of raspberries is 187."
"To determine the number of good oranges, we must first identify the total number of oranges that are not good. This can be achieved by adding the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges.

Let's calculate the number of unripe oranges: 20% of 25 oranges is equal to 0.20 * 25 = 5 oranges.

Next, we add the number of bad, sour, and unripe oranges: 1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges.

Now, we subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges.

Therefore, the number of good oranges is 17.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To calculate the total amount Janet paid, we need to consider the costs associated with the brooch. The total cost consists of the material cost and the construction cost, which are $500 and $800, respectively. Additionally, she pays 10% of the total cost to insure the brooch.

The total cost of the brooch can be calculated as follows:

Total Cost = Material Cost + Construction Cost
Total Cost = $500 + $800
Total Cost = $1300

The insurance cost is then calculated as 10% of the total cost:

Insurance Cost = 0.10 x Total Cost
Insurance Cost = 0.10 x $1300
Insurance Cost = $130

Therefore, the total amount Janet paid is the sum of the total cost and the insurance cost:

Total Amount Paid = Total Cost + Insurance Cost
Total Amount Paid = $1300 + $130
Total Amount Paid = $1430

The final answer is: $1430"
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the two distinct periods of her employment: the initial 20 years with a fixed annual pension of $50,000, and the subsequent 10 years with a 5% increase in the pension value.

In the first 20 years, Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000. The total amount she receives in this period is:

$50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000

After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension is $1,000,000. So, her annual pension after 20 years is:

$1,000,000 * 5% = $50,000

Since she quits after 30 years, she receives the fixed annual pension for 10 years and the 5% annual pension for 10 years.

The total amount she receives in the remaining 10 years is the sum of the fixed annual pension and the 5% annual pension:

$50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000
$50,000/year * 5% = $2,500/year * 10 years = $25,000
Total amount = $500,000 + $25,000 = $525,000

Now, we calculate the average annual pension by dividing the total amount by the total number of years:

Total amount = $1,000,000 + $525,000 = $1,525,000
Average annual pension = Total amount / Total years = $1,525,000 / 30 years = $50,833.33

The final answer is: $50,833.33"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month for 6 months. This can be calculated as:

140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. The amount of the reduction is 10% of $140, which is:

140 * 0.1 = $14

So, the amount she paid for the second half of the year is:

140 - 14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, she paid:

126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year:

$840 + $756 = $1596

Therefore, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."

First, let's find the amount of gas left in the tank:

Gas left = Total capacity - Gas used
Gas left = 12 gallons - 4 gallons
Gas left = 8 gallons

Now, we can calculate the miles per gallon:

Miles per gallon = Total miles / Gas left
Miles per gallon = 100 miles / 8 gallons
Miles per gallon = 12.5 miles per gallon

The final answer is: $\boxed{12.5}$"
"To calculate the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we can break down the problem into two components: the hours spent watching TV and the hours spent reading.

Let's denote the hours spent watching TV as 't' and the hours spent reading as 'r'. We are given that t = 2 hours and r = t/2 = 1 hour. 

Since Jim spends this amount of time 3 times a week, the total hours spent on TV and reading each week is 3(t + r) = 3(2 + 1) = 9 hours.

To find the total hours spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly hours by 4: 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

Therefore, the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 36 hours.

Each school has two teams, consisting of five players and one coach, resulting in a total of 6 individuals per school. With four schools participating, the total number of people sent can be calculated as follows:

2 teams per school * 5 players per team = 10 players per school
10 players per school * 4 schools = 40 players
1 coach per school * 4 schools = 4 coaches
Total number of people = 40 players + 4 coaches = 44 people

Therefore, the total number of people sent by the schools is 44."
"To determine the total number of gems in the treasure chest, we can use the given information to set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of diamonds as D, rubies as R, and emeralds as E.

We know that the number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds, so we can express this as:

R = D - 35

We are also given that the number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, which can be written as:

E = 2R

Substituting the expression for R from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

E = 2(D - 35)

Now, we are told that the total number of gems is the sum of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:

D + R + E = Total

Substituting the expressions for R and E, we get:

D + (D - 35) + 2(D - 35) = Total

Combine like terms:

4D - 70 = Total

We are given that the number of diamonds is 175, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

4(175) - 70 = Total

700 - 70 = Total

630 = Total

Therefore, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 630."
"To determine the number of teachers, we can utilize the given ratio of students to teachers. The problem states that there are 5 students per teacher. 

Let's denote the number of teachers as 't'. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120. The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is 120 + 60 = 180.

We can set up the equation 5t = 180, where 't' represents the number of teachers. Solving for 't', we get t = 180 / 5 = 36.

Therefore, the number of teachers is 36.

The final answer is 36."
"To determine the initial amount of money Bailey had, we can use the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the initial amount as 'x'. Since Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, the total amount she receives is 5 * 8 = $40. At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. We can set up the equation:

x + 40 = 100

To solve for x, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"To calculate Judy's weekly earnings, we can break down the problem into manageable components. 

First, let's determine the total number of classes she teaches in a week. She teaches 5 classes per weekday, and there are 5 weekdays, resulting in 5 * 5 = 25 classes. Additionally, she teaches 8 classes on Saturday, bringing the total to 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week. With 33 classes and 15 students per class, the total number of students is 33 * 15 = 495.

Finally, we can calculate her weekly earnings by multiplying the total number of students by the charge per student: 495 * $15 = $7425.

"To determine the total number of instructions, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic addition. Given that Recipe 1 has 20 instructions and Recipe 2 has twice as many instructions as Recipe 1, we can express this relationship as a mathematical equation:

Let x be the number of instructions in Recipe 1.
Since Recipe 2 has twice as many instructions as Recipe 1, the number of instructions in Recipe 2 can be represented as 2x.

We are given that Recipe 1 has 20 instructions, so x = 20. Substituting this value into the equation for Recipe 2, we get:

Number of instructions in Recipe 2 = 2x = 2(20) = 40

Now, we can find the total number of instructions by adding the number of instructions in both recipes:

Total instructions = Number of instructions in Recipe 1 + Number of instructions in Recipe 2
= 20 + 40
= 60

Therefore, Kelian has a total of 60 instructions to read to prepare the two dishes."
"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the number of brownies as B and the number of cheesecakes as C. We are given that the price of a brownie is $3 and the price of a cheesecake is $4.

The total amount of money raised from brownies can be represented as 3B, and the total amount of money raised from cheesecakes can be represented as 4C. We are given that B = 43 and C = 23.

To find the total amount of money raised, we can add the two expressions together: 3B + 4C. Substituting the given values, we get:

3(43) + 4(23) = 129 + 92

Using the commutative and associative properties of addition, we can simplify the expression:

129 + 92 = 221

Therefore, the total amount of money Tommy raises is $221."
"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay for the cell phones over 3 months, we can break down the calculation into two components: the principal amount and the interest.

The principal amount for each cell phone is $150, and the interest rate is 2% per month. To calculate the interest, we can use the formula:

Interest = Principal x Rate

In this case, the interest for each cell phone is:

Interest = $150 x 0.02
Interest = $3

Since Shiela bought 5 cell phones, the total interest for all cell phones is:

Total Interest = 5 x $3
Total Interest = $15

The total amount Shiela will pay for each cell phone per month is the sum of the principal and the interest:

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $150 + $3
Total Amount = $153

Since Shiela will pay this amount for 3 months, the total amount she will pay over 3 months is:

Total Amount over 3 months = Total Amount x 3
Total Amount over 3 months = $153 x 3
Total Amount over 3 months = $459

The answer is: $459"
"To calculate Artie's total revenue, we can apply the concept of rounding to the prices of each type of flower and then multiply the quantity sold by the rounded price.

First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:
- Marigolds: $2.74 ≈ $3
- Petunias: $1.87 ≈ $2
- Begonias: $2.12 ≈ $2

Now, we can calculate the total revenue from each type of flower:
- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

To find the total revenue, we add the revenues from each type of flower:
$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

The final answer is: $88"
"To calculate the average square footage of each level of the sandcastle, we can utilize the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Given that the top level has a square footage of 16 and each subsequent level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can express the total square footage as:

Total square footage = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2

This is a geometric series with the first term (a) being 16 and the common ratio (r) being 1/2. The sum of a finite geometric series can be calculated using the formula:

S_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S_n is the sum of the first n terms, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, n = 4, a = 16, and r = 1/2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S_4 = 16 * (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2)
= 16 * (1 - 1/16) / (1/2)
= 16 * (15/16) / (1/2)
= 16 * (15/16) * 2
= 30

Now, to find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

Average = Total square footage / Number of levels
= 30 / 4
= 7.5

Therefore, the average square footage of each level is 7.5 square units."
"To determine the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we can break down the problem into two parts: the initial 180 days and the remaining days.

For the first 180 days, the puppy requires 1 cup of dog food per day. This can be calculated as:

1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

For the remaining days, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days, the puppy requires 2 cups of dog food per day. This can be calculated as:

2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

The total amount of food used in the first year is the sum of these two quantities:

180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags used in the first year is:

550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year."
"To calculate the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between their laundry quantities.

Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as 'D' and the amount of laundry Raymond does as 'R'. We are given that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, which can be expressed as:

R = (1/2)S
R = (1/2)(4D)
R = 2D

We are also given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

400 = 4D
D = 400 / 4
D = 100

Now that we have the value of D, we can find the value of R:

R = 2D
R = 2(100)
R = 200

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:

Difference = R - D
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the more cost-effective option for purchasing 18 flowers, we can calculate the cost per flower for each package size.

For packages of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is:
$\frac{2.50}{3} = \frac{5}{6}$ dollars per flower

For packages of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is:
$\frac{1}{2}$ dollars per flower

Since $\frac{5}{6} > \frac{1}{2}$, the cost per flower for the first option is higher. Therefore, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the better option.

The amount of money saved by buying in packages of 2 for $1 is:
$15 - 9 = 6$

Final answer: $\boxed{6}$"
"To calculate the cost of the grooming after the discount, we can apply the concept of percentage decrease. The discount offered is 30% of the original price. 

Mathematically, this can be represented as: 

Original price - (Discount percentage * Original price)
= $100 - (0.30 * $100)
= $100 - $30
= $70

Therefore, the grooming cost after the discount is $70."
"To determine the amount of water left, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we calculate the total amount of water the two girls received. Since they each received 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can express this as:

(1/6) × 24 = 24/6 = 4 liters

As there are two girls, the total amount of water they received is 4 + 4 = 8 liters.

Next, we subtract the 6 liters the boy received from the total:

24 - 8 - 6 = 10 liters

Therefore, there are 10 liters of water left.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the number of stickers Charlie has left, we can apply the principle of addition and subtraction. 

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers. He then acquired 21 more stickers from a store and received 23 stickers as a birthday gift. This results in a total of 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers.

However, Charlie gave away 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 stickers for a greeting card. To find the remaining number of stickers, we need to subtract the total number of stickers given away and used from the total number of stickers Charlie had. 

The correct calculation is as follows:

54 (total stickers) - 9 (given away) - 28 (used) = 54 - 37 = 17

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left."
"To determine the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we can use the following steps:

Let G represent Grace's weight and A represent Alex's weight. We are given that G = 125 pounds and A = 4G - 2.

We can substitute the value of G into the equation for A: 
A = 4(125) - 2
A = 500 - 2
A = 498 pounds

Now, we can find the combined weight by adding G and A:
Combined weight = G + A
= 125 + 498
= 623 pounds

The final answer is 623."
"To calculate the total number of thorns, we can employ the fundamental principles of combinatorics and multiplication. 

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush to obtain the total number of roses: 3 * 25 = 75.

Next, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose to determine the total number of thorns: 75 * 8 = 600.

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600.

The final answer is: $\boxed{600}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of games lost as x. Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Now that we have found the value of x, we can determine the number of games won by substituting x into the expression x + 8:

Number of games won = x + 8
= 7 + 8
= 15

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the total number of quilt blocks, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Since Gene goes on 4 vacations per year and has been vacationing for 11 years, we can calculate the total number of blocks by multiplying the number of years by the number of vacations per year.

Total number of quilt blocks = Number of years * Number of vacations per year
= 11 years * 4 vacations/year
= 44 quilt blocks

Therefore, Gene has a total of 44 quilt blocks."
"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we can analyze the given information as follows:

Let's denote the duration of the first ring as x. According to the problem, the second ring lasted 3 times as long, so its duration is 3x. The third ring lasted half as long as the second ring, so its duration is (3x)/2.

The total duration of the alarm ringing is the sum of the durations of each ring. We can express this as an equation:

x + 3x + (3x)/2 = total duration

To find the total duration, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 2. We can rewrite the equation as:

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we can apply the concept of compound interest. 

The initial salary is $600, and it increases by 10% every year. We can express this as an exponential function:

Salary = 600 * (1 + 0.10)^n

where n is the number of years.

For the first year, the salary is:
Salary = 600 * (1 + 0.10)^1 = 600 * 1.10 = $660

For the second year, the salary is:
Salary = 660 * (1 + 0.10)^1 = 660 * 1.10 = $726

For the third year, the salary is:
Salary = 726 * (1 + 0.10)^1 = 726 * 1.10 = $798.60

For the fourth year, the salary is:
Salary = 798.60 * (1 + 0.10)^1 = 798.60 * 1.10 = $878.46

For the fifth year, the salary is:
Salary = 878.46 * (1 + 0.10)^1 = 878.46 * 1.10 = $966.30

For the sixth year, the salary is:
Salary = 966.30 * (1 + 0.10)^1 = 966.30 * 1.10 = $1062.93

For the seventh year, the salary is:
Salary = 1062.93 * (1 + 0.10)^1 = 1062.93 * 1.10 = $1169.23

For the eighth year, the salary is:
Salary = 1169.23 * (1 + 0.10)^1 = 1169.23 * 1.10 = $1286.15

For the ninth year, the salary is:
Salary = 1286.15 * (1 + 0.10)^1 = 1286.15 * 1.10 = $1414.77

For the tenth year, the salary is:
Salary = 1414.77 * (1 + 0.10)^1 = 1414.77 * 1.10 = $1556.25

"To determine the number of copies Harald sold, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10x.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 88,000 / 11

x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is: 8,000"
"To determine the number of gift bags needed, we must first calculate the number of guests who will attend. Since 1/4 of the invited guests do not show up, we can find the number of attendees by multiplying the total number of invited guests by 3/4.

Number of attendees = (3/4) * 16
= 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can calculate the total number of gift bags required by multiplying the number of attendees by 0.75.

Total gift bags = 12 * 0.75
= 9

The cost of each gift bag is $2. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of gift bags by the cost per bag.

Total cost = 9 * $2
= $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad required for the picnic, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the amount of potato salad each adult and child will consume. Given that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 pounds of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult, we can express this as a ratio: 1 adult = 10 pounds, and 1 child = 5 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of potato salad required for the adults and children separately. 

Adults: 20 adults * 10 pounds/adult = 200 pounds
Children: 5 children * 5 pounds/child = 25 pounds

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts for adults and children: 200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to ensure everyone has enough to eat.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To determine the total number of pets the three individuals have, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of pets Cindy has as 'c', Marcia has as 'm', and Jan has as 'j'. We are given that Cindy has 4 pets, so c = 4.

We are also given that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, which can be expressed as m = c + 2. Substituting c = 4 into this equation, we get m = 4 + 2 = 6.

Furthermore, Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, which can be expressed as j = 3m. Substituting m = 6 into this equation, we get j = 3(6) = 18.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: total = c + m + j = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28.

Therefore, the total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the ages of the siblings. Let's denote the age of Jackson as J, Amy as A, Corey as C, and James as M.

We are given the following information:

1. M = C - 1 (James is 1 year younger than Corey)
2. M = 10 (James is 10 years old)
3. C = M + 1 (Corey is 1 year older than James)
4. A = C - 5 (Amy is 5 years older than Corey)

"To solve this problem, we can apply the concept of percentage increase to find Gerald's new time. 

Let's denote Gerald's original time as x. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation: 
Lee's time = Gerald's time + 2
38 = x + 2

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 38 - 2
x = 36

Since Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%, we can calculate his new time by dividing his original time by 1.1 (100% + 10% improvement):
Gerald's new time = x / 1.1
Gerald's new time = 36 / 1.1
Gerald's new time = 32.73

Therefore, Gerald's new time is 32.73 seconds.

The final answer is 32.73."
"To determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of dogs as D and the number of cats as C. We are given that D = 60 and C = 2D.

The number of rabbits (R) is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so we can express this relationship as:

R = D + C - 12

Substituting the given values, we get:

R = 60 + 2(60) - 12
R = 60 + 120 - 12
R = 168

Now, to find the total number of pets, we simply add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = D + C + R
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"To determine the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to calculate the total number of girls in the class. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls.

Let's calculate the number of girls:

Total students = 200
Number of boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we need to find 2/3 of the girls to determine how many are in the girl scout:

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40."
"To determine the difference in hours slept between Harry and James, we can use the concept of proportional reasoning. Since James slept 2/3 of the hours Harry slept, we can set up a proportion to find the number of hours James slept.

Let x be the number of hours James slept. The proportion can be set up as follows:

2/3 = x / 9

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2 * 9 = 3x
18 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3:

x = 18 / 3
x = 6

So, James slept 6 hours.

To find the difference in hours slept between Harry and James, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept:

9 - 6 = 3

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To determine the number of tomatoes used, we can start by recognizing that the sauce made 32 ounces, which is half the volume of the tomatoes. This implies that the total volume of tomatoes used is twice the volume of the sauce, so we can calculate the total ounces of tomatoes used as follows:

Total ounces of tomatoes = 2 * 32 ounces
Total ounces of tomatoes = 64 ounces

Since each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces, we can find the number of cans used by dividing the total ounces of tomatoes by 16:

Number of cans = Total ounces of tomatoes / 16
Number of cans = 64 / 16
Number of cans = 4

Finally, since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can find the total number of tomatoes used by multiplying the number of cans by 3:

Total tomatoes = Number of cans * 3
Total tomatoes = 4 * 3
Total tomatoes = 12

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"To determine the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as x.

We know that the total number of cars is 30, and 5 cars took an exit. So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is x + 20.

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 25

Solving for x, we get:

x = 25 - 20
x = 5

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of potted plants she initially possesses. Since she has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, we can express this as a multiplication operation:

2 * 40 = 80

Next, we need to account for the plants she will give away. She will distribute 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, resulting in a total of 40 plants given away.

To find the remaining number of potted plants, we subtract the number of plants given away from the initial total:

80 - 40 = 40

Therefore, Mary will have 40 potted plants left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we can analyze the given information and apply basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the number of doorbell rings for each friend as follows:
- Fourth friend: 60
- Third friend: 60 + 10 = 70
- Second friend: 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25
- First friend: 20

Now, we can calculate the total number of doorbell rings by adding the individual counts:
Total = 60 + 70 + 25 + 20
Total = 175

Therefore, the total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To determine the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we can calculate the sum of the pages from all the textbooks:

4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total:

39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read

To find the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

Therefore, Solo needs to read 6 pages per day to complete his reading within the given timeframe."
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

Let's break down John's water consumption into two categories: weekdays and weekends. On weekdays, John consumes 3 glasses of water per day, and there are 5 weekdays. Therefore, the total number of glasses of water consumed on weekdays is 3 * 5 = 15.

On weekends, John consumes 2 glasses of water per day, and there are 2 weekend days. Hence, the total number of glasses of water consumed on weekends is 2 * 2 = 4.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the number of glasses consumed on weekdays and weekends: 15 + 4 = 19.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the time it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can apply the concept of unit rates. The given information states that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We can express this as a unit rate of 3 miles per 10 minutes.

To find the time it takes to cover 42 miles, we can set up a proportion:

(3 miles / 10 minutes) = (42 miles / x minutes)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

3x = 42 * 10
3x = 420

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 420 / 3
x = 140

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

Final answer: 140"
"To determine the number of jigsaw pieces left, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of pieces Poppy places on the board, which is one-fourth of the total: $\frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250$ pieces.

Next, we find the remaining pieces by subtracting the pieces placed by Poppy from the total: $1000 - 250 = 750$ pieces.

Then, we calculate the number of pieces her mom places on the board, which is one-third of the remaining pieces: $\frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250$ pieces.

Finally, we find the number of pieces left by subtracting the pieces placed by her mom from the remaining pieces: $750 - 250 = 500$ pieces.

Therefore, there are 500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{500}$"
"To determine the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Given that Cody consumes three times as many cookies as Amir, we can express this relationship as a ratio: 3:1. Since Amir consumes 5 cookies, we can calculate Cody's cookie consumption by multiplying Amir's consumption by 3.

Cody's cookie consumption = 3 × Amir's cookie consumption
= 3 × 5
= 15 cookies

Now, we can find the total number of cookies eaten by both individuals by adding their respective consumptions:

Total cookies = Cody's cookie consumption + Amir's cookie consumption
= 15 + 5
= 20 cookies

Therefore, the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir is 20."
"To calculate the total inner volume of the boxes, we must first determine the inner dimensions of each box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from the outer dimensions to obtain the inner dimensions.

The inner dimensions of each box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the box) is given by the formula:
V = Length x Width x Height

Substituting the inner dimensions, we get:
V = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total Volume = 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can start by calculating the total time spent watching TV on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes, totaling 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

The total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent watching on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

To convert 1.5 hours to minutes, we multiply by 60: 1.5 × 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we can determine the number of 30-minute episodes by dividing 90 minutes by 30 minutes: 90 ÷ 30 = 3.

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

This year, he wants to make twice as many cookies, so he bakes 2x cookies. However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, resulting in a total of 2x + 15 cookies.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left, which simplifies to 2x + 10.

We are given that he has a total of 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides yields:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we can employ the concept of a discount. The cashback amount can be viewed as a reduction in the total cost of the gas.

Total cost of gas = Number of gallons * Price per gallon
Total cost of gas = 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon
Total cost of gas = $30.00

Cashback amount = Number of gallons * Cashback per gallon
Cashback amount = 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon
Cashback amount = $2.00

Total cost after cashback = Total cost of gas - Cashback amount
Total cost after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00
Total cost after cashback = $28.00

Therefore, the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards will be $28.00."
"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten, we must first calculate the total number of roll-ups consumed by both Marcell and Beatrice.

Let's denote the number of roll-ups Beatrice ate as B and the number Marcell ate as M. We are given that Beatrice's roll-ups were 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls up long, while Marcell's were 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls up long. 

We can express the total number of roll-ups as the product of the width and length for each individual, then sum these values to find the total. 

The total number of roll-ups is given by: 
Total = (2 * 24) + (3 * 14)

Using the distributive property, we can simplify this expression:
Total = 48 + 42

Now, we can calculate the total number of roll-ups:
Total = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can divide the total by 2 to find the average number of roll-ups eaten:
Average = Total / 2
Average = 90 / 2
Average = 45

The average number of fruit roll-ups eaten is 45."
"To solve this problem, we can employ the concept of related rates and unit conversion. 

First, we need to establish the rate at which Julia's boat is taking on water. Given that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can express this as a rate of 0.2 liters per foot.

Next, we can calculate Julia's rowing speed. We know that she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so her speed is 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Now, we can find the total distance Julia rows to reach the shore, which is 64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet.

Finally, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on by the boat:

Total water taken on = Rate of water intake * Distance
= 0.2 liters/foot * 80 feet
= 16 liters

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can apply the fundamental principles of arithmetic operations. 

Given that there are 4 teachers, each using the whiteboard for 2 lessons per day, and the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, we can calculate the total number of cleanings as follows:

Total number of cleanings = Number of teachers × Number of lessons per day × Number of cleanings per lesson
= 4 × 2 × 3
= 24

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"To determine the total number of flowers Ryan has after 15 days, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic sequences. Since Ryan plants 2 flowers per day, the total number of flowers can be calculated as follows:

Total flowers = 2 * 15
Total flowers = 30

However, we are also given that 5 flowers did not grow. To find the actual number of flowers Ryan has, we need to subtract the non-growing flowers from the total:

Actual flowers = Total flowers - Non-growing flowers
Actual flowers = 30 - 5
Actual flowers = 25

Therefore, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden after 15 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of ducks as 'x'. According to the problem, Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, and Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. This allows us to set up the equation:

6 * (50 * x) = 1800

Simplifying the equation, we get:

300x = 1800

Dividing both sides by 300, we find:

x = 1800 / 300
x = 6

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

"To calculate the profit, we need to determine the total cost and total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

Next, calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, add the total cost of both types of boards:
$100 + $80 = $180

The prices have increased by 50%, so the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
10 boards * $15 per board = $150

Calculate the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
5 boards * $24 per board = $120

Now, add the total revenue from both types of boards:
$150 + $120 = $270

To find the profit, subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
$270 - $180 = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio of 7:13. Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as 'x'. Since the total amount of water is not required, we can directly focus on the sugar.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, and the total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20. We know that the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons. 

We can set up the following proportion:

7/20 = x/120

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

7 * 120 = 20x
840 = 20x

Now, divide both sides by 20:

x = 840 / 20
x = 42

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar."

"To calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find Adrien's current salary. Since his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can calculate 30% of his old salary and add it to his old salary.

Adrien's old salary = $40,000
30% of Adrien's old salary = 0.3 * $40,000 = $12,000
Adrien's current salary = $40,000 + $12,000 = $52,000

Next, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769.23

Now, we need to find Lylah's current salary. Since her salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate 40% of her old salary and add it to her old salary.

40% of Lylah's old salary = 0.4 * $30,769.23 = $12,307.69
Lylah's current salary = $30,769.23 + $12,307.69 = $43,076.92

Finally, we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their current salaries.

Total salary = Adrien's current salary + Lylah's current salary
Total salary = $52,000 + $43,076.92
Total salary = $95,076.92

The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is $95,076.92."
"To determine the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to establish the number of weeks in a month, which is typically 4 weeks. Then, we multiply the number of pads used per week by the number of weeks in a month:

2 pads/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 pads/month

Since there are 30 sheets of paper in a pad, we can calculate the total number of sheets used per month by multiplying the number of pads used per month by the number of sheets per pad:

8 pads/month * 30 sheets/pad = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"To determine the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael have, we can break down their contributions and calculate the sum.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so the total number of fruits she brought is 5 + 8 = 13.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples, which is 2 × 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges, which is 8 ÷ 2 = 4 oranges. So, the total number of fruits Kael brought is 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, let's add the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought: 13 + 14 = 27.

Therefore, the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael have is 27."
"To calculate the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we can break down the problem into individual days and sum the hours.

Let's denote the hours slept on Monday as M, Tuesday as T, Wednesday as W, Thursday as Th, Friday as Fr, Saturday as Sa, and Sunday as Su.

Given:
M = 8
T = M - 2
W = T - 2
Th = W + 1
Fr = Th + 1
Sa = Fr + 1
Su = Sa + 1

We can express the total hours slept as the sum of the hours slept each day:
Total hours = M + T + W + Th + Fr + Sa + Su

Substituting the expressions for each day in terms of M:
Total hours = M + (M - 2) + ((M - 2) - 2) + ((M - 2) + 1) + ((M - 2) + 1) + ((M - 2) + 1) + ((M - 2) + 1)

Simplifying the expression:
Total hours = M + M - 2 + M - 4 + M - 3 + M - 1 + M - 1 + M - 1 + M + 1
Total hours = 7M - 10

Now, we can substitute the value of M (8 hours) into the expression:
Total hours = 7(8) - 10
Total hours = 56 - 10
Total hours = 46

The final answer is: $\boxed{46}$"
"To determine the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we can break down the problem into two parts: the initial 3 hours at 10 miles per hour and the remaining 4 hours at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance covered during the initial 3 hours at 10 miles per hour:

Distance = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

Next, we'll calculate the distance covered during the remaining 4 hours at 5 miles per hour:

Distance = Speed × Time = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles

Now, we'll add the distances covered in both periods to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:

Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.

Final answer: 50"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters as x.

We know that Jennie stamped one-third of the letters needing stamps, which is 60 letters. This means she stamped 60 / 3 = 20 letters. The remaining letters, which were already stamped, are x.

After stamping 20 letters, the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters becomes x + 20. We are given that this total is 30.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 20 = 30

Solving for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation: x = 30 - 20
x = 10

Therefore, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is 10.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia initially bought as x. We know that her husband gave her 5 spoons, and she used 3 spoons to sample her stew. Therefore, the total number of spoons she had at the end is x + 5 - 3.

We are given that the total number of spoons at the end is 12. We can set up the equation:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:

x = 10

Therefore, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic addition. Given that the number of fish sausages is 6 more than the number of chicken sausages, we can express this relationship as:

Number of fish sausages = Number of chicken sausages + 6

Let's denote the number of chicken sausages as C. Then, the number of fish sausages can be represented as C + 6.

The total number of sausages is the sum of chicken and fish sausages, which can be calculated as:

Total number of sausages = C + (C + 6)

Combining like terms, we get:

Total number of sausages = 2C + 6

We are given that the number of chicken sausages is 38. Substituting this value into the equation, we can calculate the total number of sausages:

Total number of sausages = 2(38) + 6
Total number of sausages = 76 + 6
Total number of sausages = 82

Therefore, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages."
"To determine the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together, we can utilize the concept of addition. 

Given that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, we can express this relationship as an equation: 

Let's denote the number of friends Lily has as L and the number of friends Amy has as A. We know that A = L + 20. 

We are also given that L = 50. Substituting this value into the equation A = L + 20, we get A = 50 + 20 = 70.

Therefore, the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together is 120."
"To determine the total cost of the items Dillon is purchasing, we can break down the costs of each item and calculate the total.

First, we know that a pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dillon is buying:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To calculate the profit made by the hospital, we need to consider the total revenue generated from both the patients and the doctors, as well as the time spent on patients.

First, let's calculate the total time spent on patients. With 500 patients seen per day, each taking 24 minutes, the total time spent is:

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Converting this to hours, we get:

12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour, so the total revenue from patients is:

500 patients * $200/patient = $100,000

The doctors charge $150 per hour, and with 200 hours of work, the total revenue from doctors is:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from patients and doctors:

$100,000 + $30,000 = $130,000

Since there are no costs mentioned, the profit is simply the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $130,000 - $0 = $130,000

The hospital makes a profit of $130,000."
"To determine the number of elves left, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. Initially, Nissa hires 60 elves. A third of these elves quit due to children vomiting on them, which equates to 60 / 3 = 20 elves. 

The remaining elves are 60 - 20 = 40. Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins, leaving 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30."
"To calculate the total expenditure, we can simply add the expenditures for May and June. 

Expenditure in May = $500
Expenditure in June = $500 - $60 = $440

= $940

Therefore, the total expenditure for those two months is $940."
"To determine the total number of tickets used, we can break down the problem into two parts: the roller coaster rides and the luge rides.

First, let's calculate the total number of tickets used for the roller coaster rides. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, and each ride costs 6 tickets. Therefore, the total number of tickets used for the roller coaster rides is 2 * 6 = 12.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of tickets used for the luge rides. Both Pam and Fred rode the luge 2 times, so the total number of tickets used for the luge rides is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.

Now, we can find the total number of tickets used by adding the tickets used for the roller coaster rides and the luge rides: 12 + 8 = 20.

Therefore, the total number of tickets used that day is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the miles walked on Wednesday, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the miles walked on Monday as M, the miles walked on Tuesday as T, and the miles walked on Wednesday as W.

We know that M = 4 (given miles walked on Monday) and T = 6M (since Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as on Monday).

The total miles walked from Monday through Wednesday is given as 41. We can express this as an equation: M + T + W = 41.

Substituting the values of M and T, we get:
4 + 6(4) + W = 41

Simplifying the equation:
4 + 24 + W = 41
28 + W = 41

Subtracting 28 from both sides:
W = 41 - 28
W = 13

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To calculate the total annual cost of car washes, we can utilize the formula for calculating total cost, which is the product of the number of car washes per month and the cost per car wash, multiplied by the number of months in a year.

We are given that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. This relationship can be expressed as:

x = 3B - 5

We also know that Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so his current number of video games is:

B = 20 - 5
B = 15

Now, we can substitute the value of B into the equation:

x = 3(15) - 5
x = 45 - 5
x = 40

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games.

"To determine the number of female Scottish unicorns, we can apply a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to find the total number of Scottish unicorns, which is one-third of the global population. This can be calculated as:

Total Scottish unicorns = (1/3) * Total global unicorns
Total Scottish unicorns = (1/3) * 27
Total Scottish unicorns = 9

Since two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns as:

Number of female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) * Total Scottish unicorns
Number of female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) * 9
Number of female Scottish unicorns = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns."
"To calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we can break down the costs as follows:

The cost of the subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00.
The cost of the chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00.
The cost of the cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00.

The subtotal for the order is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

A 20% delivery fee is applied to the subtotal, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00.

The total cost with the delivery fee is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Adding a $5.00 tip to the total cost results in $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

Therefore, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is $29.00."
"To determine the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we can calculate the total number of questions he completed and subtract it from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test, Mark completed 5 questions per hour for 8 hours, resulting in a total of 5 * 8 = 40 questions completed. The test had 75 questions, so the number of questions left incomplete is 75 - 40 = 35.

For the second test, Mark completed 5 questions per hour for 6 hours, resulting in a total of 5 * 6 = 30 questions completed. The test had 100 questions, so the number of questions left incomplete is 100 - 30 = 70.

To find the total number of questions left incomplete, we add the number of questions left incomplete from each test: 35 + 70 = 105.

Therefore, Mark left 105 questions incomplete.

"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we can utilize the concept of proportions. Given that the total number of cars is 20, and the sum of automatic and manual cars is 12 + 4 = 16, the number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as:

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we can divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of babies as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as babies, so we can express this relationship as W = 2B. Additionally, there are twice as many babies as queens, which can be represented as B = 2Q.

We can substitute the expression for B into the equation for W, yielding W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

The total number of bees is 700, so we can set up the equation: Q + B + W = 700. Substituting the expressions for B and W, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combining like terms, we have 7Q = 700. Solving for Q, we find Q = 700 / 7 = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"

"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the tax on non-food items. The tax rate is 10% of the total cost of non-food items. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total non-food items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Next, we'll calculate the tax on non-food items: 10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

Now, we'll add the tax to the total cost of non-food items: $10 + $1 = $11

The total cost of non-food items with tax is $11.

The total cost of food items is the sum of the costs of milk and eggs: $2 + $3 = $5

Finally, we'll add the total cost of non-food items with tax and the total cost of food items to get the overall total cost: $11 + $5 = $16

The final answer is: $16"
"To calculate Kim's profit, we must first determine the total expenses. The cost of bleach and cloths can be calculated as follows:

Let's denote the number of clients as 'n'. Since each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, the total number of bleach bottles and cloths required is 2n and n, respectively. The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, and the cost of cloths is $5 per pack.

The total cost of bleach is 2n * $2 = $4n.
The total cost of cloths is n * $5 = $5n.

The total expenses are the sum of the cost of bleach and cloths: $4n + $5n = $9n.

Given that Kim has 3 initial clients and 5 potential clients, the total number of clients is 3 + 5 = 8. Therefore, n = 8.

Substituting n = 8 into the total expenses equation, we get:
Total expenses = $9n = $9 * 8 = $72.

Kim's total income is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per year. Given that John has 10 hectares of pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare, we can calculate the total number of pineapples per year as follows:

10 hectares/year * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples/year

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we can multiply the total number of pineapples per year by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year):

1000 pineapples/year * 4 = 4000 pineapples/year

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"
"To determine the total number of Lego pieces Johnny needs to pick up, we can calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

Let's denote the number of pieces in the first box as x. We know that the second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, so its number of pieces is 3x. The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first box, so its number of pieces is (1/4)x.

We are given that the first box has 500 pieces, so x = 500. Now we can calculate the number of pieces in each box:

Number of pieces in the first box: 500
Number of pieces in the second box: 3x = 3(500) = 1500
Number of pieces in the third box: (1/4)x = (1/4)(500) = 125

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box:
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

Therefore, Johnny needs to pick up a total of 2125 Lego pieces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2125}$"
"To determine the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours, we can break down the problem into distinct phases.

Let's denote the initial number of bees that leave the hive in the first 6 hours as x. We are given that x = 30.

In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return, which is (1/2)x = (1/2)(30) = 15 bees.

In the subsequent 6 hours, 2 times as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2x = 2(30) = 60 bees.

The total number of bees that left before the last 6 hours is x + 2x = 3x = 3(30) = 90 bees.

In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return to the hive. Since 15 bees returned in the previous 6 hours, the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 90 - 15 = 75 bees.

Therefore, the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 75.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of adult tickets as A and the number of child tickets as C. We know that the total cost of the tickets is $12A + $10C. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, we can substitute A = 1 and C = 1 into the equation.

The total cost of the tickets is $12(1) + $10(1) = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change, which is $22 + $8 = $30.

Therefore, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To determine the number of Facebook friends James has, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the number of friends each individual has. 

Let's denote the number of friends Dorothy has as 'D' and the number of friends Charlie has as 'C'. We are given that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, which can be expressed as:

C = 3D

We are also given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

12 = 3D

To solve for D, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

D = 12 / 3
D = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4, as James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:

James' friends = 4D
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the time Tim will be waiting for Steve, we must first calculate the time it takes for each individual to complete the race.

Steve's time can be calculated by dividing the distance to his home (3 miles) by his speed (440 feet/minute). We'll convert the distance to feet: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet. Then, we can calculate Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes.

Similarly, Tim's time can be calculated by dividing the distance to his home (2 miles) by his speed (264 feet/minute): 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet. Then, we can calculate Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes.

Since Steve finishes first, we can find the time Tim will be waiting by subtracting Steve's time from Tim's time: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to consider the number of tires inflated and the cost per tire. 

First, we calculate the total number of tires inflated: 
5 bicycles with 2 tires each contribute 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
3 tricycles with 3 tires each contribute 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
1 unicycle contributes 1 tire.

The total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents, we can calculate the total amount of money made by multiplying the total number of tires by the cost per tire: 20 * 0.25 = $5.

Therefore, Shawnda made $5 that day."
"To calculate the change Carl receives after purchasing 10 packs of cookies, we can employ the concept of unitary method. 

First, we determine the total cost of the cookies by multiplying the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack and then by the cost per cookie:

Total cost = (Number of packs) × (Cookies per pack) × (Cost per cookie)
Total cost = 10 × 6 × $0.10
Total cost = $6

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, we can find the change by subtracting the total cost from the $10 bill:

Change = $10 - $6
Change = $4

Therefore, Carl receives $4 as change.

The final answer is: $4"
"The problem at hand involves a series of sequential events that affect the quantity of french fries in a pack. To determine the initial quantity, we can employ a step-by-step approach, utilizing basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the initial quantity of french fries as 'x'. The sequence of events can be represented as follows:

1. A raccoon steals 2/3 of the remaining fries, leaving 1/3 of the original amount, which is equal to 5 fries. This can be expressed as:

(1/3)x = 5

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 3:

x = 5 * 3

2. Three pigeons eat 3 fries each, resulting in a total of 9 fries being consumed. The remaining fries are then 15 - 9 = 6.

3. A seagull eats half of the fries that Dave initially ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. The remaining fries after the seagull's consumption are 6 - 7 = -1. However, since we cannot have a negative quantity of fries, this indicates an error in the initial assumption. We must re-evaluate the sequence.

Revisiting the sequence, we realize that the seagull ate half of the fries that Dave initially ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. The remaining fries after the seagull's consumption are 6 - 7 = -1. This discrepancy suggests that the initial quantity 'x' should be reevaluated.

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we can break down his class schedule into two components: the number of hours he spends in classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and the number of hours he spends in classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

Let's calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes on each type of day. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day, resulting in a total of 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day, resulting in a total of 2 * 2 = 4 hours per week.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, we can multiply the number of hours Kimo spends in classes per week by the number of weeks to find the total number of hours he spends in classes per semester. 

Total hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays = 9 hours/week * 16 weeks = 144 hours
Total hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays = 4 hours/week * 16 weeks = 64 hours

The total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is the sum of these two values: 144 hours + 64 hours = 208 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{208}$"
"To determine the total length of the baked goods, we can calculate the length of each type of baked good and add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the rolls to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the rolls by dividing by 12:

300 rolls * 4 inches/roll / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

Next, we'll convert the length of the croissants to feet:

120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

Finally, we'll calculate the total length of the baguettes:

60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, we can add the lengths of all the baked goods together:

10 feet (rolls) + 10 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 140 feet

Therefore, the total length of the baked goods is 140 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we must consider the monthly consumption of each ape species and then calculate the total requirement.

Let's break down the monthly consumption of each species:

- Monkeys: 200 bananas per month
- Gorillas: 400 bananas per month
- Baboons: 100 bananas per month

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to calculate the total requirement for 2 months. To do this, we'll multiply the monthly consumption of each species by 2.

Total bananas for monkeys: 200 * 2 = 400 bananas
Total bananas for gorillas: 400 * 2 = 800 bananas
Total bananas for baboons: 100 * 2 = 200 bananas

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas required:
400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine the winner of the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake's distance can be calculated as 2 * 15 * 100 yards, since he runs back and forth 15 times. This simplifies to 3000 yards.

Kelly's distance can be calculated as 2 * 100 yards + 2 * 80 yards * 34, since she runs back and forth once and then to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. This simplifies to 200 + 5440 yards = 5640 yards.

Since 5640 yards is greater than 3000 yards, Kelly wins.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 5640 - 3000 = 2640 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2640}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Raphael's school supplies, we can apply the principle of arithmetic addition. 

First, we'll calculate the total cost of the pens: 4 pens × $1.5 per pen = $6.

Next, we'll calculate the total cost of the notebooks: 2 notebooks × $4 per notebook = $8.

Lastly, we'll add the cost of the bond paper: $20.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Therefore, Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"To determine the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond, we can apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

Initially, Finn observed 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 tadpoles emerged from under a lily pad, and 2 tadpoles hid under a rock. To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the total number of tadpoles initially observed.

Let's denote the initial number of tadpoles as N, the number of tadpoles that emerged as E, and the number of tadpoles that hid as H. We are given N = 11, E = 6, and H = 2.

The number of tadpoles Finn can see is given by the formula: N - E + H (since the tadpoles that hid are not visible).

Substituting the given values, we get: 11 - 6 + 2 = 7

Therefore, Finn can see 7 tadpoles in the pond.

Final answer: 7"
"To determine the water depth in the tank on Wednesday, we can apply the concept of proportional relationships. Given that the depth on Wednesday is two thirds of the depth on Tuesday, we can express this as a fraction:

Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * Depth on Tuesday

We are given that the depth on Tuesday is 24 feet. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * 24
Depth on Wednesday = (2 * 24) / 3
Depth on Wednesday = 48 / 3
Depth on Wednesday = 16

Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

Final answer: 16"
"To determine the total number of fish caught, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of starfish caught by Anakin as A, the number of sea horses as S, and the number of clownfish as C. We know that Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish, 3 fewer sea horses, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin.

We can represent Locsin's catch as (A - 5), (S - 3), and (C + 2).

Since we know Anakin's catch, we can substitute the values into the equations:
A = 10
S = 6
C = 3

Now, we can set up the equations for Locsin's catch:
A - 5 = 5 (starfish)
S - 3 = 3 (sea horses)
C + 2 = 5 (clownfish)

Solving these equations, we get:
A - 5 = 5 => A = 10
S - 3 = 3 => S = 6
C + 2 = 5 => C = 3

Now, we can calculate the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: A + S + C = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: (A - 5) + (S - 3) + (C + 2) = (10 - 5) + (6 - 3) + (3 + 2) = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

The total number of fish caught is the sum of their individual catches: 19 + 13 = 32.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To calculate the price of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The price increases by 20% every 2 months, which can be represented as a geometric sequence.

The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:

an = a1 * (1 + r)^(n-1)

where:
- an is the nth term
- a1 is the initial term (the initial price of the bag of marbles, $20)
- r is the common ratio (1 + 20% = 1.20)
- n is the number of terms

We want to find the price after 36 months, so n = 36. Plugging in the values, we get:

a36 = 20 * (1.20)^(36-1)
a36 = 20 * (1.20)^35
a36 = 20 * 5.059
a36 ≈ 100.98

However, since the price must be a whole number, we can round it to the nearest cent.

The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $100.98.

The final answer is: $100.98"
"To determine the total cost of all toys, we can utilize the given information to establish a system of equations. Let's denote the cost of an action figure as A, the cost of a red car as R, and the cost of the doll as D.

We are provided with the following information:
1. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so D = 3A.
2. One red car costs $4, so R = $4.
3. The cost of an action figure is $5, so A = $5.

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation D = 3A to find the cost of the doll:
D = 3 * $5
D = $15

Next, we can find the total cost of all toys by adding the cost of each item:
Total cost = (5 red cars * $4) + (3 action figures * $5) + (1 doll * $15)
Total cost = (5 * $4) + (3 * $5) + $15
Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15
Total cost = $50

Therefore, the total cost of all toys is $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the difference in earnings between doing taxes oneself and hiring an accountant, we can calculate the lost income from doing taxes oneself and subtract the cost of hiring the accountant.

The lost income from doing taxes oneself is calculated as the number of hours lost multiplied by the hourly wage: 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

The difference in earnings is the lost income minus the cost of hiring the accountant: $105 - $90 = $15.

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

Final answer: $15"
"To determine the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the accessories she purchased. This can be achieved by summing the individual costs of the items.

The total cost of the accessories is calculated as follows:

Total Cost = Cost of Computer + Cost of Scanner + Cost of CD Burner + Cost of Printer
Total Cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102
Total Cost = €1423

Given that Elvira's budget is €1500, we can find the amount of money she will have left for her clothing by subtracting the total cost from her budget:

Remaining Amount = Budget - Total Cost
Remaining Amount = €1500 - €1423
Remaining Amount = €77

Therefore, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

77"

We can set up the division problem as follows:

15 ÷ 3 = ?

This can be calculated as:

15 ÷ 3 = 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to obtain the required 15 eggs.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Seth's current age as x. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Brooke's current age can be represented as x/2.

In 2 years, Seth's age will be x + 2, and Brooke's age will be x/2 + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 + x/2 + 2 = 28

To simplify the equation, we can first combine like terms:

(3x/2) + 4 = 28

Subtracting 4 from both sides yields:

3x/2 = 24

Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:

3x = 48

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 16

Therefore, Seth's current age is 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine Jimmy's total amount of money, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Ethel's money as E and Jimmy's money as J. We are given that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the amount of money Ethel has, which can be expressed as:

J = 2E + 2

We are also given that Ethel has $8, so E = $8. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

J = 2($8) + 2
J = $16 + 2
J = $18

Therefore, Jimmy has $18.

The final answer is $18."
"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic series. 

Let's break down the problem into two parts: weekdays and weekends. 

The number of weekdays is 5, and the miles walked on each weekday is 20. The number of weekends is 2, and the miles walked on each weekend day is 10.

We can calculate the total miles walked on weekdays as 5 * 20 = 100 miles. Similarly, the total miles walked on weekends is 2 * 10 = 20 miles.

To find the total miles walked in a week, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

Therefore, the total miles Pancho walks in a week is 120 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we can break down the costs as follows:

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 × $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, which is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
$25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To calculate the total number of legs, we can employ the principle of arithmetic summation. Let's break down the calculation:

First, we'll calculate the total number of legs for each type of creature:

- Spiders: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs
- Insects: 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs
- Mutant invertebrates: 3 mutant invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs

Now, we'll add these values together to obtain the total number of legs:

Total legs = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To determine the total age of the four birds, we can analyze the given information using algebraic expressions.

Let's denote the age of Sally Four as S4, Granny Red as GR, Sally Two as ST, and Sally Thirty-two as ST32. We are given the following relationships:

1. ST32 = 8
2. S4 = ST32 (since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two)
3. GR = 2 * S4 (Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four)
4. ST = GR + 3 (Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red)

We can substitute the values of S4 and GR using the first and third equations:

GR = 2 * S4
GR = 2 * 8
GR = 16

Now, we can find the age of Sally Two:

ST = GR + 3
ST = 16 + 3
ST = 19

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

Total Age = S4 + GR + ST + ST32
Total Age = 8 + 16 + 19 + 8
Total Age = 51

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine Jessica's annual debt payment, we must first calculate her monthly payment, which consists of the sum of the minimum payments for her student loans, credit card, and mortgage. 

Let's denote the minimum payment for each debt as follows:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

The total minimum payment is the sum of these individual payments:
Total minimum payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 x $1000 = $500

Now, we add the 50% increase to the total minimum payment to find Jessica's new monthly payment:
$1000 + $500 = $1500

To find the annual payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
$1500 x 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To calculate the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we can use the formula:

Time = (Number of potatoes * Time to peel one potato) + (Number of potatoes * Time to cut one potato)

Given:
Number of potatoes = 60
Time to peel one potato = 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato = 5 seconds

First, convert the time to peel one potato to seconds: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds

Now, convert the time to cut one potato to seconds: 5 seconds

Time = (60 * 90) + (60 * 5)
Time = 5400 + 300
Time = 5700 seconds

To convert the total time back to minutes, divide by 60: 5700 / 60 = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy approximately 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

Final answer: 95"
"To determine the cost of lemons, we can start by calculating the total revenue and total cost.

The revenue per gallon is $10, and they made a profit of $25. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Revenue - Cost = Profit
$10 - Cost = $25

To isolate the cost, we can add $10 to both sides of the equation:

$10 + $25 = $35

This represents the total cost for 1 gallon. Since they need lemons and sugar for each gallon, the cost of lemons and sugar for 1 gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

To find the cost of lemons, we can divide the total cost by 1 gallon:

Cost of lemons = Total cost / 1 gallon
= $35 / 1 gallon
= $35 per gallon

Therefore, the cost of lemons is $35.

The final answer is: $35"
"To determine the number of Chinese girls, we must first calculate the total number of Chinese participants. This can be achieved by subtracting the number of Japanese participants from the total number of Asian participants.

Total number of Asians = 240
Number of Japanese = 80
Number of Chinese = Total number of Asians - Number of Japanese
= 240 - 80
= 160

Since we are given that the number of Chinese boys is 60, we can calculate the number of Chinese girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of Chinese girls = Total number of Chinese - Number of Chinese boys
= 160 - 60
= 100

Therefore, the number of Chinese girls is 100."
"To determine Zaid's remaining monthly income after all expenses and donations, we can break down his expenditures and calculate the total deductions from his monthly income.

First, we calculate the total amount spent on rent and car fuel: 1/4 * 6000 = $1500 (rent) + 1/3 * 6000 = $2000 (car fuel) = $3500.

Next, we find the remaining amount after these deductions: 6000 - 3500 = $2500.

Then, we calculate the amount donated to charity: 1/2 * 2500 = $1250.

The amount left after the donation is 2500 - 1250 = $1250.

Finally, we subtract the amount given to his daughter and wife: 1250 - 200 - 700 = $350.

Therefore, Zaid will have $350 left after all these expenses and donations.

The final answer is: $350"
"To determine the total number of crabs the three individuals have, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as B, Monic has as M, and Rani has as R.

Given that Bo has 40 crabs, we can express this as B = 40.

We are also given that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, which can be represented as M = B - 4.

Furthermore, Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so R = M + 10.

Substituting the expression for M into the equation for R, we get R = (B - 4) + 10.

Now, we can substitute the value of B into the equation for R: R = (40 - 4) + 10 = 46.

To find the total number of crabs, we add the number of crabs each person has: Total = B + M + R = 40 + (40 - 4) + 46.

Simplifying the expression, we get Total = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122.

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122."

Lloyd's hourly wage is $10, and he worked a total of 5 hours in the first week and 8 hours in the second week. 

The total number of hours worked is 5 + 8 = 13 hours.

To find the total earnings, we multiply the total hours worked by the hourly wage: 13 hours * $10/hour = $130.

Therefore, Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks is $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we can utilize the concept of complementary probabilities. Since the winner garnered 3/4 of the total votes, the remaining fraction of votes represents the proportion of votes the loser received.

Total votes = 80
Winner's votes = (3/4) * 80 = 60

To find the loser's votes, we can subtract the winner's votes from the total votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
= 80 - 60
= 20

Therefore, the loser received 20 votes."
"To determine the number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the quantities of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as x. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses can be expressed as 4x. Additionally, we know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, which can be represented as 5x.

We are given that the number of pink calla lilies is 200. Setting up the equation 5x = 200 allows us to solve for x:

5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we have found the value of x, we can calculate the number of red roses by multiplying 4 and x:

Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach using algebraic equations.

Let's denote Jan's current age as J, Mark's current age as M, and Jean's current age as E.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. E = M + 2 (since Jean is two years older than Mark)
2. M - 2 = (J / 2) + 5 (since two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age)

We are also given that Jan is 30 years old, so J = 30.

Substituting J = 30 into equation (2), we get:

M - 2 = (30 / 2) + 5
M - 2 = 15 + 5
M - 2 = 20
M = 22

Now that we have found Mark's current age, we can find Jean's age using equation (1):

E = M + 2
E = 22 + 2
E = 24

Therefore, Jean's current age is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the time difference between the two teams, we can calculate the total time for each team.

The well-rounded team's time is 55 seconds per runner, and they have four runners. Therefore, their total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's time can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: 

Time = (n/2) * (a1 + an)

where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, n = 4, a1 = 60, and an = 51. 

Time = (4/2) * (60 + 51) 
Time = 2 * 111 
Time = 222 seconds

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"When analyzing the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 versus rolling two even numbers in a row, we can approach this problem from a combinatorial perspective.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is equivalent to the ratio of favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) to the total number of possible outcomes (6). This can be expressed as:

P(number > 3) = 3/6 = 1/2

To calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we consider the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll (1/2) and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll (also 1/2), given that the first roll was even. This results in:

P(2 even numbers in a row) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4

Now, we can find the difference in probability by subtracting the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:

P(number > 3) - P(2 even numbers in a row) = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(1/4) * 100% = 25%

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

Final answer: $\boxed{25\%}$"
"To determine the total number of apples picked, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, we can express this relationship as a ratio. Let's denote the number of apples picked by Jenna's mom as 'm' and the number of apples picked by Jenna as 'j'. The given information states that m = 20.

We can set up a proportion to represent the relationship between the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mom:

j = (1/2)m

Substituting the value of m, we get:

j = (1/2)(20)
j = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked, we add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mom:

Total apples = j + m
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

Therefore, the total number of apples picked is 30."
"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we can start by calculating the total number of straw pieces used for the rats. We know that the total straw used for rats is 160, and we also know that each hamster and rabbit receives a specific amount of straw.

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'x'. Since there are 3 cages, the total number of rats is 3x. Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw used for rats is 6 * 3x = 18x.

We also know that 10 hamsters receive 5 pieces of straw each, resulting in a total of 10 * 5 = 50 straw pieces. Additionally, 20 pieces of straw are used for the rabbits.

The total straw used for all animals is the sum of the straw used for rats, hamsters, and rabbits. We can set up the equation:

18x + 50 + 20 = 160

Combine like terms:

18x + 70 = 160

Subtract 70 from both sides:

18x = 90

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 5

Since x represents the number of rats in each cage, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the interest, we can utilize the formula for simple interest: I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the monthly interest rate, and t is the time period in months.

Given that Mandy owes Benedict $100 with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can calculate the interest for 3 months as follows:

I = P * r * t
I = $100 * 0.02 * 3
I = $6

Now, we add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict:

Amount to be paid = P + I
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6
Amount to be paid = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To determine the number of bags of wheat sold, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of bags as x.

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold: 30x.

The total cost is the cost of buying the bags plus the cost of transportation: 20x + 2x = 22x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost: 400 = 30x - 22x.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 400 = 8x.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8: x = 400 / 8.

x = 50.

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total cost of the expenses, we can break down the problem into its components. 

First, we calculate the cost of the food by subtracting $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides by multiplying the cost per ride by the number of rides. 

Cost per ride = $33
Number of rides = 2
Total cost of rides = 2 * $33
Total cost of rides = $66

Now, we can find the total cost of all expenses by adding the cost of tickets, food, and rides. 

Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3. 

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To calculate the total number of peaches John collects, we can utilize the concept of unit conversion and multiplication. 

First, we convert the time from hours to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Next, we multiply the number of minutes by the rate of peach collection per minute: 180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the daily insect requirement for the flock of ducks, we can utilize the concept of unit conversion and division.

First, we need to convert the weekly requirement from pounds to a more manageable unit, such as grams. Since 1 pound is equivalent to 453.592 grams, we can make the conversion as follows:

3.5 pounds/week × (453.592 grams/pound) = 1587.948 grams/week

Now, we can divide the weekly requirement by 7 to obtain the daily requirement:

1587.948 grams/week ÷ 7 days/week = 226.94 grams/day

To express this in pounds, we can divide by 453.592:

226.94 grams/day ÷ 453.592 grams/pound ≈ 0.5 pounds/day

Therefore, the ducks require approximately 0.5 pounds of insects per day.

Final answer: $\boxed{0.5}$"
"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we can break down the problem into several steps.

First, we calculate the net change in the number of trees per year. Tom plants 10 trees per year and chops down 2 trees per year, resulting in a net gain of 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Since Tom starts with 50 trees, we can calculate the total number of trees he has after 10 years by adding the net gain to the initial number of trees:

50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 trees

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find 30% of 130 trees, we multiply 130 by 0.3:

130 * 0.3 = 39 trees

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees Tom has:

130 - 39 = 91 trees

Therefore, Tom has 91 trees left after 10 years.

The final answer is: 91"
"To determine the difference between the number of pink plastic flamingos and white plastic flamingos, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote the initial number of pink plastic flamingos as P. On Saturday, the neighbors took one third of the flamingos back, which is P/3. The remaining number of pink plastic flamingos is P - P/3 = 2P/3. Then, 18 more pink plastic flamingos were added to the collection, making the total number of pink plastic flamingos 2P/3 + 18.

The number of white plastic flamingos is given as 6.

The difference between the number of pink plastic flamingos and white plastic flamingos is (2P/3 + 18) - 6.

Since we know that the initial number of pink plastic flamingos is 18, we can substitute P = 18 into the expression: (2(18)/3 + 18) - 6.

Simplifying the expression, we get (36/3 + 18) - 6 = 12 + 18 - 6 = 24.

Therefore, the difference between the number of pink plastic flamingos and white plastic flamingos is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the change Violetta will receive, we must first calculate the total cost of the crayons. Since each crayon costs $2 and she needs 5, the total cost can be found by multiplying the cost per crayon by the number of crayons:

Total Cost = Number of Crayons * Cost per Crayon
Total Cost = 5 * $2
Total Cost = $10

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount Violetta has:

Change = Amount Violetta Has - Total Cost
Change = $20 - $10
Change = $10

Therefore, Violetta will receive $10 in change."
"To determine the cost of 8 pens, we must first establish the cost of a single pen. Given that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, and the individual costs are $1.20 and $0.30, respectively, we can calculate the cost of a pen as follows:

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
= $1.20 + $0.30
= $1.50

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of a single pen by 8:

Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50
= $12.00

Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is $12.00."
"To determine the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. Since each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, we can calculate the total amount of carrots distributed by multiplying the number of restaurants by the amount each receives.

Total amount of carrots distributed = Number of restaurants * Amount per restaurant
= 40 * 2
= 80 pounds

Now, we can find the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used by subtracting the total amount distributed from the total amount available.

Number of pounds of carrots that will not be used = Total amount of carrots available - Total amount of carrots distributed
= 200 - 80
= 120 pounds

Therefore, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used."
"To determine the number of children in Soda, we can utilize the principle of set theory, specifically the concept of complementary counting. This involves subtracting the sum of the number of men and women from the total population to obtain the number of children.

Let's apply this principle:

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Using the formula for complementary counting:

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)
= 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
= 23786 - 17509
= 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To determine the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has, we can break down the problem into three separate calculations.

First, we calculate the number of cards collected in the first month, which is 3 times the initial number of cards: 3 * 20 = 60.

Next, we calculate the number of cards collected in the second month, which is 20 fewer than the first month: 60 - 20 = 40.

Then, we calculate the number of cards collected in the third month, which is twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200.

Now, we add up the cards from each month: 20 (initial cards) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320.

Therefore, Elaine now has a total of 320 Pokémon cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{320}$"
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we can break down the problem into two parts. First, we need to find the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

Let's denote the number of sentences for each publisher as x. We know that x + x = 1000, since Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences. Solving for x, we get:

2x = 1000
x = 1000 / 2
x = 500

Now that we know Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher, we can calculate his earnings from each publisher. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, his earnings from Publisher A are:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, his earnings from Publisher B are:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

To find Mark's total weekly earnings, we can add his earnings from both publishers:

Total earnings = Earnings from Publisher A + Earnings from Publisher B
= 2500 cents + 5000 cents
= 7500 cents

The final answer is: $\boxed{7500}$"
"To determine the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the morning and afternoon water intake separately. 

Morning water intake: 5 pails * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters
Afternoon water intake: 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters

Next, we add the morning and afternoon water intakes to find the total daily water intake.

Total water per day = 25 liters + 30 liters = 55 liters

Therefore, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day."
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the 5% raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the monetary reward: $5,000.

Next, we need to calculate the 5% raise on his weekly salary. To do this, we'll multiply his weekly salary by 0.05 (which represents 5% as a decimal):
$2000 * 0.05 = $100

Now, we'll add the raise to his weekly salary:
$2000 + $100 = $2100

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we'll multiply his new weekly salary by 52 to get his total earnings for the year:
$2100 * 52 = $109,200

Finally, we'll add the monetary reward to his total earnings:
$109,200 + $5,000 = $114,200

The final answer is: $114,200"
"To calculate the total number of barrels of wine produced, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we multiply the number of acres by the tons of grapes produced per acre, and then multiply that result by the number of barrels produced per ton.

Let's denote the number of acres as A, tons of grapes per acre as T, and barrels of wine per ton as B. The formula to calculate the total barrels of wine produced is:

Total Barrels = A * T * B

Given A = 10 acres and T = 5 tons/acre, B = 2 barrels/ton, we can substitute these values into the formula:

Total Barrels = 10 * 5 * 2
Total Barrels = 100

Therefore, the farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we can break down his cheese consumption into three categories: lunch, breakfast, and dinner.

Carl's lunch consumption can be calculated as 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices.

For breakfast, Carl used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. With 3 omelets consumed over 3 days, his breakfast cheese consumption is 3 omelets/day * 3 days * 3 slices/omelet = 27 slices.

Carl's dinner consumption is given as 8 slices.

Now, we can calculate the total number of slices of cheese Carl used by adding the slices from each meal: 14 (lunch) + 27 (breakfast) + 8 (dinner) = 49 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{49}$"
"To determine the total number of pens Janet has now, we can employ the principle of addition. We start by calculating the number of pens in each color category and then summing them together.

First, we calculate the number of blue pens: 6 bags * 9 pens per bag = 54 blue pens.

Next, we calculate the number of red pens: 2 bags * 6 pens per bag = 12 red pens.

Now, we add the number of pens of each color: 22 green pens + 10 yellow pens + 54 blue pens + 12 red pens = 98 pens.

Therefore, Janet now has a total of 98 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the required score on the sixth test, we can utilize the concept of weighted averages. Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we'll first find the total score of the first five tests and then calculate the desired total score for six tests.

Let's denote the sum of the first five test scores as S5 and the desired average as A. We know that S5 = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438. The desired average is 93, so A = 93.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we'll assume the lowest score is 71. The new sum of the remaining four scores is S4 = S5 - 71 = 438 - 71 = 367.

To find the desired total score for six tests, we multiply the desired average by 6: 
A × 6 = 93 × 6 = 558.

Now, we can find the required score on the sixth test by subtracting S4 from the desired total score: 
Required score = 558 - 367 = 191.

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 191 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

The final answer is 191."
"To calculate the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we can break down the problem into two distinct periods.

First, let's calculate the total kilometers for the initial period. Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks. This can be represented as 5 * 4 = 20 times. Since he rode 25 kilometers each time, the total kilometers for this period is 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

Next, we'll calculate the total kilometers for the second period. Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks. This can be represented as 2 * 3 = 6 times. Since he rode 60 kilometers each time, the total kilometers for this period is 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

To find the overall total, we add the kilometers from both periods: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{860}$"
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we must consider the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately. 

First, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is given by the product of the number of chocolate bars and their individual weight:

25 * 40g = 1000g

Next, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. Since each candied apple weighs 20g (as each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple) and there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:

80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:

1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the number of cakes she purchased each day and summing them up.

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought 3 times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which can be expressed as 3 × 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which can be calculated as 5 × 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes.

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To calculate the cost of each cup, we can start by determining the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

Next, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

Now, we can find the cost of each cup by dividing the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. There are 20 * 12 = 240 cups in 20 dozen.

Cost per cup = $16800 / 240 cups = $70.

Therefore, the cost of each cup is $70."
"To determine the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we can set up an equation based on her earnings from babysitting and lawn mowing.

Let x be the number of times Sara mows the lawn. Her total earnings from babysitting can be represented as 5x (since she earns $5 per session), and her total earnings from lawn mowing can be represented as 4x (since she earns $4 per session). We know that she needs to earn a total of $40 more to afford the jacket and shoes.

The equation to represent this situation is:

5x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

9x = 40

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 40/9

x = 4.44

Since Sara cannot mow the lawn a fraction of a time, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure she earns enough to cover the cost. Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn at least 5 times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's represent the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is 42, with red chickens producing 3 eggs a day and white chickens producing 5 eggs a day. This can be represented by the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the time Gary spends walking, we can utilize the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width. Given that the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now, we can divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:

Time = P / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the edge of the park."
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. We know that the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, so it can be represented as x + 50. The total number of customers on the first two days is the sum of the customers on each day, which is x + (x + 50). We are given that the total number of customers on the third day is 500. Since the third day's customer count is the sum of the first two days, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 50) + y = 500

However, we are not given the value of y, which represents the number of customers on the third day. We can simplify the equation by combining like terms:

2x + 50 + y = 500

Subtracting 50 from both sides:

2x + y = 450

We are also given that the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, so we can express y as x + 50. Substituting this into the equation:

2x + (x + 50) = 450

Combine like terms:

3x + 50 = 450

Subtract 50 from both sides:

3x = 400

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 133.33

Since x represents the number of customers on the first day, we can find the number of customers on the second day by adding 50:

x + 50 = 133.33 + 50 = 183.33

Now, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day:

500 - (x + (x + 50)) = 500 - (133.33 + 183.33) = 500 - 316.66 = 183.34

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get:

The number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is approximately 183.

The final answer is: $\boxed{183}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons and the initial amount of water in the big pool as 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in both pools has decreased by 4 gallons/minute for the past 4 minutes. Therefore, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We also know that the small pool has lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has x - 16 gallons of water. We are given that the small pool has y gallons of water now, so we can set up the equation:

x - 16 = y

We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Rearranging the second equation, we get y = x - 16.

Substituting y = x - 16 into the first equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides, we get:

2x + 48 = 4x

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 24

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation y = x - 16:

y = 24 - 16
y = 8

The small pool now has 8 gallons of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and belt, we can use the following calculation:

Total cost of items = $320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00

Now, divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

Total hours = Total cost ÷ Hourly wage
= $352.00 ÷ $8.00
= 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

Final answer: 44"
"To calculate Janeth's remaining balance, we need to determine the total amount she needs to pay and subtract it from the initial amount borrowed.

The additional amount Janeth borrowed is 10% of the initial $2000. This can be calculated as:

Additional amount = 0.10 * $2000 = $200

The total amount Janeth needs to pay is the sum of the initial amount and the additional amount:

Total amount = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Since Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate the total amount she will pay as:

Total amount paid = $165 * 12 = $1980

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount Janeth needs to pay to find the remaining balance:

Remaining balance = Total amount - Total amount paid
= $2200 - $1980
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

Given that there are 4 roses and 7 more dahlias than roses, we can express the number of dahlias as 4 + 7 = 11. 

Now, we can calculate the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15.

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To calculate the average age of the three individuals in three years, we can utilize the concept of linear progression. Given that Harriet's current age is 21 years, we can determine the ages of the other two individuals.

Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can express Zack's age as 2 * Harriet's age, which is 2 * 21 = 42 years. Similarly, Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so it can be represented as 3 * Harriet's age, which is 3 * 21 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age, we can sum up their ages and divide by 3:

Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3

Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, we can simplify the expression:

Average age = (21 + 3 + 21 + 3 + 42 + 3 + 63 + 3) / 3
= (21 + 42 + 63) + 3 * 3
= 126 + 9
= 135 / 3
= 45

Therefore, the average age of the three individuals in three years will be 45 years."
"To determine the number of points Jojo scored, we can utilize the given information to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of points Jojo scored as 'J'. We know that the total points scored by all four students is 251.

The points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna can be represented as 68, 44, and 85, respectively. We can express Yuri's points as 0.5 * 68 + 10, and Brianna's points as 68 + 17.

We can now set up the equation:

68 + 44 + 85 + J = 251

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

197 + J = 251

Subtract 197 from both sides of the equation to isolate J:

J = 251 - 197

J = 54

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points."
"To calculate the total time spent on crossword puzzles, we can multiply the number of puzzles by the time spent on each puzzle. In this case, Carmen solved 3 crossword puzzles, each taking 10 minutes to complete. Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is 3 * 10 = 30 minutes.

Similarly, to calculate the total time spent on sudoku puzzles, we multiply the number of puzzles by the time spent on each puzzle. Carmen solved 8 sudoku puzzles, each taking 5 minutes to complete. Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is 8 * 5 = 40 minutes.

To find the total time spent on both activities, we add the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles: 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the current amount of water in the tank, we must consider the sequence of events. Initially, the tank contains 120 liters of water. Celine then uses 90 liters for her garden, leaving 120 - 90 = 30 liters.

Next, she collects rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. This can be calculated as 2 * 30 = 60 liters.

The total amount of water in the tank after these events is the sum of the remaining water and the collected rainwater: 30 + 60 = 90 liters.

Therefore, the current amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

Final answer: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the total number of flowers Andy plants, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate the number of petunias by subtracting 40 from the number of geraniums. 

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
= 90 - 40
= 50

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias.

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
= 90 + 50
= 140

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"To calculate the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we can use the formula for the sum of two amounts. 

Let's denote the amount spent in the first year as A and the amount spent in the second year as B. We know that A = $15,000 and B = A/3. 

The total amount spent on advertising for the two years is A + B. 

Substituting the values, we get: 
Total = $15,000 + ($15,000 / 3) 
Total = $15,000 + $5,000 
Total = $20,000 

Therefore, the total amount spent on advertising for the two years is $20,000."
"To calculate the total cost of the rentals, we can apply the concept of linear multiplication. 

Carlos' cost can be calculated as 3 hours * $30/hour, which equals $90. Similarly, Benji's cost can be calculated as 5 hours * $18/hour, resulting in $90.

The total cost is the sum of their individual costs, which is $90 + $90 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To determine the total number of days for the round trip, we must consider the time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and the time it takes to return from Rochester to New Jersey by car.

The bus trip from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days. Since the return trip is by car, which takes half as many days as the bus trip, the car trip from Rochester to New Jersey will take 6 / 2 = 3 days.

To find the total number of days for the round trip, we add the days for each leg: 6 (bus trip) + 3 (car trip) = 9 days.

Therefore, the total number of days for the round trip is 9 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we must first calculate the total number of cards James has after the transactions.

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards, totaling 90 cards. He then loses 8 water type cards, reducing the total to 90 - 8 = 82 cards. Subsequently, he acquires 14 grass type cards, increasing the total to 82 + 14 = 96 cards.

The number of water type cards remains unchanged at 32. To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100.

Probability = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100
Probability = (32 / 96) * 100
Probability = 0.3333 * 100
Probability ≈ 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water type card is 33%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{33}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's meal, we can break down the costs as follows:

The base burrito costs $6.50. Adding the extra meat for $2.00, the total becomes $6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50. Then, adding the extra cheese for $1.00, the total is $8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50. Next, adding the avocado for $1.00, the total is $9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50. Finally, adding the 2 sauces for $0.50 each, the total is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00. 

The upgrade for $3.00 adds to the total, making it $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00. However, Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total, resulting in $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."
"To determine the time it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we can calculate their combined rate of piece placement and then divide the total number of pieces by this rate.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute, and her mom's rate is half of that, which is 2 pieces per minute. Therefore, their combined rate is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the time required to complete the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

Time = Total Pieces / Combined Rate
Time = 360 / 6
Time = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours by dividing by 60:

Time (in hours) = 60 minutes / 60
Time (in hours) = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we must first calculate the initial number of watermelons ready for harvest. Given that 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of watermelons ready for harvest = 0.3 * 120
= 36

Next, we need to find the number of watermelons remaining on the farm after Ashlyn took 36 home. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of watermelons taken from the total:

Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36
= 84

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest. To find the number of watermelons ready for harvest, we can calculate 3/4 of 84:

Number of watermelons ready for harvest = (3/4) * 84
= 63

Finally, to find the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total remaining watermelons:

Number of watermelons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63
= 21

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the fleet of cars, we can break down the expenses into three components: the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

First, let's calculate the cost of the cars. Mark buys 12 cars at $20,000 each, so the total cost of the cars is:

12 * $20,000 = $240,000

Next, we need to calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%, so we can calculate the tax as:

0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000

Finally, we need to calculate the registration fees for the 12 cars. The registration fee is $1,000 per car, so the total registration fee is:

12 * $1,000 = $12,000

Now, we can add up the costs to find the total amount Mark pays:

$240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To determine the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Given that Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert on Monday, and Robert collects 20 shells, we can express this as an equation:

Let's denote the number of shells Robert collects as R and the number of shells Kylie collects as K. We have:

R = 20
K = R + 5
K = 20 + 5
K = 25

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. This can be represented as:

K_Tuesday = 2 * K
K_Tuesday = 2 * 25
K_Tuesday = 50

Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the total number of insects in the garden, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic addition. Given that the number of bugs is half the number of ants, we can express this relationship as a ratio.

Let's denote the number of ants as A and the number of bugs as B. We are provided with the value of A, which is 50. The ratio of bugs to ants is 1:2, so we can express the number of bugs as B = A/2.

B = 50/2
B = 25

Now, we can calculate the total number of insects by adding the number of ants and bugs.

Total number of insects = A + B
= 50 + 25
= 75

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To determine the number of penguins still sunbathing, we must first calculate the total number of penguins that left their sunbathing spot. One-third of the 36 penguins jumped into the ocean, which is equivalent to 36 / 3 = 12 penguins. Similarly, another one-third of the penguins went inside the cave to eat their dinner, also 12 penguins. 

The total number of penguins that left their sunbathing spot is the sum of these two groups: 12 + 12 = 24 penguins.

To find the number of penguins still sunbathing, we subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12 penguins.

Therefore, the number of penguins still sunbathing is 12.

Final Answer: The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of vines required to meet Steve's tomato needs, we must consider the total weekly consumption of tomatoes by both Steve and his girlfriend. 

Let's denote Steve's daily consumption as S and his girlfriend's daily consumption as G. We are given that S = 2G. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, we can express this as 6 = 2G, which yields G = 3. Therefore, the total weekly consumption is S + G = 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes per week.

Given that each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can calculate the number of vines required by dividing the total weekly consumption by 3.

Number of vines = Total weekly consumption / 3
= 9 / 3
= 3

Therefore, Steve needs 3 vines to produce enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend.

Final answer: 3"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we can use the concept of division to find the quotient when dividing the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza.

Let's denote the total number of slices needed as 'T' and the number of slices per pizza as 's'. We know that T = 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices, and s = 8 slices per pizza.

To find the number of pizzas, we can divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:

Number of pizzas = T / s
= 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza
= 10 pizzas

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends gets 4 slices."
"To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we can utilize the concept of ratios and proportions. Since Ram can create one full pen from the ink of five empty pens, we can establish a ratio of 5 empty pens to 1 full pen.

Now, let's calculate the total number of new pens Ram can create from the ink of the 25 pens. We can set up a proportion to find the number of full pens he can make:

5 empty pens / 1 full pen = 25 pens / x full pens

Cross-multiplying, we get:

5x = 25
x = 25 / 5
x = 5

This indicates that Ram can create 5 full pens from the ink of the 25 pens.

To find the total number of pens Ram will have, we add the original 25 pens to the 5 new pens:

25 (original pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens

Therefore, Ram will have a total of 30 pens."
"To calculate the final amount of money Johnny had after a year, we can follow a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to determine the initial amount of money Johnny had. He started with $20 and added an extra $10, so the total amount is $20 + $10 = $30.

Next, we know that the money tripled in a year. To find the final amount, we multiply the initial amount by 3: $30 * 3 = $90.

Therefore, the final amount of money Johnny had after a year is $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the sum of the ages of the three girls, we can utilize the given information to establish a linear relationship between their ages.

Let's denote Jessa's age as J, Joan's age as O, and Mary's age as M. We are provided with the following information:

1. J = 20
2. O = J + 5
3. M = O - 2

We can substitute the value of J into the equation for O to find Joan's age:
O = 20 + 5
O = 25

Next, we can substitute the value of O into the equation for M to find Mary's age:
M = 25 - 2
M = 23

Now, we can calculate the sum of their ages:
Sum = J + O + M
Sum = 20 + 25 + 23
Sum = 68

Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"To calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the number of students who went out through exit A. This can be calculated as 30% of the total number of students, which is 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.

Next, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit A from the total number of students to find the remaining students: 1000 - 300 = 700 students.

Then, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B, which is 3/5 of the remaining students: (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

Finally, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students to find the number of students who went out through exit C: 700 - 420 = 280 students.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as 'r'. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can express John's candies as 2r.

We are given that John has 54 candies, so we can set up the equation:

2r = 54

To find the value of 'r', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

r = 54 ÷ 2
r = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find James' candies by adding 6 to Robert's total:

James' candies = r + 6
= 27 + 6
= 33

To determine how many more candies John has than James, we can subtract James' total from John's total:

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
= 54 - 33
= 21

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James."
"To determine the total number of books Dolly and Pandora will collectively read, we can apply the principle of addition. 

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book, so she will read a total of 2 + 2 = 4 books.

Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book, so she will read a total of 1 + 1 = 2 books.

The total number of books they will collectively read is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

Therefore, the total number of books Dolly and Pandora will collectively read is 6."
"To determine the total time Mike spends writing per week, we can break down the problem into manageable components.

First, we need to calculate the total number of pages written per week. Since Mike receives and sends 3 letters per week, and each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages written per week is 3 * 5 = 15 pages.

Since Mike writes a page every 6 minutes, we can calculate the total time spent writing per week by multiplying the total number of pages written by the time it takes to write one page: 15 pages * 6 minutes/page = 90 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 1.5 hours writing per week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.5}$"
"To determine the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan, we must first calculate the total minutes used for his daily call with his boss. Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for this call can be calculated as follows:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. Therefore, the total minutes used is the sum of these two:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan:

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach to determine the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Let's denote the number of fries Griffin had initially as G, the number of fries Kyle took as K, the number of fries Billy took as B, the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as x, and the number of fries Colby took as C.

We are given the following information:

1. G = 24
2. K = 5
3. B = 2K = 2(5) = 10
4. C = K - 3 = 5 - 3 = 2
5. The final number of fries Griffin had is G - K - B + x = 27

Substituting the known values, we get:

24 - 5 - 10 + x = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

9 + x = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:

x = 18

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 18 fries.

Final answer: 18"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Therefore, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

Final answer: $\boxed{14}$"
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we can break down the problem into manageable components. 

First, we need to find the total hours worked by the makeup artist. Since she works 6 hours a day for 4 days a week, the total hours worked per week is 6 * 4 = 24 hours. Given that the movie takes 5 weeks to finish, the total hours worked is 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

Next, we calculate the total cost without the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost is 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

To apply the 10% discount, we calculate 10% of the total cost: 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000. 

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the amount Jean paid: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To determine the cost per person, we must first calculate the total cost of all the party supplies. This can be achieved by summing the individual costs of the items purchased.

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. To find the cost per person, we can divide the total cost by the number of people.

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

Therefore, each person paid $32."
"To calculate the total cost of the onions, we can use the formula:

Total Cost = Number of Bags × Weight per Bag × Cost per Pound

Given:
Number of Bags = 4
Weight per Bag = 50 pounds
Cost per Pound = $1.50

Total Cost = 4 × 50 × $1.50
Total Cost = 4 × 50 × 1.50
Total Cost = 4 × 75
Total Cost = $300

Therefore, the total cost of the onions is $300."
"To determine the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister, we can calculate the total calories from each individual's cookie consumption.

Sue's total cookies on Monday and Tuesday are 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue's total calories consumed is 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.

Her sister's total cookies on Monday and Tuesday are 5 + 13 = 18 cookies. Her total calories consumed is 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5600}$"
"To determine the number of boys in the third class, we can utilize the concept of proportions. Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, we can calculate the total number of students as follows:

Total students = 3 classes * 20 students/class = 60 students

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of girls is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30 girls.

We are given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls:

Girls in third class = Total girls - (Girls in first class + Girls in second class)
= 30 - (15 + 12)
= 30 - 27
= 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys is also 50% of the total number of students:

Boys in the school = 0.5 * 60
= 30 boys

To find the number of boys in the third class, we can set up a proportion:

Boys in third class / Total students = Boys in the school / Total students
Boys in third class / 60 = 30 / 60
Boys in third class = (30 / 60) * 60
Boys in third class = 30

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the current number of apps on Travis' tablet, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. 

We start with the initial number of apps, which is 61. Then, we subtract the number of apps deleted, which is 9, and finally, we add the number of apps downloaded, which is 18.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Initial number of apps - Number of apps deleted + Number of apps downloaded
= 61 - 9 + 18
= 70

Therefore, the current number of apps on Travis' tablet is 70."
"To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we can break down the information into two parts: wolves and cougars.

Let's denote the number of wolves killed last night as W and the number of cougars killed last night as C. We are given that W = 10 and C = 15.

We are also given that Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so the number of wolves killed today is 3C = 3(15) = 45.

Additionally, we know that the number of cougars killed today is three fewer than the number killed last night, so the number of cougars killed today is C - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals killed by adding the number of wolves and cougars killed last night and today:

Total number of wolves killed = W + 45 = 10 + 45 = 55
Total number of cougars killed = C + 12 = 15 + 12 = 27

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is 55 + 27 = 82.

The final answer is: $\boxed{82}$"
"To determine the floor Bill is on now, we can apply a simple algebraic expression. Let's represent Bill's starting floor as 'x'. The problem states that he rides the elevator up to the floor that's equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6. This can be expressed as 4x + 6.

Since Bill starts on the 3rd floor, we can substitute x = 3 into the expression:

4x + 6 = 4(3) + 6
= 12 + 6
= 18

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To determine the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we can use the concept of percentages and ratios. 

First, we need to calculate 30% of 30, which represents the reduction in the number of times Anne went down the slide compared to Mitchel. This can be calculated as 0.3 * 30 = 9.

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we subtract 9 from 30 to find the number of times Anne went down the slide: 30 - 9 = 21.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. To find the number of times Robert went down the slide, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4: 4 * 21 = 84.

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we must first calculate the total number of cows after Mr. Sylas' purchase. The initial number of cows in 20 stalls is 20 cows/stall * 20 stalls = 400 cows. Adding the 40 cows purchased, we get 400 cows + 40 cows = 440 cows.

Since the cows are divided equally among the 20 stalls, we can find the number of cows in each stall by dividing the total number of cows by 20 stalls: 440 cows / 20 stalls = 22 cows/stall.

Now, to find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 22 cows/stall * 8 stalls = 176 cows.

Therefore, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is 176."
"To calculate the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we can utilize the concept of place value and the values associated with each denomination.

First, let's calculate the value of each type of coin and add it to the value of the dollar bills.

- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2
- 40 dollar bills = 40 x $1 = $40

Now, let's add the values together: $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45

Therefore, Brady has a total of $45 in his piggy bank."
"To calculate the total weight of the redwood, we can employ a straightforward approach. Given that each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can first determine the total number of sections in the 200-foot tree by dividing the total height by the length of each section:

Total weight = Number of sections × Weight per section
= (200 feet / 10 feet per section) × 400 pounds per section
= 20 sections × 400 pounds per section
= 8000 pounds

However, we must account for the 30% of the wood that was eaten by the termites. To do this, we can calculate the weight of the wood that was consumed:

Weight of wood eaten = 30% of 8000 pounds
= 0.30 × 8000 pounds
= 2400 pounds

Now, we can find the weight of the remaining wood by subtracting the weight of the wood eaten from the total weight:

Weight of remaining wood = Total weight - Weight of wood eaten
= 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds
= 5600 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds.

Final answer: 5600"
"To calculate the total amount Nancy owes, we can employ the principle of addition. The cost of the overdue books is $0.50 per book, and she has 8 books that are overdue. Therefore, the total cost of the overdue books can be calculated as:

8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00

Additionally, there is a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book over a week overdue. To find the total amount Nancy owes, we add this flat fee to the cost of the overdue books:

$4.00 (overdue books) + $2.00 (flat fee) = $6.00

The total amount Nancy owes is $6.00."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of apples and bananas each person has.

Let A be the number of apples Andrea has, and B be the number of bananas Jamal has. We are given the following information:

A = B + 8 (Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal)
B = A - 4 (Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples)

We are also given that Andrea has 52 apples, so A = 52. We can substitute this value into the first equation to find B:

52 = B + 8
B = 52 - 8
B = 44

Now that we know Jamal has 44 apples, we can find the number of bananas he has:

B = A - 4
B = 44 - 4
B = 40

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find the number of bananas she has by dividing 40 by 2:

B = 40 / 2
B = 20

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have:

Total = A + B
Total = 52 + 44 + 20
Total = 116

The final answer is: $\boxed{116}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she is making. 

Total number of cookies = 36 (today) + 30 (tomorrow) = 66 cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are required for a dozen cookies, we can set up a proportion to find the total amount of flour needed:

Let x be the total amount of flour in cups. We know that 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies. So, we can set up the following proportion:

2 cups / 12 cookies = x cups / 66 cookies

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2 * 66 = 12x
132 = 12x

Now, we can divide both sides by 12:

x = 132 / 12
x = 11

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To determine the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can use the following calculation:

Let's denote the total number of pennies as P. We are given that P = 9,300. Two thirds of the pennies can be represented as (2/3)P.

The value of two thirds of the pennies is then (2/3)P = (2/3)(9,300) = 6,200 pennies.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount is 6,200 * $0.01 = $62.

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62."
"To determine the total number of marbles Maddison has, we can employ the concept of multiplication and addition. 

First, we calculate the initial number of marbles by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box: 5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles.

Next, we add the marbles Maddison received from her friend: 250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles.

Therefore, Maddison now has 270 marbles.

"To determine the number of trees in each yard, we can apply basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the number of trees Chris has as C, the number of trees Ferdinand has as F, and the number of trees Harry has as H. We are given the following information:

1. C = 6
2. F = C / 2
3. H = 2F + 5

We can substitute the value of C into the equation for F:
F = 6 / 2
F = 3

Now, we can substitute the value of F into the equation for H:
H = 2(3) + 5
H = 6 + 5
H = 11

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard:
H - F = 11 - 3
H - F = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total amount of money the girls have, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we establish the individual amounts each girl has:

- Carmen has $100.
- Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
- Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, we can calculate the total amount by adding the individual amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To calculate the total price of the house, we need to consider the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which can be calculated as:

Brokerage fee = 0.05 × $350,000 = $17,500

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which can be calculated as:

Transfer fee = 0.12 × $350,000 = $42,000

The total additional fees are the sum of the brokerage fee and the transfer fee:

Total additional fees = $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

To find the total price of the house, we add the selling price and the total additional fees:

Total price of the house = $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference is:

Difference = $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house, we must consider the various costs associated with the transaction. The selling price of the house is $400,000. 

First, we calculate the transfer fees, which amount to 3% of the selling price. This can be expressed as 0.03 * $400,000. 

Transfer fees = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price. This can be expressed as 0.05 * $400,000.

Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

The total amount paid for transfer fees and brokerage is the sum of these two costs.

Total amount paid = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee
= $12,000 + $20,000
= $32,000

To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we subtract the total amount paid from the selling price.

Net proceeds = Selling price - Total amount paid
= $400,000 - $32,000
= $368,000

"To determine the total time required from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we must consider the time it takes to heat up the oil and the time it takes to cook the chicken.

First, we calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. The initial heating time is 20 minutes, and then it takes 40% longer to reach the desired temperature. This additional time can be calculated as 40% of 20 minutes, which is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat up the oil to 400 degrees is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken. It is given that this time is 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat up the oil. So, the cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

Finally, we add the heating time and the cooking time to find the total time required from starting the oil to having cooked chicken. The total time is 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{51}$"
"To calculate the total amount spent on all ads, we can utilize the principle of arithmetic addition. 

First, we'll calculate the total cost of newspaper ads by multiplying the cost per ad ($5) by the number of ads (50): 
$5 * 50 = $250

Next, we'll calculate the total cost of television ads by multiplying the cost per ad ($75) by the number of ads (15): 
$75 * 15 = $1125

Now, we'll add the total cost of newspaper ads and television ads to find the overall expenditure: 
$250 + $1125 = $1375

Therefore, the total amount spent on buying all the ads is $1375."
"To determine the number of blue golf balls, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

Given that the juggler can juggle 16 balls in total, and half of these balls are golf balls, we can calculate the number of golf balls as follows:

Number of golf balls = Total number of balls / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

Since half of the golf balls are blue, we can calculate the number of blue golf balls as follows:

Number of blue golf balls = Number of golf balls / 2
= 8 / 2
= 4

Therefore, there are 4 blue golf balls."
"To determine the total number of M&Ms Mary received, we can calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and sum them together.

Let's denote the number of M&Ms in the first bag as x. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so its M&Ms can be represented as x + 12. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so its M&Ms can be represented as x/2.

The total number of M&Ms is the sum of the M&Ms in each bag: x + (x + 12) + (x/2).

To simplify the expression, we can combine like terms: 
x + x + 12 + x/2 = 2x + 12 + x/2

To add the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 2. So we can rewrite x as 2x/2:
2x/2 + 12 + x/2 = 3x/2 + 12

Now, we can combine the terms:
3x/2 + 12 = (3x + 24)/2

Since we know the number of M&Ms in the first bag is 300, we can substitute x = 300 into the expression:
(3(300) + 24)/2 = (900 + 24)/2 = 924/2 = 462

Therefore, the total number of M&Ms Mary received is 462.

The final answer is 462."
"To determine the total number of windows, we can break down the problem into two components: the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows not connected to bedrooms.

First, we calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms. Since each bedroom has 2 windows and there are 3 bedrooms in each of the 2 houses, we can express this as:

2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows

Next, we calculate the total number of additional windows not connected to bedrooms. There are 4 additional windows in each house, and there are 2 houses, so we can express this as:

2 houses * 4 additional windows per house = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows:

12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows

Therefore, the total number of windows is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the change, we need to subtract the total cost of the items from the amount paid. 

The total cost is $14.99. The amount paid is $20. 

Change = Amount Paid - Total Cost
Change = $20 - $14.99
Change = $5.01

Therefore, the cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, we can start by calculating the total number of stitches for the collar and rosette. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 

The collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

To find the number of stitches for the two sleeves, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater:
1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:
630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 315."
"To calculate the total cost of the seeds, we can apply the principle of multiplication to find the cost of each type of seed and then add the results.

The cost of the tomato seeds can be calculated as 20 packets * $40/packet, which equals $800. Similarly, the cost of the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30/packet, resulting in $2400.

The total cost of the seeds is the sum of these two values: $800 + $2400 = $3200.

Therefore, the total cost of the seeds is $3200."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we can break down the information into components and calculate each part separately.

Let's denote the number of lines in the first scene as x. Since the first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, we can express this as an equation: x = 2 * 54. Solving for x, we get x = 108.

However, only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's, so we can calculate his lines from the first scene as 108 / 3 = 36.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so its total number of lines is 54 + 6 = 60. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, which can be calculated as 60 * 4/5 = 48.

Now, we add up the lines from the song and both scenes: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138.

Therefore, Sean has a total of 138 lines to memorize.

The final answer is: $\boxed{138}$"
"To determine the number of cards with the letter D, we can break down the problem into steps:

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 * 80 = 32.

Next, we subtract the cards with A from the total: 80 - 32 = 48.

Then, we calculate the number of cards with the letter B: 1/2 * 48 = 24.

Now, we subtract the cards with B from the remaining: 48 - 24 = 24.

We then find the number of cards with the letter C: 5/8 * 24 = 15.

Finally, we subtract the cards with C from the remaining: 24 - 15 = 9.

Therefore, the number of cards with the letter D is 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total time required to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we can calculate the time for each type of hole separately and then sum them.

The time to dig a small hole is 3 minutes, and the time to dig a large hole is 10 minutes. 

First, we'll calculate the total time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes.

Next, we'll calculate the total time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes.

Now, we'll add the time for small holes and large holes to get the total time: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we'll divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. Given that their current ages add up to 20, we can express this as an equation: x + y = 20, where x and y represent their current ages.

When we add 10 to each of their ages, we are essentially adding 10 to both sides of the equation, resulting in:

x + 10 + y + 10 = 20 + 10 + 10

This simplifies to:

x + y + 20 = 40

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"To solve this problem, we can employ algebraic techniques to represent the given information and derive the value of Sam's current age.

Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. The problem states that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which can be expressed as:

R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write the equation:

R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Substituting R = 6S into the equation, we get:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Now, let's simplify the equation by subtracting 3S from both sides:

3S + 9 = 27

Next, we subtract 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Finally, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for S:

S = 18/3

S = 6

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we can use the formula for the sum of two quantities: 

Cost = (Number of popsicles * Price per popsicle) + (Number of ice cream bars * Price per ice cream bar)
= (20 * $0.25) + (4 * $0.50)
= $5 + $2
= $7

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is $7."
"To determine the total number of spots, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the number of spots on a mamba as 'x'. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, the number of spots on a cobra can be represented as 2x.

We are given that there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

40(2x) + 60(x) = total spots

Combine like terms:

80x + 60x = total spots
140x = total spots

Now, we are asked to find half the total number of spots. To do this, we can divide the total number of spots by 2:

(140x) / 2 = 70x

We are also given that a cobra has 70 spots. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can set up the equation:

2x = 70

Solving for x, we get:

x = 70 / 2
x = 35

Now that we know the number of spots on a mamba, we can find the total number of spots:

Total spots = 140x
Total spots = 140(35)
Total spots = 4900

Half the total number of spots is:

(4900) / 2
= 2450

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To calculate the total cost of pizzas for Maddy's cousin's soccer game, we need to determine the total number of people attending the event. 

First, we calculate the number of guests: 12 team members * 2 guests per team member = 24 guests. Adding the 3 coaches, the total number of people is 12 (team members) + 3 (coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3 to find the number of pizzas needed: 39 people / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

The cost of each pizza is $15, so the total cost is 13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we can calculate the total space occupied by the topaz gemstones and then find the remaining space that needs to be filled with beads.

The total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 inches, and each necklace is 25 inches long. The space between the gemstones can be found by subtracting the length of the gemstones from the total length of the necklace:

25 inches (total length) - 8 inches (topaz gemstones) = 17 inches

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can divide the remaining space by the length of each bead to find the number of beads used:

17 inches ÷ (1/4 inch) = 17 × 4 = 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"To calculate the total number of stories written, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic sequences. Each child doubled their initial number of stories in the second week. 

Let's denote the initial number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot as A, B, and M, respectively. We are given that A = 20, B = 40, and M = 60.

In the second week, each child doubles their initial number of stories. Therefore, the number of stories written by each child in the second week can be represented as 2A, 2B, and 2M, respectively.

The total number of stories written in the first week is A + B + M = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120.

To find the total number of stories written in the second week, we multiply the initial number of stories by 2 for each child and add them together: 2A + 2B + 2M = 2(20) + 2(40) + 2(60) = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240.

The total number of stories written in both weeks is the sum of the stories written in the first and second weeks: 120 + 240 = 360.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the brother's age in 3 years, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. Given that the brother's current age is twice Ann's age, we can express this relationship as:

Brother's current age = 2 * Ann's current age
Brother's current age = 2 * 9
Brother's current age = 18

To find the brother's age in 3 years, we can add 3 to his current age:

Brother's age in 3 years = Brother's current age + 3
Brother's age in 3 years = 18 + 3
Brother's age in 3 years = 21

Therefore, the brother's age in 3 years will be 21."
"To determine the amount of money Kelly will have left after purchasing the can of pop, we can calculate the total value of her coins and subtract the cost of the pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is equivalent to 5 x 25 cents = 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, which is 2 x 10 cents = 20 cents. The total value of her coins is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find the amount of money Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total value of her coins:

145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we can employ a straightforward approach by first calculating the total number of stars and then subtracting the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

Let's denote the number of 5-star rows as 'x'. The total number of stars can be represented as:

8 * 3 + 6 * 2 + 5 * x = 76

Simplifying the equation, we get:

24 + 12 + 5x = 76

Combine like terms:

36 + 5x = 76

Subtract 36 from both sides:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we must consider the weight capacity of each truck and the total weight of the flagstones.

Given that each flagstone weighs 75 pounds and the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, we can calculate the number of trucks required as follows:

Let's denote the number of trucks needed as 'n'. The total weight of the flagstones (6000 pounds) divided by the weight capacity of each truck (2000 pounds) should be equal to 'n'. This can be represented by the equation:

n = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity of each truck
n = 6000 / 2000
n = 3

Therefore, 3 trucks are required to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

Final answer: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we can utilize the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Given that the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, we can determine the speed of the car in the slow lane as 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can apply the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour

Time = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the total number of medals given out for counting as x.

We are given that Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals. Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

We are also told that the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times more than the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. This can be expressed as the equation:

x = 10(22 + 17)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 10(39)

x = 390

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

The final answer is: $\boxed{390}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars each child will receive, we must first calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. 

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, with each packet containing 5 bars. Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Since each adult receives 6 chocolate bars, the total number of bars distributed to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16.

Now, we divide the remaining chocolate bars among the 8 children. This can be calculated as 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate Susan's earnings, we can break down the problem into manageable parts. First, we need to determine the total number of minutes she works. Since she works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

Total minutes = (11 hours - 8 hours) * 60 minutes/hour
Total minutes = 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour
Total minutes = 180 minutes

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works:

Effective working minutes = Total minutes - 30 minutes
Effective working minutes = 180 minutes - 30 minutes
Effective working minutes = 150 minutes

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can calculate her earnings as follows:

Earnings = (Effective working minutes / 10) * $5
Earnings = (150 minutes / 10) * $5
Earnings = 15 * $5
Earnings = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"To determine the total points of the three players after the fourth round, we need to calculate their points before and after the extra point distribution.

Initially, we have:
- Mike's points: 21
- Jim's points: 21 - 3 = 18
- Tony's points: 21 * 2 = 42

In the fourth round, each player receives an extra point if they have over 20 points. Therefore, we need to update the points of Mike and Tony.

- Mike's points: 21 + 1 = 22
- Jim's points: 18 (no change, as Jim's points are below 20)
- Tony's points: 42 + 1 = 43

Now, we add up the points of all three players to find the total points:
22 + 18 + 43 = 83

The final answer is: $\boxed{83}$"
"To determine the number of unwashed oranges, we must first calculate the total number of oranges washed by the sons. The oldest son, being 8 years old, washed 8 oranges, and the youngest son, being half as old as the oldest, washed 4 oranges.

The total number of oranges washed is the sum of the oranges washed by each son: 8 + 4 = 12.

Since Will initially bought 15 oranges, the number of unwashed oranges can be found by subtracting the total number of oranges washed from the initial amount: 15 - 12 = 3.

Therefore, the number of unwashed oranges is 3."
"To calculate the total count of activities Darren has done in the two days, we can break down the problem into individual components and apply basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the number of pushups, squats, and dumbbell presses on the first day as P1, S1, and D1, respectively. On the second day, the number of pushups, squats, and dumbbell presses are P2, S2, and D2, respectively.

Given:
P1 = 100
S1 = 50
D1 = 20

P2 = P1 + 20
S2 = S1 - 10
D2 = 2 * D1

Now, let's calculate the values for the second day:
P2 = 100 + 20 = 120
S2 = 50 - 10 = 40
D2 = 2 * 20 = 40

To find the total count of activities, we add the number of pushups, squats, and dumbbell presses for both days:
Total count = P1 + P2 + S1 + S2 + D1 + D2
= 100 + 120 + 50 + 40 + 20 + 40
= 350

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To determine the number of weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we can employ the concept of unit rates and division.

First, we establish the daily consumption rate of rice per person, which is 0.2 kg per meal, and since there are two meals per day, the total daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

With 5 members in the household, the total daily consumption is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7, yielding 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg per week.

Now, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to determine the number of weeks the rice will last:

42 kg ÷ 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

Therefore, the rice will last for 3 weeks.

Final answer: 3"
"To determine the number of crates Sam was short of his target, we must first calculate the total number of crates sold. We know that Sam sold 20 crates over the weekend, and the remaining crates were sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. 

Let's denote the number of crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday as T, W, and Th, respectively. We are given the following information:

T + W + Th = 45 (total crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday)
T + W + Th = 45

We also know that Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so we can add the crates sold over the weekend to the total crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday to find the total number of crates sold in the week.

Total crates sold = T + W + Th + 20
Total crates sold = 45 + 20
Total crates sold = 65

Now, we can find the difference between the total crates sold and the target by subtracting the total crates sold from the target.

Target = 120
Difference = Target - Total crates sold
Difference = 120 - 65
Difference = 55

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the desk, we can model the bidding process as an arithmetic sequence. The initial bid is $200, and each subsequent bid increases by $50. Since there are 4 bids in total (including Carmen's), we can calculate the final bid as follows:

Let's denote the first term (initial bid) as $a = $200, the common difference as d = $50, and the number of terms as n = 4. The final bid can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:

an = a + (n - 1)d

Substituting the values, we get:

an = $200 + (4 - 1)($50)
an = $200 + 3($50)
an = $200 + $150
an = $350

Since Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, her bid is the third term in the sequence. Therefore, her bid is $350.

The total cost of the desk is the sum of all bids, which is:

Total Cost = a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + (a + 3d)
= $200 + ($200 + $50) + ($200 + 2($50)) + ($200 + 3($50))
= $200 + $250 + $300 + $400
= $1150

"To calculate the total cost of driving for John, we need to consider both the mileage-based charge and the monthly bonus.

The total distance driven per year is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 52 weeks/year = 15,600 miles/year. 

The cost of driving is $2 per mile, so the total cost of driving is 15,600 miles/year * $2/mile = $31,200.

Additionally, John receives a $150 monthly bonus, which amounts to $1,800 per year.

The total cost of driving per year is $31,200 + $1,800 = $33,000.

"To determine the time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we must first calculate the combined time he exercised on Monday and Sunday.

Let's denote the time Peter exercised on Monday as M and the time he exercised on Sunday as S. We are given that M = 16 minutes and S = 23 minutes. The combined time is M + S = 16 + 23 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we can express this as 2(M + S). 

2(M + S) = 2(16 + 23) 
= 2(39) 
= 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we can employ a simple combinatorial approach. When folding the paper, we create two distinct sections: the left side and the right side. Each section has 16 pages.

The total number of pages can be represented as the sum of the pages on the left and right sides. Since each side has 16 pages, we can express this as:

Total pages = 16 (left side) + 16 (right side)

However, this counts each page twice, as each page is shared between the left and right sides. To account for this, we divide the total by 2:

Total pages / 2 = (16 + 16) / 2

Simplifying the expression, we get:

Total pages / 2 = 32 / 2

Total pages / 2 = 16

Since we need 2 pieces of paper for each side, we multiply the result by 2:

Total pieces of paper = 2 * 16

Total pieces of paper = 32

Therefore, to make a 32-page tabloid, we need 32 pieces of paper.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To determine the amount of money Annika has left, we can apply the principle of subtraction. Given that she initially had $50 and spent $25 on food and snacks, and an additional $10 on rides, we can calculate the remaining amount as follows:

Initial amount = $50
Amount spent on food and snacks = $25
Amount spent on rides = $10
Total amount spent = $25 + $10 = $35

To find the remaining amount, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

Remaining amount = Initial amount - Total amount spent
= $50 - $35
= $15

Therefore, Annika has $15 left.

Final answer: $15"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of books sold in the first year as x. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, the number of books sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

We know that the total number of books sold in the first two years is 200. Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year can be calculated as:

Number of books sold in the second year = Total books sold in the first two years - Number of books sold in the first year
= 200 - 90
= 110

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:

Total amount earned in the second year = Number of books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 110 * 20
= 2200

The final answer is: $2200"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we can employ the concept of total weekly earnings and then multiply it by the number of weeks in the month.

Watson's daily earnings are $10 per hour, and he works 10 hours a day. Therefore, his daily earnings can be expressed as:

$10/hour * 10 hours/day = $100/day

Since Watson works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings can be calculated as:

$100/day * 5 days/week = $500/week

April has 4 weeks, so his total earnings for the month can be calculated as:

$500/week * 4 weeks = $2000

Additionally, he receives a $300 bonus for the whole month. Therefore, his total earnings for April would be:

$2000 + $300 = $2300

The final answer is: $2300"
"To determine the number of people John lost to, we can calculate the percentage of people he lost as a decimal and then multiply it by the total number of people he arm-wrestled.

Given that John beats 80% of the people, he loses 20%. 

20% can be represented as 0.2 in decimal form. 

Now, we multiply 0.2 by the total number of people (20) to find the number of people John lost to:

0.2 * 20 = 4

Therefore, John lost to 4 people."
"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we must first calculate the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of these loaves are sold in the morning. This can be calculated as:

(2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

The number of loaves remaining after the morning sales is then:

60 - 40 = 20 loaves

Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, we can calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon as:

(1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we can use the concept of proportional reasoning. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can set up a proportion to find the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Let x be the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. We can set up the proportion as follows:

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 8 pounds / x weeks

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

8x = 8 * 4
8x = 32

Now, we can divide both sides by 8:

x = 32 / 8
x = 4

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the total savings, we need to determine the original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk, and then subtract the total cost at the discounted price.

The original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 × $13 = $26.
The original cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 × $0.5 = $2.
The total original cost is $26 + $2 = $28.

The discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 × $11 = $22.
The discounted cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 × $0.5 = $2.
The total discounted cost is $22 + $2 = $24.

The savings can be calculated as the difference between the original cost and the discounted cost: $28 - $24 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the total number of new limbs, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. We'll calculate the number of complete growth cycles for the extra arms and legs within the 15-day period.

For the extra arms, we divide 15 days by the growth interval of 3 days: 15 ÷ 3 = 5. This indicates that the person will experience 5 complete growth cycles, resulting in 5 extra arms.

Similarly, for the extra legs, we divide 15 days by the growth interval of 5 days: 15 ÷ 5 = 3. This indicates that the person will experience 3 complete growth cycles, resulting in 3 extra legs.

The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and legs: 5 (arms) + 3 (legs) = 8.

Therefore, the person will grow a total of 8 new limbs after 15 days.

Final answer: 8"
"To determine the amount Theo has to spend on gifts, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased.

The cost of 6 business suits can be calculated as 6 * $100 = $600. The cost of 3 suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150. Additionally, the flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, which is 5 * $100 = $500. Therefore, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

The total cost of items purchased so far is $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo's total budget is $6000, and he wishes to save $2000, leaving him with $6000 - $2000 = $4000 for gifts.

The final answer is: $4000"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of eggs consumed by the three individuals who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two individuals who eat two eggs each day.

Let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed per day by the three individuals who eat three eggs each day. This can be represented as 3 × 3 = 9 eggs per day.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of eggs consumed per day by the two individuals who eat two eggs each day. This can be represented as 2 × 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Now, we can find the total number of eggs consumed per day by adding the two values: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the total number of eggs consumed per day by 7 to find the total number of eggs consumed in a week: 13 × 7 = 91 eggs.

Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 91.

The final answer is: $\boxed{91}$"

1. Q = 30
2. J = Q - 3
3. T = J + 5

Substituting the value of Q into equation (2), we get:
J = 30 - 3
J = 27

Now, substituting the value of J into equation (3), we get:
T = 27 + 5
T = 32

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward approach by utilizing the given information and applying basic algebraic techniques.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and the current population of Chile as P. We are given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, who is currently 46 years old. This implies that six years ago, Noah was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:

Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * Noah's age six years ago
Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * 40
Population of Chile six years ago = 120,000

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can set up the equation:

Population of Chile six years ago = (1/2) * Current population of Chile
120,000 = (1/2) * P
P = 120,000 * 2
P = 240,000

Therefore, the current population of Chile is 240,000.

The final answer is: $oxed{240,000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. We know that the total number of players is 105. 

We can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2: 
2x + 4x + x = 210
Combine like terms: 7x = 210
Divide both sides by 7: x = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the number of people who show up for Martha's party, we need to consider the total number of people invited and the number of people who are unable to attend.

First, let's calculate the total number of people invited. There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people. Additionally, there are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people. The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Next, we need to account for the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness. We subtract these from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Furthermore, 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come had previous commitments. To find this number, we calculate 8 / 4 = 2. We then subtract these 2 people from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To calculate the total weight of marbles, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to find the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. Solomon bought 20 marbles and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

Let's calculate 2/5 of 20:
(2/5) * 20 = (2 * 20) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. Now, we can find the total number of marbles:
Total marbles = 20 (bought) + 8 (given by father) = 28 marbles.

Next, we add the marbles from the store to the marbles Solomon bought and his father gave him:
Total marbles = 50 (in the store) + 28 (bought and given) = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we can multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight:
Total weight = 78 marbles * 2kgs = 156kgs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To calculate the cost of filling the pool, we need to determine the volume of the pool first. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is:

Volume = Length x Width x Height

In this case, the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the height (or depth) is 5 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Volume = 6 ft x 4 ft x 5 ft
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, the total cost to fill the pool can be calculated as:

Total Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
Total Cost = 120 cubic feet x $0.1 per cubic foot
Total Cost = $12

Therefore, the total cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To determine the total number of children in the classroom, we can utilize the given information to establish a system of equations. Let's denote the number of boys as B, the number of girls as G, and the number of nongendered children as N.

We are given that the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, so we can express this as G = 3B. We are also given that the classroom has 30 boys, so B = 30.

Substituting B = 30 into the equation G = 3B, we find that G = 3(30) = 90.

Furthermore, we know that the number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys, so N = 1/10 * B = 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can calculate the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: Total = B + G + N = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To determine the number of electric poles required, we can utilize the concept of ratios. Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to solve for the number of electric poles.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as x. The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, so we can write the proportion as:

x / 3 = 1 / 3

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3x = 1 × 3
3x = 3

Now, we can divide both sides by 3 to isolate x:

x = 3 / 3
x = 1

However, this represents the number of electric poles per set of 3 electric wires. Since the total number of electric wires is 45, we need to multiply the number of electric poles per set by the total number of sets. 

The total number of sets is 45 ÷ 3 = 15. Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is:

x × 15 = 1 × 15
x = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of women left at the party, we can employ a straightforward approach. Let's denote the total number of people at the party as 'T'. We know that 25 men and 15 women were initially present, so T = 25 + 15 = 40.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, the number of people who departed is (1/4)T = (1/4)(40) = 10.

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party, which implies that 25 - 22 = 3 men left. This aligns with the total number of people who departed, confirming our calculation.

Now, to find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women: 15 - (1/4)T = 15 - (1/4)(40) = 15 - 10 = 5.

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the cost of the pen, we can analyze the given information using basic algebra. Let's denote the cost of the magazine as M and the cost of the pen as P.

From the given information, we know that the magazine costs half as much as the book, which costs $4. This can be expressed as:

M = 1/2 * 4
M = 2

We also know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so we can express this as:

P = M - 1
P = 2 - 1
P = 1

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the total number of pencils, we can start by adding the number of pencils Jam has to the number of pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 3 * 24 (assuming each box has 24 pencils) + 2 = 74.

Adding Meg's pencils, the total number of pencils is 74 + 46 = 120.

Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 24 to find the number of boxes needed.

120 / 24 = 5

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.

Final answer: 5"
"To determine the total weakening of Shannon's iced coffee, we must consider the combined effects of cooling and added cream. 

Let's break down the problem into two components: the weakening caused by cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream. 

The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, it means 5 ice cubes were used (65 / 13 = 5). 

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To solve this problem, we can apply the concept of ratios. The given information states that 2 old records are traded for 1 new record. This establishes a ratio of 2:1, where 2 old records are equivalent to 1 new record.

We are told that 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records. To find the total number of old records traded, we can set up a proportion using the ratio:

2 old records / 1 new record = x old records / 7 new records

Cross-multiplying, we get:

2 * 7 = 1 * x
14 = x

However, this represents the total number of old records traded by all 5 people. To find the number of old records each person brought in, we can divide the total number of old records by 5:

x / 5 = 14 / 5
x = 2.8

Since we can't trade a fraction of a record, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can use the exact value to find the number of old records each person brought in:

2.8 old records/person * 5 people = 14 old records

But since we can't trade a fraction of a record, we can use the ratio to find the number of old records each person brought in. We know that 2 old records are equivalent to 1 new record, so we can multiply the number of new records each person got by 2:

1 new record/person * 2 = 2 old records/person

Now, we multiply the number of people by the number of old records each person brought in:

5 people * 2 old records/person = 10 old records

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 10 old records.

The final answer is: 10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of junior and senior programmers, and their respective salaries.

First, we need to find the number of junior programmers, which is 2/5 of the total number of employees. This can be calculated as:

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100
= 2/5 * 100
= 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the salary of a senior programmer is:

Salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month:

Total amount for junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of a junior programmer
= 40 * $2000
= $80,000

Similarly, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month:

Total amount for senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of a senior programmer
= 60 * $2400
= $144,000

Finally, we can find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month by adding the amounts for junior and senior programmers:

Total amount = Total amount for junior programmers + Total amount for senior programmers
= $80,000 + $144,000
= $224,000

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To determine the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as x.

We know that 5 people got on at the first stop, and 7 people got off at the second stop. At the second stop, 8 more people got on. Therefore, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is x + 5 + 8 - 7.

Since we are given that there were 20 people heading to the third stop, we can set up the equation:

x + 5 + 8 - 7 = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 6 = 20

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get:

x = 14

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, we can break down the events as follows:

1. Initially, Oscar has 24 lollipops.
2. He consumes 2 lollipops on his way to school, reducing his total to 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.
3. He distributes 14 lollipops to his friends, resulting in 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops remaining.
4. Oscar then acquires twice as many lollipops as he gave away, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. This brings his total to 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He consumes 3 lollipops that night, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.
6. Finally, he consumes 2 more lollipops in the morning, resulting in 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

Therefore, Oscar has 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"To determine the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can establish a proportion to calculate the required time.

Let's denote the total time as 't' minutes. Since the phone is currently at 60% charged, it needs 40% more charge. We can set up the following proportion:

(1/3) : 40% = t : 100%

To solve for 't', we can cross-multiply and simplify:

t = (100% * 3) / 40%
t = 300% / 40%
t = 7.5 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

t = 7.5 / 60
t = 0.125 hours

Therefore, it will take 0.125 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: 0.125"
"To determine the number of lollipops Erin has left, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops Erin has after receiving additional lollipops from her mother. This can be done by adding the initial number of lollipops (7) to the number of lollipops her mother gave her (10). The result is 7 + 10 = 17.

Next, we need to subtract the number of lollipops Erin gave to Ella (3) from the total number of lollipops she had after receiving additional lollipops. This can be calculated as 17 - 3 = 14.

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

Final answer: 14"
"To determine the amount the customer paid, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we calculate the total rewards earned by dividing the total amount spent ($80) by the reward threshold ($20). This gives us 80 / 20 = 4 rewards.

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the actual rewards they received is 4 * 2 = 8 dollars.

Now, we subtract the rewards from the total amount spent: 80 - 8 = 72.

Therefore, the customer paid $72 on this shopping trip.

The final answer is: $72"
"To determine which job provides a higher net pay, we must consider the tax implications for each option.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Annual salary: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net pay for each job, we find that Job B provides a higher net pay rate of $32,400. To determine the difference in net pay, we subtract the lower net pay from the higher net pay:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To determine the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we can apply the concept of percentages and fractions. 

First, we calculate 40% of 220, which is equivalent to 0.4 * 220. 

0.4 * 220 = 88

Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we can express this as a fraction: 1/2. To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we multiply 88 by 1/2.

88 * (1/2) = 88/2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

First, we calculate the increase in the stock price: 50% of $8 is $4. The new price after the first year is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, we calculate the decrease in the second year: 25% of $12 is $3. The new price after the second year is $12 - $3 = $9.

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is 8 * $9 = $72.

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To determine the number of hot dogs John ate more than Luke, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of hot dogs Luke ate as L and the number of hot dogs John ate as J.

We are given that Luke ate 2 hot dogs, so L = 2.

We also know that Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so the number of hot dogs Thomas ate is 3L = 3(2) = 6.

Since John ate half the amount Thomas ate, we can express this as J = (1/2)(6) = 3.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: J - L = 3 - 2 = 1.

Therefore, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. Since the other two groups are equal in number, each of them has 2x students. The total number of students is 200, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 2x = 200

Combine like terms:

5x = 200

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 40

Therefore, the smallest group has 40 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the total number of legs on the farm, we can utilize the principle of linear equations. Let's denote the number of cows as 'c' and the number of chickens as '2c', since the problem states that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows.

We are given that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

c + 2c = 60

Combining like terms, we get:

3c = 60

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

c = 20

Now that we know the number of cows, we can calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

4c + 2(2c) = 4(20) + 2(40) = 80 + 80 = 160

The total number of legs on the farm is 160."
"To determine the number of balls Josh has left to juggle, we can calculate the total number of balls he had at the end of the fourth week and then subtract the number of balls he lost.

Josh started with 3 balls and added 1 ball each week. This forms an arithmetic sequence with a first term of 3 and a common difference of 1. The number of balls at the end of the fourth week can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:

an = a1 + (n - 1)d

where an is the number of balls at the end of the fourth week, a1 is the first term (3), n is the number of weeks (4), and d is the common difference (1).

an = 3 + (4 - 1)1
an = 3 + 3
an = 6

Since Josh lost 1 ball, the number of balls he has left is:

6 - 1 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a series of equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the weight of the pink frog as P, the weight of the blue beetle as B, the weight of the green toad as T, the weight of the yellow snake as S, the weight of the red bird as R, and the weight of the container as C.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. P = B
2. P = T
3. P = S - 10
4. P = R + 20
5. C = 20

We are also given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, so we can substitute P = 50 into equations (1), (2), and (3):

50 = B
50 = T
50 = S - 10

Solving for S, we get:

S = 60

Now, we can substitute P = 50 into equation (4) to find the weight of the red bird:

50 = R + 20
R = 30

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:

Total weight = P + B + T + S + C
= 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 20
= 190

The final answer is: $\boxed{190}$"
"To determine the total number of baby outfits, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the number of outfits received at the baby shower, which is twice the amount given by Laurel's friend. This can be expressed as 2 * 24.

Total outfits from friend and baby shower = 2 * 24 = 48

Next, we add the outfits gifted by Laurel's mom to the total. 

Total outfits = 48 + 15

Now, we perform the addition to find the total number of outfits.

Total outfits = 48 + 15
Total outfits = 63

The final answer is: $\boxed{63}$"
"To calculate the total distance covered in June, we need to consider the increased daily distance and the number of days in the month.

Given that Tyson's original daily distance is 5000 meters and his coach recommends an increase of 1/5 times this amount, we can calculate the new daily distance as follows:

New daily distance = 5000 + (1/5) * 5000
= 5000 + 1000
= 6000 meters

Since June has 30 days, the total distance covered in June can be calculated as:

Total distance = New daily distance * Number of days
= 6000 * 30
= 180,000 meters

Therefore, the total distance covered in June is 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180,000}$"
"To determine the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we establish the price of each juice box: Juice Box A is $4, Juice Box B is $4 + $5 = $9, and Juice Box C is $4 + $7 = $11.

The difference in price between Juice Box C and Juice Box B can be calculated as follows: $11 - $9 = $2.

Therefore, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B.

"To calculate the total number of legs, we can utilize the concept of weighted averages. Let's assign variables to represent the number of tables and legs:

Let T4 be the number of tables with 4 legs and T3 be the number of tables with 3 legs.

We are given that T4 = 40 and T3 = 50.

The total number of legs can be represented as:

Total Legs = (4 * T4) + (3 * T3)
= (4 * 40) + (3 * 50)
= 160 + 150
= 310

Therefore, the total number of legs in the restaurant is 310."
"To determine the number of cookies Jenny eats, we must first calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

The son's daily cookie consumption is 4 cookies, and he eats for 5 days, resulting in a total of 4 cookies/day * 5 days = 20 cookies.

The husband's daily cookie consumption is 1 cookie, and he eats for 7 days, resulting in a total of 1 cookie/day * 7 days = 7 cookies.

The combined total of cookies consumed by the son and husband is 20 cookies + 7 cookies = 27 cookies.

Since the bag contains 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 cookies - 27 cookies = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To calculate the total cost of the two shirts after applying a 40% discount, we can use the formula:

Total Cost = (Original Price - Discount) * Quantity

Given:
Original Price of one shirt = $30
Discount = 40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12
Quantity = 2

Total Cost = ($30 - $12) * 2
= $18 * 2
= $36

Therefore, the total cost of the two shirts after applying a 40% discount is $36."
"To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue, we need to calculate the difference in revenue between the tractor and silo production.

The factory's original revenue from tractors was $1000 per day, and their current revenue from silos is $1100 per day. To find the difference, we'll subtract the original revenue from the current revenue:

$1100 - $1000 = $100

Now, we'll divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100 to find the percentage increase:

($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

Final Answer: The final answer is 10%."
"To determine the total yearly expenditure on dog care, we must first calculate the monthly expenditure and then multiply it by 12.

The monthly expenditure consists of the weekly cost of food, which is $25 per week, multiplied by 4 weeks, resulting in $100 per month. Additionally, there is a monthly cost of $20 for treats and $100 for medicine. Therefore, the total monthly expenditure is $100 + $20 + $100 = $220.

To find the yearly expenditure, we multiply the monthly expenditure by 12:

$220 * 12 = $2,640

The final answer is: $2640"
"To determine the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we can break down the problem into individual components and calculate the time for each activity.

First, we have a one-hour yoga class on Monday. This is a straightforward calculation.

Next, we have a cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday's yoga class. Since Monday's yoga class is 1 hour, the cooking class will be 3 * 1 = 3 hours.

On Wednesday, Peyton attends a half-hour cheese-tasting event, which can be represented as 0.5 hours.

The museum tour on Thursday takes half as long as the cooking class, so it will be 1.5 hours.

Finally, Peyton dedicates two hours to errands on Friday.

Now, let's add up the hours for each activity:

1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7.5 hours

Therefore, the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we must first calculate the total number of pots required. Since she needs 30 pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses, we can express this as an equation:

Let's denote the number of pots for the daisies as D and the number of pots for the roses as R. We know that R = 2D and D = 30. Therefore, R = 2 * 30 = 60.

The total number of pots required is the sum of the pots for the daisies and roses: Total = D + R = 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April already had 100 plant pots, we can find the number of pots left over by subtracting the total number of pots required from the initial amount: 100 - 90 = 10.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To determine the amount Andrea saved, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

Let's denote the initial amount Andrea had as 'x'. We know that she spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4. The total amount she spent is the sum of these two expenses, which is $11 + $4 = $15. 

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x - $15 = $36

To solve for 'x', we can add $15 to both sides of the equation:

x = $36 + $15
x = $51

However, this is the total amount Andrea had initially. To find the amount she saved, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount. 

The amount Andrea saved is $51 - $15 = $36.

Therefore, Andrea saved $36."
"To determine the total time John spent on vacation, we can break down his activities into separate components and calculate the time spent on each.

First, we calculate the time spent on boating and swimming. Since John spends half the time swimming compared to boating, we can express this as:

Time spent swimming = (1/2) * Time spent boating
Time spent swimming = (1/2) * 6
Time spent swimming = 3 hours

Next, we calculate the time spent watching shows. Since John watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours, we can express this as:

Time spent watching shows = 3 * 2
Time spent watching shows = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate the total time spent on these activities:

Total time spent on boating and swimming = Time spent boating + Time spent swimming
Total time spent on boating and swimming = 6 + 3
Total time spent on boating and swimming = 9 hours

Total time spent on these activities = Total time spent on boating and swimming + Time spent watching shows
Total time spent on these activities = 9 + 6
Total time spent on these activities = 15 hours

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time:

0.3x = 15
x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50

This means John spent 50 hours on vacation.

To find the time spent sightseeing, we can calculate 40% of the total time:

Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount Annabelle still needs to save, we can calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add it to her initial savings.

Let's break down her earnings:

Her earnings from the first job: 20 hours * $10/hour = $200
Her earnings from the second job: 15 hours * $5/hour = $75
Total earnings: $200 + $75 = $275

Now, let's add her initial savings: $80 + $275 = $355

To find out how much she still needs to save, we subtract her total earnings and initial savings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45

The final answer is: $45"
"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the height of the shortest tree as x. Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, its height can be represented as x + 5. The combined height of the two shortest trees is x + (x + 5), which simplifies to 2x + 5.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shortest trees, so it can be expressed as 2(2x + 5). Simplifying this expression yields 4x + 10.

We are given that the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, so x = 6. Substituting this value into the expression for the tallest tree's height, we get 4(6) + 10 = 24 + 10 = 34 feet.

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the amount of money Dean has left, we can employ the concept of subtraction. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the items Dean purchased. The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is 6 * $2 = $12. The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is 5 * $1 = $5. The total cost of the items is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. To find the amount of money he has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $28 - $17 = $11.

However, his mother then gives him an extra $10. To find the final amount, we add this to the remaining amount: $11 + $10 = $21.

Therefore, Dean now has $21.

The final answer is $21."
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and subtract that from her budget.

Let's break down the costs:

- The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5. Since she wants to play once, the total cost for mini-golf is $5.
- The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride. She wants to ride the go-karts twice, so the total cost for go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.
- The total cost of the activities is $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) = $25.

Now, let's subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 (budget) - $25 (total cost) = $65.

Since each friend will also get $5 in arcade tokens, we need to subtract that from the remaining budget as well: $65 - $5 = $60.

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend (including the arcade tokens): $60 / $5 = 12.

Therefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party.

Final Answer: The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total amount Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate the daily change and then multiply it by the number of days.

Daily pocket money: $5
Cost of each lollipop: $0.25
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4

First, calculate the total cost of lollipops per day:
Total cost of lollipops per day = Number of lollipops * Cost of each lollipop
Total cost of lollipops per day = 4 * $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day = $1

Since Marisa saves the change, we need to subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
Daily change = Daily pocket money - Total cost of lollipops per day
Daily change = $5 - $1
Daily change = $4

Now, multiply the daily change by the number of days to find the total amount saved:
Total amount saved = Daily change * Number of days
Total amount saved = $4 * 5
Total amount saved = $20

Therefore, Marisa saves $20 in her piggy bank for 5 days.

Final answer: $20"
"To determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to find the total amount of money Billy had initially. Since he had $10 and spent $2 on gumballs, the amount left is $10 - $2 = $8.

Next, we know that the candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought, we can divide the amount spent on candy ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5).

Let's perform the calculation: 

$2 ÷ $1.5 = 1.33 pounds

Therefore, Billy bought 1.33 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.33}$"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize algebraic techniques to isolate the variable representing the son's age. Let's denote the son's age as S and the father's age as C. We are given that C = 45.

The given information can be translated into the equation:

C = 2S - 5

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get:

45 = 2S - 5

Adding 5 to both sides of the equation, we obtain:

50 = 2S

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:

S = 25

Therefore, the son's age is 25.

25"
"To determine the number of days between services, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in one trip and then divide it by the service interval.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance).

The total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval:

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days

To convert days to hours, we multiply by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):

0.0375 days * 24 hours/day = 0.9 hours

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

0.9 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 54 minutes

The train goes between services for approximately 54 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0.0375}$"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing needed, we must first calculate the amount required for each type of bed. 

The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is the mean of the stuffing required for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds, which is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

To make 4 chihuahua beds, Mark needs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.

To make 3 collie beds, Mark needs 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

The total amount of stuffing needed is the sum of the amounts required for the chihuahua and collie beds, which is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To calculate the total time taken for the trip, we can break it down into three segments: the trip to the friend's house, the detour, and the return trip.

First, let's calculate the time taken for each segment:

Time taken to drive to the friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

The detour added 10 miles to the trip, so the total distance to the friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. However, since the detour was only 10 miles, we can calculate the time taken for the detour as:
Time taken for the detour = Distance / Speed = 10 / 70 = 0.14 hours

Time taken to drive back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Now, we can calculate the total time taken for the trip:
Total time taken = Time taken to drive to the friend's house + Time taken for the detour + Time taken to drive back home
Total time taken = 2.86 + 0.14 + 3 = 5.99 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5.99}$"
"To determine the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we can utilize the principle of set theory. Let's break down the information provided:

Total number of students = 96
Number of girls = 43
Number of absent girls = 5
Number of absent boys = 4

We can calculate the number of boys present by subtracting the total number of absent students from the total number of students and then subtracting the number of absent girls.

Number of boys present = Total students - Total absent students
= 96 - (5 + 4)
= 96 - 9
= 87

Therefore, the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 87."
"To determine the total number of kids in the park, we can utilize the concept of ratios. Given that there are twice as many boys as girls, we can express this relationship as a ratio of boys to girls, which is 2:1. 

Since the total number of girls is 6, we can use this information to find the number of boys. 

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 6
Number of boys = 12

Now, we can calculate the total number of kids by adding the number of boys and girls.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 12 + 6
Total number of kids = 18

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we can set up an inequality based on the total points required. Let x be the points scored on the third test.

The total points from all three tests must be at least 42, so we can write the inequality:

15 + 18 + x ≥ 42

Combine the constants on the left side:

33 + x ≥ 42

Subtract 33 from both sides:

x ≥ 9

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test to meet the requirement.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as y, and the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as z.

We are given the following information:

1. x = 3 (number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks)
2. y = 4x - 5 (number of customers kicked out for shoplifting)
3. z = 3y (number of customers kicked out for physical violence)

We are also given that the total number of customers kicked out is 50. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + y + z = 50

Substituting the expressions for y and z from equations (2) and (3), we get:

x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms:

17x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

17x = 70

Divide both sides by 17:

x = 70/17
x = 4.1176 (approximately)

Now that we have the value of x, we can find y and z:

y = 4x - 5
y = 4(4.1176) - 5
y ≈ 11.4714

z = 3y
z ≈ 3(11.4714)
z ≈ 34.4132

Since the number of customers must be a whole number, we can round x, y, and z to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are asked for the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, which is the total number of customers minus the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks and shoplifting.

Number of customers kicked out for other reasons = Total customers - (customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks + customers kicked out for shoplifting)
= 50 - (3 + 11)
= 50 - 14
= 36

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic manipulation. Let's denote the number of points Sara had before scoring 8 as x. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara after scoring 8, we can set up the equation:

Erin's points after scoring 8 = 3(Sara's points after scoring 8) + 8

We know Erin scored 14 points after scoring 8, so we can set up the equation:

14 = 3(Sara's points after scoring 8) + 8

First, we need to find Sara's points after scoring 8. Let's denote Sara's points after scoring 8 as y. Then, we can rewrite the equation as:

14 = 3y + 8

Subtract 8 from both sides:

6 = 3y

Divide both sides by 3:

2 = y

Now that we know Sara's points after scoring 8, we can find Erin's points after scoring 8:

Erin's points after scoring 8 = 3y + 8
= 3(2) + 8
= 6 + 8
= 14

However, we want to find Erin's points before scoring 8. Since Erin scored 8 points, we can set up the equation:

Erin's points before scoring 8 = Erin's points after scoring 8 - 8
= 14 - 8
= 6

The correct answer is 6."
"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we can break down the expenses into distinct components.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and an additional 20% of this cost is required for etching the logo. This can be calculated as:

$20 + (20% of $20) = $20 + $4 = $24 per frame

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost for the picture frames is:

44 * $24 = $1056

Next, we need to account for the pins. Two seniors will receive pins, each costing $5. The total cost for the pins is:

2 * $5 = $10

Additionally, 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 11 seniors. Each officer requires a cord costing $12. The total cost for the cords is:

11 * $12 = $132

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the costs of the picture frames, pins, and cords:

$1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198

Therefore, the total cost for the senior gifts is $1198."
"When calculating the cost of a DIY hand-painted wallpaper, it's essential to consider the original cost and the discount. In this scenario, the original cost is $400, and the discount is 20% of that amount.

To find the total cost for the DIY project, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = Original Cost - (Original Cost * Discount Rate)

Plugging in the values, we get:

Total Cost = $400 - ($400 * 0.20)
Total Cost = $400 - $80
Total Cost = $320

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To calculate the total number of tennis shoes sold, we can break down the sales by day and then account for the returns.

Let's denote the number of shoes sold on Friday as F, Saturday as S, and Sunday as D. We're given that F = 14. The number of shoes sold on Saturday is double the amount sold on Friday, so S = 2F = 2(14) = 28. On Sunday, the store sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, so D = S/2 = 28/2 = 14.

However, we need to account for the returns. The total number of shoes sold is the sum of the shoes sold on each day minus the returns: Total = F + S + D - Returns. We're told that 6 people returned their shoes, so the total number of shoes sold is 14 + 28 + 14 - 6.

Total = 14 + 28 + 14 - 6
Total = 50 - 6
Total = 44

The final answer is 44."
"To determine the total hours of dance practice per week, we can calculate the total hours by adding the hours for each day.

Hallie's dance practice schedule can be broken down as follows:

- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 2 hours
- Saturday: 2 hours (twice as long as Tuesday's night class)

Total hours per week = Tuesday hours + Thursday hours + Saturday hours
= 1 + 2 + 2
= 5 hours

Therefore, Hallie has 5 hours of dance practice per week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To calculate the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote the total number of pieces as x. Since 40% of the equipment were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is 0.4x. The number of functioning pieces is then x - 0.4x = 0.6x.

The total amount spent on all pieces is $400,000. The amount spent on faulty pieces is 0.4x. Therefore, the amount spent on functioning pieces is 400,000 - 0.4x.

Since we know that 0.6x represents the number of functioning pieces, we can set up the equation:

0.6x = 400,000 - 0.4x

Combine like terms:

0.6x + 0.4x = 400,000

1x = 400,000

x = 400,000

Now that we know the total number of pieces is 400,000, we can find the number of functioning pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = 0.6x
= 0.6 * 400,000
= 240,000

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 400,000 - 0.4 * 400,000
= 400,000 - 160,000
= 240,000

Therefore, the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"To determine the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic series. 

Since Mary gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep and 2 kg from the other half, we can calculate the total milk collected as follows:

Let's denote the number of sheep as 'n'. Since Mary gets milk from half of the sheep, the number of sheep providing 1 kg of milk is n/2, and the number of sheep providing 2 kg of milk is also n/2.

The total milk collected from the first half is (n/2) * 1 = n/2 kg.
The total milk collected from the second half is (n/2) * 2 = n kg.

The total milk collected is the sum of the milk from both halves: n/2 + n = 3n/2 kg.

Given that Mary has 30 sheep, we can substitute n = 30 into the equation:

Total milk collected = 3n/2 = 3(30)/2 = 45 kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"To determine the number of pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we must first calculate the number of rolls remaining after feeding her 6 children. Since a dozen is equivalent to 12, we can express this as:

12 - 6 = 6

This can be represented mathematically as:

12 - 6 = 6

Next, we need to find the total number of pieces by multiplying the remaining rolls by 8 (since each roll is broken into 8 pieces). This can be expressed as:

6 × 8 = 48

Therefore, the total number of pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens is 48.

Final answer: 48"
"To determine the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we find the number of pupils who like blue, which is half of the total class size: 40 / 2 = 20.

Next, we calculate the number of remaining pupils: 40 - 20 = 20.

Then, we find the number of pupils who like green, which is one-fourth of the remaining pupils: 20 / 4 = 5.

Finally, we calculate the number of pupils who like yellow by subtracting the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils: 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, the number of pupils who like yellow is 15."
"To determine the total number of apples picked by Lucy over the three days, we can analyze the given information.

Let's denote the number of apples picked on Monday as M, Tuesday as T, and Wednesday as W. We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday, so the total amount of money she received from selling those apples is $56. Since each apple is sold at $4, we can set up the equation:

4M = 56

Solving for M, we get:

M = 56 / 4
M = 14

Now, we are given that Lucy picked double the number of apples on Wednesday compared to Tuesday. Therefore, we can express W as:

W = 2T
W = 2(12)
W = 24

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked by adding the number of apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:

Total = M + T + W
Total = 14 + 12 + 24
Total = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we can calculate the total number of socks she has washed and subtract that from the total number of socks.

Let's break it down:

Total number of socks = 50
Number of pairs of socks washed = 10
Number of loose socks washed = 15

Since each pair of socks consists of 2 socks, the total number of socks washed can be calculated as:
2 * (number of pairs) + number of loose socks
= 2 * 10 + 15
= 20 + 15
= 35

Now, we subtract the total number of socks washed from the total number of socks to find the number of socks Lindsay has missed:
50 - 35 = 15

Therefore, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"To determine the number of cookies left for Rachel, we must consider the sequence of events that affected the total number of cookies.

Initially, Rachel had 23 cookies. Janet gave her 42 cookies, increasing the total to 23 + 42 = 65 cookies.

However, her brother then consumed 44 cookies, reducing the total to 65 - 44 = 21 cookies.

Therefore, the number of cookies left for Rachel is 21.

Final answer: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine Karan's monthly payment, we can use the formula for calculating monthly payments on a loan:

M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n - 1]

where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal amount = $3,650
i = monthly interest rate = 10%/12 = 0.008333
n = number of payments = 5 months

Plugging in the values, we get:

M = $3,650 [ 0.008333(1 + 0.008333)^5 ] / [ (1 + 0.008333)^5 - 1]
M = $3,650 [ 0.008333(1.008333)^5 ] / (1.008333)^5 - 1]
M = $3,650 [ 0.008333(1.043383) ] / 1.043383 - 1]
M = $3,650 [ 0.008745 ] / 1.043383 - 1]
M = $3,650 [ 0.008745 ] / 0.043383]
M = $83.33

The final answer is: $83.33"
"To determine the distance each individual hiked, we can apply the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time.

For Cho, the distance hiked is calculated as follows:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 14 km/h × 8 h
Distance = 112 km

For Chloe, the distance hiked is calculated as follows:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 9 km/h × 5 h
Distance = 45 km

To find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe, we subtract the distance hiked by Chloe from the distance hiked by Cho:

Difference = Distance hiked by Cho - Distance hiked by Chloe
Difference = 112 km - 45 km
Difference = 67 km

The correct answer is: 67"
"To determine the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they possess.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To determine the profit per hour, we must first calculate the total revenue and total cost. 

The total revenue is the number of cups sold multiplied by the price per cup. Since Millie sells 4 cups per hour and she sells all 36 cups, the total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

The total cost is the initial investment, which is $18.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $36 - $18 = $18.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 ÷ 9 hours = $2 per hour.

Therefore, the profit per hour is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportions. Let's denote the original amount of land as x hectares. Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We can set up the equation:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the number of people who sang in the performance, we first need to calculate the total number of female members in the choir. Given that 50% of the 52 members are girls, we can calculate this as 0.5 * 52 = 26.

Since half of the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find half of the total number of people performing. The total number of people performing is the number of girls (26) plus the 3 teachers, which is 26 + 3 = 29. Half of 29 is 29 / 2 = 14.5. However, since we can't have half a person, we'll round down to 14.

The total number of people performing is 26 (girls) + 3 (teachers) - 14 (half of the performers) = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To calculate Wilson's current math grade, we need to find the average of his 5 test scores. The average is calculated by summing up all the scores and dividing by the total number of tests.

Let's denote the sum of the scores as S and the number of tests as n. We are given the scores: 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74. 

S = 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

n = 5

The average (A) is calculated as: A = S / n

A = 400 / 5

A = 80

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80."
"To calculate the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. 

First, we multiply the number of erasers by the cost of one eraser: 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, we multiply the number of pencils by the cost of one pencil: 8 * $3 = $24.

Finally, we add the two amounts together: $12 + $24 = $36.

Therefore, the total cost is $36."
"To determine the total number of messages James delivers, we can utilize the concept of proportional reasoning. Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can set up a proportion to find the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu.

Let x be the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu. The proportion can be set up as follows:

(1/3) = x / 66

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

x = (1/3) * 66
x = 22

Now, we can find the total number of messages by adding the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:

Total number of messages = 66 + 22
Total number of messages = 88

Therefore, James delivers a total of 88 messages."
"To determine the amount David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying 9 ride tickets and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. Therefore, he saves $30 - $18 = $12.

However, we can also consider the scenario from Dasha's perspective. If Dasha buys 9 ride tickets, the cost is $18. If she buys a ride bracelet, the cost is $30.

In this case, Dasha spends $18 if she buys tickets and $30 if she buys a bracelet. To find out how much David saves, we need to compare the costs. 

David saves $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is $12."
"To determine the amount of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon she has by the number of gifts she wants to make bows for.

Total gifts = 6 (for family) + 4 (for friends) + 2 (for teachers) = 12 gifts
Total ribbon = 144 inches

Ribbon per gift = Total ribbon / Total gifts
Ribbon per gift = 144 / 12
Ribbon per gift = 12 inches

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, which means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. 

Let's represent the number of popsicles Betty has as 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has as 6x, where x is a common multiplier. The total number of popsicles they have together is 165, so we can set up the equation:

5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms:
11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 15

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
Betty: 5x = 5(15) = 75
Sam: 6x = 6(15) = 90

To find the difference in the number of popsicles Sam has more than Betty, subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling. To calculate the discounted cost, we need to find 20% of $10 and subtract it from the original cost.

20% of $10 is calculated as 0.20 * $10 = $2. 

The discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.

To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42

Therefore, Tim saves $42 per month by cancelling his cable package.

The final answer is: $42"
"To calculate the percentage of time spent editing, we must first convert the time spent recording from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 90 minutes is equivalent to 1.5 hours.

The total work time is the sum of the time spent writing, recording, and editing: 4 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 7 hours.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of time spent editing:

(1.5 hours / 7 hours) * 100 = 21.43%

Therefore, Carol spent approximately 21.43% of her total work time editing."
"To determine the total number of books Wendy needs, we must first calculate the capacity of the shelving system. Given that it has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity can be found by multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns: 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Next, we need to find double the capacity, which is 2 * 36 = 72 books. To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we add 20 more to this value: 72 + 20 = 92 books.

Therefore, Wendy will need 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: $\boxed{92}$"
"To determine the total number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we can employ a straightforward approach by adding the initial number of cards she made, the cards she received, and then subtracting the cards she gave away.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initial cards: Erica made 20 cards.
2. Cards received: She received 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, the total number of cards received is 2 * 15 = 30.
3. Total initial cards: 20 (made) + 30 (received) = 50.
4. Cards given away: Erica gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards given away.
5. Total cards Erica now has: 50 (initial cards) + 17 (received) - 29 (given away) = 38.

Therefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

Final answer: 38"
"To determine the number of slices left, we must first calculate the total number of slices given away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is equivalent to (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices. Similarly, she gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is equivalent to (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

The total number of slices given away is the sum of the slices given to Bill and Mark, which is 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny initially had 12 slices and gave away 7 slices, so she has 12 - 7 = 5 slices left.

However, Jenny also ate 2 slices, so the number of slices left is 5 - 2 = 3 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of days Mark needs to save for the bike, we can use the concept of time value of money. Since Mark earns a fixed amount of $10 per day, we can calculate the number of days required to accumulate the remaining amount needed to buy the bike.

Let's denote the number of days as 'd'. The equation to represent the situation is:

10d = 300 - 50

Simplifying the equation:

10d = 250

Dividing both sides by 10:

d = 250 / 10

d = 25

Therefore, Mark needs 25 days to save for the bike.

Final answer: 25"
"To determine the total number of bugs, we can break down the problem into its constituent parts. 

First, we calculate the number of millipedes, which is 1/3 of the number of spiders. 

Number of millipedes = (1/3) * 90 = 30

Next, we calculate the number of stink bugs, which is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 48

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs.

Total number of bugs = 90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168

Therefore, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"To determine the age difference between Alice and Erica, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Erica's age as E, Beth's age as B, and Alice's age as A.

Given that Erica is 30 years old, we can express this as E = 30.

Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can express Beth's age as B = E + 5. Substituting E = 30, we get B = 30 + 5 = 35.

Now, we are told that Alice is 7 years older than Beth. Therefore, we can express Alice's age as A = B + 7. Substituting B = 35, we get A = 35 + 7 = 42.

The age difference between Alice and Erica can be calculated as A - E = 42 - 30 = 12.

Therefore, the age difference between Alice and Erica is 12 years."
"To calculate the total calories consumed, we can apply the fundamental principles of unit conversion and multiplication.

Given:
- Number of glasses = 2
- Ounces per glass = 8
- Calories per ounce = 3

We can express this as a mathematical equation: Total calories = Number of glasses × Ounces per glass × Calories per ounce

Substituting the given values, we get: Total calories = 2 × 8 × 3

Using the associative property of multiplication, we can rearrange the equation to: Total calories = 2 × (8 × 3)

Now, we can evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 8 × 3 = 24

Finally, we multiply the result by 2: Total calories = 2 × 24 = 48

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories."
"To calculate the builder's annual earnings, we can employ the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

First, we need to determine the total number of working days in a year. Given that the builder works 4 weeks per month and there are 52 weeks in a year, we can calculate the total weeks worked as 4 weeks/month * 52 weeks/year = 208 weeks/year.

Since the builder works 6 days a week, the total number of working days in a year is 208 weeks/year * 6 days/week = 1248 days/year.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of working days by the daily wage: 1248 days/year * $50/day = $62,400/year.

The final answer is: $62,400"
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we can apply the concept of scaling a recipe by a factor of 4.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. When scaling this recipe by a factor of 4, we multiply the quantities by 4.

Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide 12 by 2 to get the number of bags: 12 / 2 = 6 bags

Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups
Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide 4 by 2 to get the number of bottles: 4 / 2 = 2 bottles

To find the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4

Therefore, Mark needs to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the energy saved, we need to first determine the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner. Since the AC uses 900 watts of energy per hour, we can calculate the daily energy consumption as follows:

Daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh)

To convert this to kilowatt-hours (kWh), we divide by 1000:

Daily energy consumption = 7200 Wh / 1000 = 7.2 kWh

Now, let's calculate the energy saved by reducing the usage from 8 hours to 3 hours per day:

Energy saved per day = 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30:

Total energy saved = 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"To calculate the average number of stripes, we must first determine the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

Let's denote the number of stripes on the first two zebras as 2 * 17 = 34, the third zebra as 36, and the fourth zebra as 36 / 2 = 18.

The total number of stripes is the sum of these values: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.

Since there are 4 zebras, we can calculate the average by dividing the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

Therefore, the average number of stripes per zebra is 22.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total cost of the muffaletta sandwiches, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we can calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed as follows:

Total number of sandwiches required = Total number of people / Number of people per sandwich
= 20 people / 4 people per sandwich
= 5 sandwiches

Now, we can calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required:

Total meat required = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich
= 5 pounds of meat

Total cheese required = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich
= 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost of the meat and cheese is:

Total cost = (Total meat required * Cost of meat per pound) + (Total cheese required * Cost of cheese per pound)
= (5 pounds * $7.00/pound) + (5 pounds * $3.00/pound)
= $35.00 + $15.00
= $50.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $50.00."
"To determine the combined total of corns and cannolis, we must first establish the initial quantities of each. We are given that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has a total of 40 cannolis. This implies that the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Next, we are informed that Allan bought 60 more cannolis, bringing the total to 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis. However, we must correct the initial quantity of corns to reflect the 40 fewer corns mentioned in the problem. Therefore, the corrected initial quantity of corns is 80 - 40 = 40.

Now, we can calculate the total number of corns after the purchase, which is 40 + 60 = 100. The total number of cannolis is 100.

The combined total of corns and cannolis is 100 + 100 = 200.

Final answer: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of steps taken during the jog as 'x'. We know that Elliott completed 5,000 steps on his walks to and from school and 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, resulting in a total of 6,000 steps before the jog. After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take, which means the total steps taken during the jog plus the remaining steps should equal 10,000.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

6,000 + x + 2,000 = 10,000

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8,000 + x = 10,000

Subtracting 8,000 from both sides yields:

x = 2,000

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

The final answer is: 2,000"
"To determine the time it will take Toby to finish the book, we can apply the formula for time, which is time = total work / rate. In this case, the total work is the number of words in the book (45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words), and the rate is Toby's reading speed (300 words per minute).

Time = Total work / Rate
Time = 9000 words / 300 words per minute
Time = 30 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to finish the book, we can calculate the time he will arrive early by subtracting the time it takes to finish the book from the total time available.

Time to arrive early = Total time available - Time to finish the book
Time to arrive early = 60 minutes - 30 minutes
Time to arrive early = 30 minutes

Therefore, Toby will arrive 30 minutes early.

The final answer is 30."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to consider the number of employees and their hourly wage.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. This results in a total of:
40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left, resulting in 30 employees remaining. The total amount paid in June is:
30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

The total amount paid in the two months is the sum of the amounts paid in May and June:
$24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

The final answer is: $42,000"
"To calculate the total cost of Sally's purchases, we can break down the items into their respective costs and sum them up.

The taffy costs $3 per pound, and Sally bought 2 pounds, so the total cost of the taffy is 2 × $3 = $6. Since the second pound is 1/2 off, its cost is $3 / 2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of the taffy is $6 + $1.50 = $7.50.

The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

The 4 magnets cost 4 × $0.25 = $1.

The total cost of all the items is $7.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $10.

Since Sally started with $10 and spent $10, we can conclude that she has $0 left.

The final answer is $0."
"To calculate the total amount Tim spent, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the total cost of the two packages of fireworks. The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice as much, which is 2 x $400 = $800. The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Next, we need to calculate the discount on the two packages. The discount is 20% of $1200, which can be calculated as 0.20 x $1200 = $240.

The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to get the total amount spent. The total amount spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we can use the following calculation:

Let's denote the number of dozens of cookies needed as x. Since Shannon eats 2 cookies per night and wants to have enough for 30 days, the total number of cookies she needs is 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we can set up the equation:

12x = 60

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 12:

x = 60 ÷ 12
x = 5

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

Final answer: 5"
"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we can apply the concept of overlapping sets. Let's break it down step by step:

Let's define two sets:
A = set of candles that smell like wet dog (5% of the total)
B = set of candles that explode (also 5% of the total)

We are given:
A = 0.05 x 50,000 = 2,500
B = 0.05 x 50,000 = 2,500

To find the number of candles that belong to both sets (A ∩ B), we can use the formula for the intersection of two sets:

|A ∩ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∪ B|

However, since we don't have the value of |A ∪ B|, we can use the fact that |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|. Rearranging the formula, we get:

|A ∩ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∪ B|

Substituting the values, we get:

|A ∩ B| = 2,500 + 2,500 - |A ∪ B|

Since |A ∪ B| is the total number of candles that smell like wet dog or explode, we can find it by adding the number of candles that smell like wet dog and the number of candles that explode, and then subtracting the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode (to avoid double-counting):

|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|

Substituting the values, we get:

|A ∪ B| = 2,500 + 2,500 - |A ∩ B|
|A ∪ B| = 5,000 - |A ∩ B|

Now, substitute this expression for |A ∪ B| back into the equation for |A ∩ B|:

|A ∩ B| = 2,500 + 2,500 - (5,000 - |A ∩ B|)
|A ∩ B| = 2,500 + 2,500 - 5,000 + |A ∩ B|
|A ∩ B| = 4,000 + |A ∩ B| - 5,000
|A ∩ B| = -2,000 + |A ∩ B|

Now, add 2,000 to both sides:

3,000 = |A ∩ B|

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 3,000.

Final answer: 3000"
"To calculate the total cost of the discounted blouses, we can apply the concept of percentage discount to the regular price of each blouse. The discount is 30% of the regular price, which can be represented as 0.3 in decimal form.

The discounted price of each blouse is the regular price minus the discount amount. In this case, the regular price is $20, and the discount is $6 (30% of $20). 

The discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses can be calculated by multiplying the discounted price by the number of blouses:

Total cost = 4 * $14 = $56

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as x, the number of apples from the shortest trees as y, and the number of apples from the average trees as z.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so x = 30. We also know that her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2x = 2(30) = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Additionally, Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so y = 15. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so her sister gathers 3y = 3(15) = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is x + 2x + y + 3y = 3x + 4y. We know that the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation:

3x + 4y + z = 500

We also know that Joanne gathers z apples from the average trees, and her sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees. Since the total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 3x + 4y, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - (3x + 4y).

Substituting the values of x and y, we get:

3(30) + 4(15) + z = 500
90 + 60 + z = 500
150 + z = 500
z = 350

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which translates to the equation: c + d = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304, considering camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, we can write the equation: 2c + d = 304.

We can solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to find the values of 'c' and 'd'.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of 'c' in both equations:
2c + 2d = 360

Now, we can subtract the second equation from this new equation to eliminate 'c':
(2c + 2d) - (2c + d) = 360 - 304
d = 56

Now that we have found 'd', we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find 'c':
c + d = 180
c + 56 = 180
c = 124

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is 56.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break it down into parts.

First, we need to find the total distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. Since he traveled 200 kilometers per day, the total distance is:

200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, we need to find the distance Tom traveled over the next two days, which is 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. To find 30% of 800 km, we multiply 800 by 0.3:

800 km * 0.3 = 240 km

Now, we add the distance traveled in the first 4 days and the next two days:

800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

Since Tom didn't travel on the next day, we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:

300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we add the distances traveled in the first 6 days and the second week:

1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

Therefore, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3140}$"
" locker sizes are a fascinating area of study in geometry and spatial reasoning. When analyzing the relationships between locker sizes, we can apply basic algebraic principles to derive the solution.

Let's denote the size of Timothy's locker as T, Zack's locker as Z, and Peter's locker as P. We are given that P = 5 cubic inches. Additionally, we know that P = 1/4Z and Z = 2T.

We can start by expressing Z in terms of P: Z = 4P = 4(5) = 20 cubic inches.

Next, we can express T in terms of Z: T = Z/2 = 20/2 = 10 cubic inches.

Therefore, Timothy's locker size is 10 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the distance Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we can calculate the difference in elevation between the two points.

Let's denote Stanley's comb as point A (10,000 feet) and Oliver's current location as point B (3,000 feet). The distance between these two points can be found by subtracting the elevation of point B from the elevation of point A.

Distance = Elevation of point A - Elevation of point B
= 10,000 - 3,000
= 7,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7,000}$"
"To determine the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we can use basic arithmetic operations. 

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital.
2. The first bank gave him $4000.
3. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

Now, we add the initial capital to the total amount received from the two banks:

$5000 + $4000 = $9000
$9000 + $8000 = $17000

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

First, we need to find the number of cats that were carried away by the boats. Since 4 boats carried away 5 cats each, we can calculate this as 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

Next, we need to find 3/5 of the remaining cats. To do this, we'll multiply the remaining cats (50 - 20 = 30) by 3/5. This can be calculated as (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse (18) from the remaining cats (30) to find the final number of cats left on the rock: 30 - 18 = 12.

Therefore, the final number of cats left on the rock is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we can break it down into three distinct periods based on the pricing structure.

The first 6 months are charged at $8 per month, resulting in a total of 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months are charged at the normal rate of $12 per month, resulting in a total of 8 * $12 = $96.

The final 8 months are charged at the increased rate of $14 per month, resulting in a total of 8 * $14 = $112.

To find the total cost of 2 years, we add the costs of these three periods: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256.

Therefore, the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service is $256."
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables and setting up the equation. Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

We know that Cole saved a total of $6, and 1/3 of it came from the jogger jeans. This means 2/3 of the total savings came from the tattered jeans. We can set up the equation:

(2/3)(x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

2(x + 6) = 18

Next, we can distribute the 2 to the terms inside the parentheses:

2x + 12 = 18

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2x = 6

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 3

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $3, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

Original price of tattered jeans = x + 6
= 3 + 6
= 9

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:

Original price of tattered jeans - Original price of jogger jeans
= 9 - 3
= 6

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the total capacity of the vehicles, we can calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

The capacity of the buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to a store-bought feeder as B and the number of birds attracted to a homemade feeder as H. We are given that B = 20 and H = B + 10.

Since Lillian buys 3 store-bought feeders and builds 3 homemade feeders, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3B, and the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3H.

We can substitute the value of H in terms of B: 3H = 3(B + 10) = 3B + 30.

Now, we can add the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders: 3B + (3B + 30) = 6B + 30.

We are given that B = 20, so we can substitute this value into the equation: 6(20) + 30 = 120 + 30 = 150.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

Final answer: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we can break down the problem into individual components and calculate each item's cost.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the soup, which is 25% more than the bagel. This can be expressed as:

Cost of soup = Cost of bagel + (25% of Cost of bagel)
= $4 + (0.25 × $4)
= $4 + $1
= $5

Next, we calculate the cost of the cake, which is half the price of the bagel:

Cost of cake = (1/2) × Cost of bagel
= (1/2) × $4
= $2

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the costs of all items:

Total cost = Cost of bagel + Cost of soup + Cost of cake
= $4 + $5 + $2
= $11

Therefore, Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To determine the initial number of cards Kenny had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the total number of cards as x. Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of them. The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is $50, and each card is sold for $1.5.

The equation can be set up as follows:

(2/3)x * $1.5 = $50

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying the fractions and the decimal:

(2/3) * $1.5 = $1

Now, we have:

$1x = $50

To isolate x, we can divide both sides by $1:

x = $50 / $1

x = 50

Therefore, Kenny started with 50 cards."
"To determine the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog, we can employ a simple subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of hotdogs required for 40 guests to have two hotdogs each. This can be calculated as:

40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs

Since the caterer initially prepared 36 hotdogs, we can determine the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog by subtracting the initial number of hotdogs from the total required:

80 hotdogs - 36 hotdogs = 44 hotdogs

However, this represents the excess hotdogs available. To find the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog, we need to consider the initial number of guests prepared for two hotdogs. Since half of the guests were prepared for two hotdogs, we can calculate this as:

36 guests / 2 = 18 guests

Now, we can subtract the number of guests prepared for two hotdogs from the total number of guests to find the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog:

40 guests - 18 guests = 22 guests

Therefore, 22 guests did not receive a second hotdog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we can break down the problem into two parts. 

First, we find the number of letters in Indras' name, which is given as 6. 

Next, we calculate the number of letters in her sister's name. Since her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, we can express this as:

Number of letters in sister's name = (1/2) * Number of letters in Indras' name + 4
= (1/2) * 6 + 4
= 3 + 4
= 7

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7) to find the total:

Total number of letters = 6 + 7
= 13

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order, we can apply the concept of percentage discount. The formula for finding the discount amount is:

Discount = (Discount Percentage / 100) * Total Cost

In this case, the discount percentage is 20% and the total cost is $165.00.

Discount = (20 / 100) * $165.00
= 0.20 * $165.00
= $33.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount:

Final Amount = Total Cost - Discount
= $165.00 - $33.00
= $132.00

Therefore, the final amount Charlotte needs to pay is $132.00."
"To determine the amount of money Dora needs to purchase the skipping rope, board game, and playground ball, we must first calculate the total cost of the items. 

The total cost is the sum of the individual costs: 
$6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has a total of $18, which is the sum of her allowance ($2) and the $16 given by her mother.

To find the amount of money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost:
$19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"To determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we can analyze the given information step by step.

First, we know that Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Then, Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. This can be expressed as:

Number of dragons Prince Arthur slew = (3/4) * 100
= 75

Next, Prince Walter, using a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. This can be expressed as:

Number of dragons Prince Walter slew = 2 * 75
= 150

Finally, Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter using a nail file. This can be expressed as:

Number of dragons Prince Bruce slew = (1/5) * 150
= 30

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the amount of gasoline Josey needed, we can calculate 1/4 of the total amount of gasoline in gallons.

Let's denote the total amount of gasoline as G. Since it was equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds G/5 gallons. 

Josey needed 1/4 of this amount, so we can set up the equation:

(1/4) * (G/5) = x

To solve for x, we can multiply the fractions:

x = (1/4) * (G/5)
x = (1/20) * G

Since we know G = 15 gallons, we can substitute this value into the equation:

x = (1/20) * 15
x = 15/20
x = 0.75 gallons

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

x = 0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon
x = 6 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"To determine the number of candy bars George purchased, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we calculate the total amount spent on chips: 3 bags × $0.40 per bag = $1.20. 

Since George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of his money, which is $4.90. 

Now, we subtract the cost of chips from the total amount spent to find the amount spent on candy bars: $4.90 - $1.20 = $3.70.

Given that each candy bar costs $0.75, we can calculate the number of candy bars purchased by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar: $3.70 ÷ $0.75 = 4.93 (round down to 4, as we cannot purchase a fraction of a candy bar).

Therefore, George bought 4 candy bars.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the number of lollipops each friend received, we can employ the concept of division. Given that Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, the remaining lollipops are 20. Since these 20 lollipops are being shared equally among 4 friends, we can express this as a division problem:

Number of lollipops per friend = Total remaining lollipops ÷ Number of friends
= 20 ÷ 4
= 5

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we can apply the concept of division to find the weight of each piece and then subtract the total weight of the pieces from the original weight of the cake.

Given that the cake is cut into 8 equal pieces, we can calculate the weight of each piece as follows:

Weight of each piece = Total weight of the cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, the total weight of the pieces they had is:

Total weight of the pieces = 2 pieces * Weight of each piece
Total weight of the pieces = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight of the pieces = 5 ounces

Now, we can subtract the total weight of the pieces from the original weight of the cake to find the weight of the remaining cake:

Weight of the remaining cake = Total weight of the cake - Total weight of the pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of the remaining cake = 15 ounces

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of oranges each person will receive, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people. 

First, we calculate the total number of oranges: 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges.

Next, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends): 56 ÷ 8 = 7.

Therefore, each person will receive 7 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To calculate the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we must first determine the total cost of the ingredients. The cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound, and the cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box.

Total cost of onions: 4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00
Total cost of beef stock: 2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00
Total cost of ingredients: $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, we can calculate the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings.

Cost per serving = Total cost / Number of servings
= $12.00 / 6
= $2.00

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2."
"To determine the optimal departure time for Bernadette, we must consider the time it takes for her to reach the theater. Given that the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to reach the theater, we can calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to reach the theater.

Let's denote the time it takes for Wayne to reach the theater as W. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long, we can express this as 4W. We know that W = 4 minutes. Therefore, the time it takes for Bernadette to reach the theater is 4W = 4(4) = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

The correct answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To find the perimeter of the room, we must first convert the length from yards to feet, as the standard unit of measurement for the perimeter is feet. Given that 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Next, we can utilize the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width. We are provided with the area, which is 360 square feet, and the length, which we've determined to be 9 feet. By substituting these values into the formula, we can solve for the width:

360 = 9 * Width

Dividing both sides by 9, we obtain:

Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can calculate the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

Final answer: 98"
"To determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we can calculate the total number of beads each one has.

Elizabeth's total beads = (1 pack of red beads) + (2 packs of clear beads) = 20 + (2 * 20) = 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth's total beads = (3 packs of blue beads) + (4 packs of red beads) = 3 * 20 + 4 * 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

The difference in the number of beads between the two sisters can be found by subtracting Elizabeth's total beads from Margareth's total beads: 140 - 60 = 80 beads.

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we can break down the problem into two distinct components: the temperature change due to baking and the cooling effect.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to baking. The oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and it is on for 3 hours. We can represent this as:

ΔT_baking = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees

Next, we need to account for the cooling effect. The house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, we can calculate the cooling effect as:

ΔT_cooling = -2 degrees/10 minutes * 30 minutes = -6 degrees

Now, we can find the final temperature by adding the temperature change due to baking and subtracting the cooling effect:

T_final = T_initial + ΔT_baking + ΔT_cooling
= 40 degrees + 15 degrees - 6 degrees
= 49 degrees

Therefore, the final temperature of Marcus's house is 49 degrees.

The final answer is 49."
"To determine James' time for the run, we can start by calculating the time difference between Jon's and James' swim times. 

First, we find 10% of Jon's swim time: 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. Subtracting this from Jon's swim time, we get James' swim time: 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Next, we calculate James' bike time by adding 5 minutes to Jon's bike time: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Jon's total time = James' total time + 10 minutes

Let's denote James' run time as x. We know Jon's run time is 50 minutes. So, the equation becomes:

40 + 80 + 50 = 36 + x + 85 + x

Combine like terms:

170 = 121 + 2x

Subtract 121 from both sides:

49 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 24.5

The final answer is 24.5."
"To determine the length of Movie A, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the three movies. 

First, we know that Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equivalent to 75 minutes. Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, we can express the length of Movie B as 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Now, we are told that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we can divide the length of Movie B by 4.

Let's calculate the length of Movie A:

Length of Movie A = Length of Movie B / 4
= 80 minutes / 4
= 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total cost of the hay, we must first calculate the total amount of hay consumed. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, and the horse runs 16 miles, the total amount of hay consumed is:

8 bails

The cost of the hay is:
8 bails * $3 per bail = $24

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30

Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we must first calculate the total number of eggs she has. 

We know that 4 dozen eggs is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, we get a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Since each glass requires 5 eggs, we can calculate the number of glasses by dividing the total number of eggs by 5:
50 ÷ 5 = 10 glasses

As each tray holds 5 glasses, we can find the number of trays by dividing the total number of glasses by 5:
10 ÷ 5 = 2 trays

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog."
"To determine the current lead of Joey in the Scrabble game, we must calculate the net change in points.

Initially, Joey had 214 points. He scored 26 points, increasing his score to 214 + 26 = 240 points.

Meanwhile, Marcy, who had 225 points, scored 10 points, bringing her total to 225 + 10 = 235 points.

The difference between their scores represents the current lead of Joey. To find this, we subtract Marcy's new score from Joey's new score:

240 - 235 = 5

Therefore, Joey is currently leading by 5 points.

Final answer: 5"
"To calculate the salesman's profit, we can break down the problem into two parts: the revenue generated from the flash sale and the revenue generated from selling the remaining sneakers to the department store.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale:

Revenue from flash sale = Number of sneakers sold at $20 * Price per sneaker
= 17 * $20
= $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers to the department store:

Number of sneakers left = Total sneakers - Sneakers sold at $20
= 48 - 17
= 31

Revenue from selling 31 sneakers at $25 = 31 * $25
= $775

Total revenue = Revenue from flash sale + Revenue from selling to department store
= $340 + $775
= $1115

Now, let's calculate the profit:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $1115 - $576
= $539

Therefore, the salesman's profit is $539."
"To determine the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we can employ the concept of weighted averages. We have two types of packets: those with 8 colors and those with 16 colors. 

Let's denote the number of packets with 8 colors as 'x' and the number of packets with 16 colors as 'y'. We are given that x = 6 and y = 4. 

The total number of colors can be represented as 8x + 16y. Substituting the given values, we get 8(6) + 16(4) = 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

"To determine the regular price of the popcorn, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as x.

The cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $12, and the cost of the popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $18. Since the super ticket includes one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra, the cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $18 - $1 = $17.

We know that the cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $12, so we can set up the equation:

12 = 17 - x + 3

Simplifying the equation, we get:

12 = 20 - x

Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us:

-8 = -x

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

x = 8

Therefore, the regular price of the popcorn is $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we can utilize the concept of unitary method. 

First, we calculate the new cost per balloon by adding the $20 increase to the original cost per balloon. The original cost per balloon was $900 / 20 = $45. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Next, we multiply the new cost per balloon by the total number of balloons to find the total cost: $65 * 170 = $11,050.

The final answer is $11,050."
"To calculate the average speed of the car, we can utilize the formula for average speed, which is total distance divided by total time. In this scenario, the car travels at two different speeds for two different durations.

First, we calculate the distance traveled at each speed. The car travels 60 mph for 2 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then, it travels 30 mph for 1 hour, covering a distance of 30 * 1 = 30 miles. The total distance traveled is the sum of these two distances: 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

Next, we calculate the total time taken, which is the sum of the individual times: 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

The final answer is 50."

"To determine the total cost of potting soil, we must first calculate the volume of soil required for the 10 raised beds. The volume of one bed is given by the product of its dimensions: length x width x height = 8 ft x 2 ft x 2 ft = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 cubic feet/bed x 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags required is 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

The cost of each bag is $12, so the total cost will be 160 bags x $12/bag = $1920.

Therefore, the total cost of potting soil for Bob's vegetable garden is $1920."
"To determine the total number of cards, we can break down the problem into three components: red cards, green cards, and yellow cards.

First, we calculate the number of green cards by finding 60% of the number of red cards and adding it to the number of red cards.

Number of green cards = 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards.

Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
= 39

Finally, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards.

Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39

"To determine the percentage of puppies with spots, we can use the formula for percentage, which is (part/whole) * 100. In this case, the part is the number of puppies with spots (7), and the whole is the total number of puppies (20).

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, the percentage of puppies with spots is 35%."
"To determine the number of trips required to transport the feed, we must first calculate the total weight of the feed. This can be achieved by summing the weights of each item:

Total weight = (2 boxes of sugar cubes) + (4 bags of carrots) + (42 bales of hay) + (20 sacks of oats)
Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300
Total weight = 4400 pounds

Now, we can divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips:

Number of trips = Total weight / Capacity of the truck
= 4400 / 2250
= 1.96

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, we must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all the feed is transported. Therefore, the farmer will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate Grayson's monthly earnings from recycling, we need to first determine her weekly earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles. 

Let's break it down:

Aluminum cans: 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week
Plastic bottles: 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total weekly earnings = 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the weekly earnings by 4 to find the total monthly earnings:

Total monthly earnings = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month

Therefore, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.

The final answer is 84."
"To determine the number of plants Shondra has, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of plants Frederick has as F, Toni has as T, and Shondra has as S.

Given that Frederick has 10 plants, we can express this as:

F = 10

We are also given that Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. This can be represented as:

T = F + 0.6F
T = 1.6F

Substituting the value of F, we get:

T = 1.6 * 10
T = 16

Now, we are told that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Therefore, we can express this as:

S = T - 7
S = 16 - 7
S = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine Ali's current amount of money, we need to calculate the amount Leila gave him. Since Leila gave him half of her $100, we can calculate this as follows:

Leila's half of her money = $100 / 2 = $50

"To determine Finley's final position in the 100-meter race, we can analyze her movements step by step.

Initially, Finley started in 1st place. She then experienced a series of changes in her position, which can be represented as follows:

-5 (initial position) + 2 = -3
-3 + 1 = -2

Since Finley's position is now -2, we need to add 1 to account for the fact that positions are typically non-negative. Therefore, we can represent Finley's final position as:

1 + (-2 + 1) = 0

However, in a race, a position of 0 is not a valid outcome. We can assume that the problem intends to ask for the position in the context of the race, where the first position is 1st, the second position is 2nd, and so on. In this case, we can represent Finley's final position as:

1 + (-2 + 1) = 0

Since 0 is not a valid position, we can add 1 to account for the fact that positions are typically non-negative. Therefore, Finley's final position is:

1

The correct answer is A."
"To determine the number of students Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she has and then divide that by the number of cards each student received.

Miss Maria has 6 decks of basketball cards, each containing 25 cards, and 5 boxes of baseball cards, each containing 40 cards. We can calculate the total number of cards as follows:

Total basketball cards = 6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 cards
Total baseball cards = 5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 cards

The total number of cards is the sum of basketball and baseball cards:
Total cards = 150 + 200 = 350 cards

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

To find the number of students, we divide the remaining cards by 10 (the number of cards each student received):
Number of students = 300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the difference in the amount paid by Becky and Kelly, we can calculate the total cost of each purchase and then find the difference.

Becky's total cost = Number of apples × Price per apple - Discount
Becky's total cost = 20 × $0.45 - $1
Becky's total cost = $9 - $1
Becky's total cost = $8

Kelly's total cost = Number of apples × Price per apple - Discount
Kelly's total cost = 20 × $0.50 - (10% of $10)
Kelly's total cost = $10 - $1
Kelly's total cost = $9

The difference in the amount paid by Becky and Kelly = Kelly's total cost - Becky's total cost
The difference in the amount paid = $9 - $8
The difference in the amount paid = $1

Given that each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, the total number of cupcakes needed is:

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

To find out how many pans are required, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the capacity of each pan, which is 12 cupcakes.

48 cupcakes ÷ 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles."
"To determine the amount of change Theo received, we must first calculate the total cost of the items purchased. The cost of the pen is $2, and the cost of the paper is $1 less than three times the price of the pen. This can be expressed as:

Cost of paper = 3 * Cost of pen - $1
= 3 * $2 - $1
= $6 - $1
= $5

Total cost = Cost of pen + Cost of paper
= $2 + $5
= $7

Since Theo gave the cashier $10, the change she received can be calculated as:

Change = Amount given - Total cost
= $10 - $7
= $3

Therefore, the amount of change Theo received is $3."
"To determine the number of pencils left, we can break down the problem into manageable steps. 

First, we calculate the total number of pencils initially: 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

Next, we find the number of pencils used in 2 months: 1/5 of 300 pencils = (1/5) * 300 = 60 pencils.

Now, we subtract the pencils used from the initial total to find the remaining pencils: 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

Finally, we calculate 1/3 of the remaining pencils to find the pencils left at the end of the year: (1/3) * 240 = 80 pencils.

Therefore, the number of pencils left is 80."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as x. According to the given conditions, the number of cookies he gets is half the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be represented as:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To isolate x, we'll first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To calculate the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras, we can use the following formula:

Percentage = (Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100

Given that the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot and the length of the shark is 10 feet, we can plug in the values as follows:

Percentage = (1 / 10) * 100

To simplify the fraction, we can divide 1 by 10, which equals 0.1. Then, we multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:

Percentage = 0.1 * 100 = 10%

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras occupies 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10\%}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the total number of students as x.

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x. We are also given that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, so the number of students without a desktop computer is x - (3/4)x = (1/4)x.

We can equate (1/4)x to 20 and solve for x:

(1/4)x = 20

To isolate x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80."
"To determine the daily walking time required to break in a new pair of shoes, we can utilize the concept of division. Given that Jason wants to break in the shoes in 3 weeks, we first need to convert the time period to days. Since there are 7 days in a week, 3 weeks is equivalent to 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Now, we can divide the total walking time (240 minutes) by the number of days (21) to find the daily walking time.

Daily walking time = Total walking time / Number of days
= 240 minutes / 21 days
= 11.42857143 minutes per day

To express this in a more precise format, we can use the following calculation:

Daily walking time = 240 minutes / 21 days
= 11.42857143 minutes/day

This can be further simplified to 11.43 minutes per day, which is the approximate daily walking time required to break in the new shoes.

Total Cost = $300
Book Price = $15

Total Books = Total Cost ÷ Book Price
Total Books = $300 ÷ $15
Total Books = 20

Since Sarah distributed the books equally among her 4 children, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find the number of books each child received:

Number of Books per Child = Total Books ÷ 4
Number of Books per Child = 20 ÷ 4
Number of Books per Child = 5

Therefore, each child received 5 books."
"To determine the number of kids in Gina's class who aren't allergic to anything, we can employ the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

Let's denote the total number of kids as N, the number of kids allergic to dairy as D, the number of kids allergic to peanuts as P, and the number of kids allergic to both as B. We're given N = 32, D = 9, and P = 6, with B = 3.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of kids allergic to at least one substance is given by:

D + P - B = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

To find the number of kids not allergic to anything, we subtract this value from the total number of kids:

N - (D + P - B) = 32 - 12 = 20

Therefore, 20 kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we can utilize the fundamental principle of multiplication. Given that there are 3 groups of 200 employees each, we can calculate the total number of employees by multiplying the number of groups by the number of employees in each group.

Let's apply the multiplication operation:

3 (number of groups) × 200 (number of employees per group) = 600

Since the tour guides are not part of the employee count, we do not need to include them in our calculation. Therefore, the total number of people going on the tour is 600.

The final answer is: 600"
"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we can break down the expenses into two components: the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 per person, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we can calculate 20% of $1500 as 0.20 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400"
"To determine the total number of paint tubes Jasper has, we can apply basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the number of blue paint tubes Ben has as B and the number of yellow paint tubes Ben has as Y. We are given that B = 4 and Y = 3.

Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, the number of blue paint tubes Jasper has can be calculated as B/2. Substituting the value of B, we get 4/2 = 2.

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so the number of yellow paint tubes Jasper has can be calculated as 3Y. Substituting the value of Y, we get 3 * 3 = 9.

To find the total number of paint tubes Jasper has, we add the number of blue and yellow paint tubes: 2 + 9 = 11.

"To determine the combined weight of the two pennies, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Given that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can express this relationship as a ratio:

Weight of 2010 penny = 3/4 * Weight of 1959 penny

We are provided with the weight of the 1959 penny, which is 48 grains. Substituting this value into the equation, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny:

Weight of 2010 penny = 3/4 * 48
= 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
= 48 + 36
= 84 grains

Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"To determine the remaining amount needed to reach their goal, we can calculate the total earnings of Keegan and Tashay and then subtract that from their target amount.

Let's calculate their combined earnings: $83 (Keegan's earnings) + $91 (Tashay's earnings) = $174.

Now, we'll subtract this amount from their goal: $200 (goal) - $174 (combined earnings) = $26.

"To calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we can use the concept of proportional reasoning. Since Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges, we can set up a proportion to find the amount he gave up.

Let's denote the total amount of money Stetson gave up as x. We know that he gave up $10 for each orange, and he ate 2/5 of 60 oranges. So, we can set up the proportion:

(2/5) / 60 = x / 10

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

(2/5) * 10 = x * 60
(2/5) * (10/1) = x * (60/1)
(2 * 10) / 5 = x * 60
20 / 5 = x * 60
4 = x * 60

Now, divide both sides by 60 to isolate x:

x = 4 / 60
x = 1/15 * 60
x = 4

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $4.

Final answer: $4"

"To calculate the total hours James runs per week, we can employ the fundamental principles of unit conversion and multiplication.

Given:
- Miles per day: 12 miles
- Days per week: 5 days
- Miles per hour: 10 miles

First, we'll convert the total miles per week to hours by dividing the total miles per week by the miles per hour.

Total hours per week = Total miles per week / Miles per hour
= (12 miles/day * 5 days) / 10 miles/hour
= 60 miles / 10 miles/hour
= 6 hours/week

Therefore, James runs 6 hours per week."
"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs for his horses, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day: 4 horses * 10 pounds/horse = 40 pounds/day.

Next, we multiply this daily consumption by the number of days: 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Since each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we can find the number of bags needed by dividing the total amount of oats required by the weight per bag: 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats for his horses for five days.

Final answer: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of girl Pomeranians, we can apply the concept of proportions. Since two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and one-third of those Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate the number of girl Pomeranians as follows:

Let's denote the total number of puppies as P and the number of Pomeranians as P'. We know that P' = (2/3)P. Since one-third of the Pomeranians are girls, the number of girl Pomeranians can be represented as (1/3)P'.

Substituting P' = (2/3)P into the expression for the number of girl Pomeranians, we get:

Number of girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * (2/3)P
= (1/3) * (2/3) * P
= (2/9)P

Given that P = 27, we can substitute this value into the expression:

Number of girl Pomeranians = (2/9) * 27
= (2/9) * 27

"To determine the cost of each individual razor, we must first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors, taking into account the buy one get one free promotion.

The cost of 2 packs of razors without the coupon would be 2 * $4.00 = $8.00. However, since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack, which is $4.00.

Applying the $2.00 coupon to the cost of 1 pack, we get $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Now, we need to find the cost of each individual razor. Since there are 4 razors in a pack, we divide the total cost by 4: $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the total height of the human pyramid, we can break it down into individual layers and sum their heights.

The bottom layer consists of 4 girls with an average height of 64 inches. We can calculate the total height of this layer as 4 * 64 = 256 inches.

The next layer has 3 girls standing on top of the 4, with an average height of 64 inches. The total height of this layer is 3 * 64 = 192 inches.

The next layer has 2 girls standing on top of the 3, with an average height of 64 inches. The total height of this layer is 2 * 64 = 128 inches.

The shortest girl, who is 60 inches tall, is at the top of the pyramid.

Now, let's add up the heights of all the layers: 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 576 inches.

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 576 / 12 = 48 feet.

Therefore, the total height of the human pyramid is 48 feet."
"To determine the total number of minutes Charisma walked in 5 days, we can utilize the concept of multiplication. Since she walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours a day, we can calculate the total minutes walked per day as 8 hours/day * 5 minutes/hour = 40 minutes/day.

Multiplying this result by the number of days (5) yields a total of 40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

Therefore, Charisma walked a total of 200 minutes in 5 days."

"To calculate the total cost of Paul's daily driving expenses, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic sequences. 

Let's denote the number of morning rides as 'm' and the number of afternoon rides as 'a'. We are given that Paul drives twice a day, so m = a = 2. The cost of each morning ride is $6, and the cost of each afternoon ride is $2. 

The total cost can be represented as: Total Cost = (6 * m) + (2 * a)

Substituting the values of m and a, we get: Total Cost = (6 * 2) + (2 * 2) = 12 + 4 = $16

However, this calculation only accounts for a single day's expenses. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, we need to multiply the daily cost by 2 and then by 14:

Total Cost = 2 * (6 + 2) * 14
= 2 * 8 * 14
= 224

Therefore, Paul spent a total of $224 on driving his car during these two weeks.

The final answer is: $224"
"To determine the total number of greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to calculate the combined total of oranges they brought and then divide that by the number of oranges required per pie.

Let's break it down:

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she brought a total of 5 x 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, which is 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The combined total of oranges is 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one greek orange pie requires 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

Therefore, Brianne and Ashley can make 40 greek orange pies."
"To determine the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let x be the number of guests. The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost), while the cost of the second venue is $25x (per guest charge). Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides yields:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20:

10 = x

Therefore, the number of guests required for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of insects each person found. Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as x, the number David found as y, and the number Lily found as z.

We are given that Lily found 7 more insects than David, so we can express this as:

z = y + 7

We are also given that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can express this as:

y = x/2

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

x + y + z = 43

Substituting the expressions for y and z in terms of x, we get:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

y = x/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

z = y + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total yards of yarn used, we can add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma. 

First, we need to convert the fractions into equivalent decimals to facilitate the calculation. 

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, which is equivalent to 0.25. Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is equivalent to 0.5.

Total yards used = 0.25 + 0.5 = 0.75

Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, we can multiply the total yards used by 364 to find the total yards used in the skein.

Total yards used = 0.75 * 364 = 273

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used a total of 273 yards of yarn.

Given that the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, we can calculate the width of the rug as 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch's length is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:

Length of couch = 2 × Width of rug + 2
= 2 × 8 + 2
= 16 + 2
= 18 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. Since Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, the total cost of these packs is 2x.

We know that she spent $2 on a pack of grape gum and $1 on a pack of green apple gum. The total amount she spent on these two packs is $2 + $1 = $3. Therefore, the amount she spent on strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

Since the total cost of strawberry gum is 2x, we can set up the equation 2x = 4 to represent this relationship. Solving for x, we get x = 4 / 2 = 2.

Thus, the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the most cost-effective option for Frederick, we can calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber.

The cost per stick for 2 x 4 lumber is $4/200 = $0.02 per stick.

The cost per stick for 2 x 8 lumber is $6/400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since $0.015 per stick is less than $0.02 per stick, Frederick should prioritize purchasing the 2 x 8 lumber to minimize his costs.

With $24, Frederick can afford to buy 4 units of 2 x 8 lumber. Each unit yields 400 sticks, so the total number of sticks he can make is 4 x 400 = 1600.

Therefore, the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600."
"To calculate the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's 6 sled dogs, we can apply the fundamental principle of multiplication. Since each dog requires a pair of snowshoes, and the cost of each pair is $12.00, we can multiply the number of dogs by the cost per pair to determine the total cost.

Let's perform the calculation:

Total Cost = Number of Dogs * Cost per Pair

"To determine the amount Janet would save by purchasing a weekly bus pass, we can calculate the difference between the total cost of her bus trips and the cost of the pass.

Let's break down the calculation:

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20, and Janet takes two trips per day, 5 days a week. To find the total cost of her bus trips per week, we multiply the cost per trip by the number of trips per day and then by the number of days per week:

Total cost of bus trips per week = (2 trips/day) × ($2.20/trip) × (5 days/week) = $22

Now, we can find the amount Janet would save by subtracting the cost of the weekly pass from the total cost of her bus trips:

Amount saved = Total cost of bus trips per week - Cost of weekly pass
= $22 - $20
= $2

Therefore, Janet would save $2 by purchasing a weekly bus pass.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of cows on the farm as F and the number of sheep on the farm as S, and the number of cows on the zoo as Z, and the number of sheep on the zoo as W.

We are given the following information:
1. F = 30 (number of cows on the farm)
2. Z = 2F (the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm)
3. S = F/2 (the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo)
4. W = 2S (the zoo has twice as many sheep as the farm)

We can substitute the given values into the equations to find the number of sheep on the farm and the zoo.

First, we find the number of sheep on the farm: S = F/2 = 30/2 = 15.

Next, we find the number of sheep on the zoo: W = 2S = 2(15) = 30.

Now, we can find the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo by adding the number of cows and sheep from both places: Total animals = F + Z + S + W = 30 + 60 + 15 + 30 = 135.

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"

$400 - $100 = $300

Therefore, Julie had $300 left.

300"
"To determine the cost of the house, we can utilize the concept of ratios. Given that the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can express this relationship as a ratio:

House cost : Lot cost = 3 : 1

Let's represent the cost of the lot as x. Then, the cost of the house is 3x. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot (x), we can find the cost of the house by multiplying x by 3:

"To determine the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

Let's denote the number of quarts Tony can pick per hour as T, Bobby as B, Kathy as K, and Ricky as R. We are given the following information:

T = 6
B = T - 1
K = 2B
R = K - 2

We can substitute the expressions for B and K in terms of T into the equation for R:

R = 2(T - 1) - 2
R = 2T - 2 - 2
R = 2T - 4

Now, we can express the total number of quarts that can be picked per hour as the sum of the individual amounts:

Total = T + B + K + R
Total = T + (T - 1) + 2(T - 1) + (2T - 4)
Total = T + T - 1 + 2T - 2 + 2T - 4
Total = 6T - 7

Substituting T = 6 into the equation, we get:

"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we must first calculate her original and new weekly consumption.

The original daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour, and the new daily consumption is 14 kilowatts per hour. To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7.

Original weekly consumption = 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours
New weekly consumption = 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour. To find the original and new weekly bills, we multiply the weekly consumption by the cost per kilowatt-hour.

Original weekly bill = 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126
New weekly bill = 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

"To determine the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house, we can utilize the concept of inverse proportionality between the number of people and the time required to complete the task.

Let's denote the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house as 't' hours. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can set up the following equation:

1/2 * t = 5 days

To solve for 't', we can multiply both sides by 2:

t = 10 days

Now, we need to convert the time from days to hours:

t = 10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

Since 5 people can paint a whole house in the same amount of time it takes one person to paint a whole house, we can set up the following equation:

5 * (240 hours) = 1200 hours

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house. Since 5 people can paint a whole house in the same amount of time it takes one person to paint half a house, we can set up the following equation:

5 * (5 days) = 25 days

Now, we can convert the time from days to hours:

25 days * 24 hours/day = 600 hours

Therefore, it will take 5 people 600 hours to paint a whole house.

Final answer: 600"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas can be represented as 'x - 2'. We are given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 20

Solving for 'x', we get:

x = 22

This means Ophelia has 22 chairs. Given that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Now, to find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna:

Total = (Ophelia's sofas) + (Ophelia's chairs) + (Jenna's chairs)
Total = 20 + 22 + 66
Total = 108

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is 108."

Let's denote the cost of the CD as C and the cost of the headphone set as H. We are given that the total amount paid is $48, so we can set up the equation:

C + H = 48

We know the cost of the CD, C, is $4. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

4 + H = 48

To isolate H, we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

H = 48 - 4
H = 44

Now, we can find the number of additional CDs Tom could have bought by dividing the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD:

Number of additional CDs = H / C
= 44 / 4
= 11

Therefore, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had not purchased the headphone set.

The final answer is 11."
"To calculate the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks, we can break down the problem into parts. 

First, we need to find the total hours for the weeks he worked 4 hours. Since there are 5 weeks with 4 hours, we can calculate this as 4 hours/week * 5 weeks = 20 hours. 

Next, we add the hours from the week he worked 5 hours, which is 5 hours. Lastly, we add the hours from the week he worked 6 hours, which is 6 hours.

Total hours = 20 hours + 5 hours + 6 hours = 31 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To determine the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, resulting in 48 - 8 = 40 passengers remaining.

The number of passengers who get on the bus at the first stop is 5 times the number who got off, which is 5 * 8 = 40. Therefore, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which is 3 times the number who got off (21), so 3 * 21 = 63. Thus, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 + 63 = 122.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote James' current age as J and his cousin's current age as C.

We know that James will turn 27 in 5 years, so we can write an equation for his current age:

J + 5 = 27

Solving for J, we get:

J = 22

We also know that in 8 years, James' cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James' age. We can write an equation for this:

C + 8 = 2(J + 8) - 5

Substituting J = 22 into the equation, we get:

C + 8 = 2(22 + 8) - 5
C + 8 = 2(30) - 5
C + 8 = 55
C = 47

Now that we have the current ages of James and his cousin, we can find the age difference:

Age difference = C - J
= 47 - 22
= 25

Therefore, the age difference between James and his cousin is 25 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the cost of one monitor, we can utilize the given information to set up an equation. Let's denote the cost of one monitor as x.

We know that the total cost of all three items is $2,400, and the cost of the computer is $1,100. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, the cost of the printer is $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. Therefore, the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we can divide the total cost of the monitors by 2:

x = $600 / 2
x = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of seashells brought by each girl, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of seashells brought by each girl as 'g'. Since the boys brought 60 shells each, and there are 10 boys, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be expressed as:

Total shells brought by girls = 600 + 4 * 60
Total shells brought by girls = 600 + 240
Total shells brought by girls = 840

Since there are 10 girls, we can find the number of seashells brought by each girl by dividing the total number of seashells brought by the girls by 10:

g = 840 / 10
g = 84

Therefore, each girl brought 84 seashells.

The final answer is 84."
"To solve this problem, we can utilize the concept of ratios and proportions. Let's denote the number of candies Nick had initially as N and the number of candies George had initially as G. We are given that Nick had twice as many candies as George, so we can express this relationship as:

N = 2G

We are also given that George ate 5 candies, resulting in him having 3 candies left. This can be represented as:

G - 5 = 3

Solving for G, we get:

G = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick had by substituting G into the equation N = 2G:

N = 2(8)
N = 16

Therefore, Nick had 16 candies initially.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine Anne's age, we can apply the given information using basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote Chenny's age as C, Alyana's age as A, and Anne's age as N. We are provided with the following information:

1. C = 10 (Chenny is 10 years old)
2. A = C - 4 (Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny)
3. N = A + 2 (Anne is 2 years older than Alyana)

We can substitute the value of C into the equation for A:
A = 10 - 4
A = 6

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation for N:
N = 6 + 2
N = 8

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old.

Final answer: 8"
"To determine the total thickness of the four books, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To determine the number of vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we can utilize the concept of subtraction. 

Let's calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made: 18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week) = 54 vlogs.

To find the number of vlogs she still needs to make, we subtract the total vlogs made from the target: 72 (target) - 54 (total made) = 18 vlogs.

Therefore, Emma needs to create 18 more vlogs to meet her monthly goal of 72 vlogs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To calculate the total amount paid, we need to determine the 20% tip on the $50 bill. 

The tip can be calculated using the formula: Tip = (Bill Amount) * (Tip Percentage)
Tip = $50 * 0.20
Tip = $10

Now, add the tip to the original bill: 
Total Amount = Bill Amount + Tip
Total Amount = $50 + $10
Total Amount = $60

Therefore, the total amount paid is $60."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

Let's denote the initial amount each boy received as x. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we can set up the equation:

3x = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 18/3
x = 6

So, each boy initially received $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making his total $6 + $5 = $11.

The next day, he adds another $10 to his total, making it $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

Let's denote the amount he saves as y. We know that after saving, he triples the amount he had left after spending $8, which is 3 times $13. So, we can set up the equation:

$13 + y = 3 * $13

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$13 + y = $39

Subtracting $13 from both sides, we get:

y = $26

Now, we know that the eldest boy initially had $6, added $5, then $10, and then spent $8. So, his total before saving was $6 + $5 + $10 - $8 = $13.

After saving $26, his new total is $13 + $26 = $39.

Therefore, the eldest boy now has $39."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount Elvis saves in the first half of the month as x. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, the amount saved in the second half is 2x.

We know that the total savings for the month is $1125, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 1125

Combining like terms, we get:

3x = 1125

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

x = 375

This represents the amount Elvis saves in the first half of the month. To determine the amount saved in the second half, we multiply x by 2:

2x = 2 * 375 = 750

Since there are 15 days in the second half of the month, we can calculate the daily savings by dividing the total savings for the second half by 15:

750 ÷ 15 = 50

Therefore, Elvis must save $50 per day in the second half of the month.

Final answer: $50"
"To calculate the total cost of the fruit, we can apply the principle of arithmetic addition. 

The cost of apples: 3 * $1.50 = $4.50
The cost of oranges: 5 * $0.80 = $4.00
The cost of peaches: 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

To determine the change Verna received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave: $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To calculate the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny, we can use the concept of linear equations. Let's denote Jairus's earnings as J and Jenny's earnings as Y. We know that Jairus earns $0.8 per task and Jenny earns $0.5 per task. Since they both completed 20 tasks, we can set up the following equation:

J = 0.8 * 20
Y = 0.5 * 20

Simplifying the equations, we get:

J = 16
Y = 10

To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

J - Y = 16 - 10
J - Y = 6

Therefore, Jairus earns $6 more than Jenny.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount of money Brad receives as x. Since Jeff receives four times as much as Brad, Jeff's share can be expressed as 4x.

The total amount of money, 100 dollars, is the sum of the amounts received by Jeff and Brad. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 100

Dividing both sides by 5, we find:

x = 20

Now that we have determined Brad's share, we can calculate Jeff's share by multiplying x by 4:

Jeff's share = 4x = 4(20) = 80

Therefore, Jeff receives 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To calculate the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we can utilize the formula for total distance traveled, which is the product of the daily distance and the number of days.

Let's denote the distance to work as d and the number of days worked per week as n. Since Jeff walks to and from work, the daily distance is 2d. Therefore, the total distance walked in a week is given by:

Total Distance = 2d * n

Given that the distance to work (d) is 3 miles and the number of days worked per week (n) is 5, we can substitute these values into the formula:

Total Distance = 2 * 3 * 5
Total Distance = 6 * 5
Total Distance = 30

Therefore, Jeff walks a total of 30 miles per week."
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we can break down the process into three distinct steps:

1. Initial alphabet writing: Elise writes the alphabet twice, which consists of 26 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters written in this step is 26 * 2 = 52.
2. Half of the alphabet: Elise writes half of the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.
3. Re-writing the entire previous work: Elise re-writes the 52 letters from the first step and the 13 letters from the second step, resulting in a total of 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is 65.

Final answer: $\boxed{65}$"
"The problem at hand involves a classic example of a branching process, where each family member's decision to call additional families creates a new generation of potential contacts. This scenario can be modeled using the concept of a geometric series.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first round, Ali initiates contact with 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 x 3 = 9 new contacts.
3. In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 x 3 = 27 new contacts.
4. In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 x 3 = 81 new contacts.

To find the total number of families notified, we can sum the number of new contacts in each round:

3 (initial contacts) + 9 (second round) + 27 (third round) + 81 (fourth round) = 120

Therefore, the total number of families notified during the fourth round is 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine Mark's initial weight, we can utilize the concept of linear decay. Given that Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, we can model this situation using the formula:

Initial weight = Final weight + (Weight loss per month * Number of months)

Plugging in the values provided, we get:

Initial weight = 70 + (10 * 3)
Initial weight = 70 + 30
Initial weight = 100

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"To determine the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as 'x'. According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: x + 2 = 5 * 80.

Simplifying the equation, we get x + 2 = 400.

Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we get x = 398.

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{398}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to purchase, we can apply the concept of a discount to the total cost of the items. The total cost of the items before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

The discount amount can be calculated as 10% of the total cost, which is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

To find the total cost after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount: $30 - $3 = $27.

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

The final answer is: $27"
"To calculate the total cost of Carly's order, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. 

First, we multiply the number of hamburgers by the cost per hamburger: 5 * $4 = $20.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the potato fries by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack: 10 * $0.30 = $3.

Then, we find the total cost of the fruit drinks by multiplying the number of cans by the cost per can: 5 * $2 = $10.

Now, we add the costs of the hamburgers, potato fries, and fruit drinks to find the total cost: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

To determine the change Carly receives, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill: $50 - $33 = $17.

Therefore, Carly gets $17 in change.

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we can break it down into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000.

The commission for sales up to $1000 can be calculated as 30% of $1000, which is equal to 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

The additional commission for sales over $1000 can be calculated as 10% of the amount exceeding $1000, which is 0.1 * ($2500 - $1000) = 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

Therefore, Antonella's total commission is the sum of these two amounts: $300 + $150 = $450.

The final answer is: $450"
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to purchase, we can employ a straightforward calculation.

Therefore, Bill needs to acquire 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{92}$"
"To determine the time difference between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day, we need to calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles in both scenarios.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes him to swim 3 miles, we can multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3:

t_cold = 3 × 16 = 48 minutes

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. First, we find the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day:

t_hot = 2 × 16 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3:

t_hot_3_miles = 3 × 34 = 102 minutes

The time difference between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day is:

Δt = t_hot_3_miles - t_cold = 102 - 48 = 54 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take John to save $80, we can use the formula for simple interest:

Weekly earnings = $2/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

To find the number of weeks required to save $80, we can divide the target amount by the weekly earnings:

Number of weeks = Total amount / Weekly earnings

The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40. To find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3.

Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 * $40
Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub = $120

Total cost for both subs = $40 + $120
Total cost for both subs = $160

Therefore, the total cost for lunch is $160."
"To determine the total number of holes in the bag of buttons, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the number of holes in each category of buttons and then summing the results.

Let's denote the total number of buttons with two holes as 'x' and the total number of buttons with four holes as 'y'. We are given that x + y = 21 (since there are 21 buttons in total).

We also know that the number of holes in the buttons with two holes is 2x and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes is 4y.

The total number of holes in the bag can be represented as 2x + 4y. Since we have two equations:

1) x + y = 21
2) 2x + 4y = total number of holes

We can solve for 'x' and 'y' using substitution or elimination methods. Let's use substitution.

Rearranging equation (1) to isolate 'x', we get x = 21 - y.

Substituting x = 21 - y into equation (2), we get:

2(21 - y) + 4y = total number of holes
42 - 2y + 4y = total number of holes
2y + 42 = total number of holes

Now, we need to find the value of 'y'. Since 'y' represents the number of buttons with four holes, it must be a non-negative integer. We can try different values of 'y' to find a valid solution.

Let's try y = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.

For y = 0, 2y + 42 = 42, which is not a multiple of 2, so it's not a valid solution.

For y = 1, 2y + 42 = 44, which is not a multiple of 2, so it's not a valid solution.

For y = 2, 2y + 42 = 46, which is not a multiple of 2, so it's not a valid solution.

For y = 3, 2y + 42 = 48, which is a multiple of 2, so it's a valid solution.

For y = 4, 2y + 42 = 50, which is not a multiple of 2, so it's not a valid solution.

For y = 5, 2y + 42 = 52, which is not a multiple of 2, so it's not a valid solution.

For y = 6, 2y + 42 = 54, which is not a multiple of 2, so it's not a valid solution.

For y = 7, 2y + 42 = 56, which is a multiple of 2, so it's a valid solution.

For y = 8, 2y + 42 = 58, which is not a multiple of 2, so it's not a valid solution.

For y = 9, 2y + 42 = 60, which is a multiple of 2, so it's a valid solution.

For y = 10, 2y + 42 = 62, which is not a multiple of 2, so it's not a valid solution.

For y = 11, 2y + 42 = 64, which is a multiple of 2, so it's a valid solution.

For y = 12, 2y + 42 = 66, which is not a multiple of 2, so it's not a valid solution.

For y = 13, 2y + 42 = 68, which is not a multiple of 2, so it's not a valid solution.

For y = 14, 2y + 42 = 70, which is a multiple of 2, so it's a valid solution.

For y = 15, 2y + 42 = 72, which is not a multiple of 2, so it's not a valid solution.

For y = 16, 2y + 42 = 74, which is not a multiple of 2, so it's not a valid solution.

For y = 17, 2y + 42 = 76, which is not a multiple of 2, so it's not a valid solution.

For y = 18, 2y + 42 = 78, which is not a multiple of 2, so it's not a valid solution.

For y = 19, 2y + 42 = 80, which is not a multiple of 2, so it's not a valid solution.

For y = 20, 2y + 42 = 82, which is not a multiple of 2, so it's not a valid solution.

Now that we have found the valid values of 'y', we can calculate the total number of holes for each valid solution:

For y = 3, total number of holes = 2x + 4y = 2(21 - 3) + 4(3) = 38

For y = 7, total number of holes = 2x + 4y = 2(21 - 7) + 4(7) = 42

For y = 9, total number of holes = 2x + 4y = 2(21 - 9) + 4(9) = 48

For y = 11, total number of holes = 2x + 4y = 2(21 - 11) + 4(11) = 54

For y = 14, total number of holes = 2x + 4y = 2(21 - 14) + 4(14) = 56

For y = 17, total number of holes = 2x + 4y = 2(21 - 17) + 4(17) = 62

For y = 19, total number of holes = 2x + 4y = 2(21 - 19) + 4(19) = 68

The total number of holes in the bag of buttons is 56.

The final answer is 56."
" locker size calculation

To determine the size of Peter's locker, we can apply the concept of proportional relationships. Given that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can express this relationship as a fraction: 1/4.

First, we need to find the size of Zack's locker, which is half the size of Timothy's locker. This can be calculated as:

Zack's locker size = Timothy's locker size / 2
= 24 / 2
= 12 cubic inches

Now, we can find the size of Peter's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 1/4:

Peter's locker size = Zack's locker size × 1/4
= 12 × 1/4
= 12 × 0.25
= 3 cubic inches

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches in size."
"To determine the reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake, we must first establish the amount he currently consumes. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, and the daily recommendation is 4 cups, Octavia's daily intake is 0.5 * 4 = 2 cups. 

Given that Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, his current intake is 2 * 10 = 20 cups.

The doctor has asked Juan to reduce his intake to 4 cups. To find the reduction, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 20 - 4 = 16.

However, this is the amount Juan must reduce from his current intake to meet the doctor's recommendation. The question asks by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake. Therefore, the reduction is 16 cups.

The answer is 16."
"To determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we can utilize the principle of addition. Given that there are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each and 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, we can calculate the total number of rodents as follows:

Let's denote the number of hamsters as H and the number of guinea pigs as G. We are given:

H = 3 * 10 = 30
G = 3 * 5 = 15

The total number of rodents (T) is the sum of the number of hamsters and guinea pigs:

T = H + G
T = 30 + 15
T = 45

Therefore, the pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we can utilize the formula for calculating the mean:

Average Weight = (Mark's Weight + Susan's Weight + Bob's Weight) / 3

Given Mark's weight is 150 pounds and Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, we can express Susan's weight as 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so we can express Bob's weight as 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can substitute these values into the formula:

Average Weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3
Average Weight = 540 / 3
Average Weight = 180

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To calculate the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we can utilize the concept of relative motion. The initial angle of the sun is 32 degrees, and it moves 5 degrees per hour. 

Let's denote the initial angle as θ0 = 32 degrees and the hourly rate of change as r = 5 degrees/hour. The total change in angle after 10 hours can be calculated using the formula:

Δθ = r * t

where t is the time in hours. Substituting the given values, we get:

Δθ = 5 * 10 = 50 degrees

Now, we can find the final angle by adding the initial angle and the change in angle:

θf = θ0 + Δθ
= 32 + 50
= 82 degrees

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

Final answer: 82"
"To determine the total cost of the birthday candles, we need to calculate the number of candles required and then multiply it by the cost per pack.

The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, so the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. Since James has two sons, he needs 2 * 5 = 10 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, the total cost will be 10 / 5 * 3 = 6.

Therefore, James will spend $6 on birthday candles.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of pages she read in the first week and the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, we need to find out how many minutes Judy spent reading in the first week. Since she read 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

15 minutes/night * 7 nights = 105 minutes

Next, we need to convert the total minutes into pages. We know that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5:

105 minutes ÷ 1.5 minutes/page = 70 pages

Now that we know Judy read 70 pages in the first week, we can add this to the 100 pages she read in the second week to find the total number of pages she read in two weeks:

70 pages + 100 pages = 170 pages

Therefore, Judy read a total of 170 pages in two weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{170}$"
"To determine the number of sandwiches left, we can calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor.

Cody ate 1/3 of the sandwiches, which can be represented as (1/3) × 12. 
Using the formula for fractions, we can simplify this to 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate 1/4 of the sandwiches, which can be represented as (1/4) × 12. 
Using the formula for fractions, we can simplify this to 3 sandwiches.

The total number of sandwiches eaten is the sum of the sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor, which is 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the initial number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5.

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is 5."
"To solve this problem, we can employ algebraic techniques to find the value of Shiloh's nephew's current age.

Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N. We are given that S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This relationship can be expressed as:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break down the problem into distinct components.

Let's denote the amount of money the tooth fairy left for the first tooth as $5.00. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, resulting in a total of 3 * $1.00 = $3.00. 

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To determine the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, the number of goals scored by Anna as A, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

We are given that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, which can be expressed as:
R = M + 20

We are also given that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, which can be expressed as:
R = A + 45

Since we know Richie scored 80 goals, we can substitute R = 80 into the first equation:
80 = M + 20

Solving for M, we get:
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

Now that we have the value of M, we can substitute it into the second equation to find A:
80 = A + 45

Solving for A, we get:
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we have the values of M and A, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:
Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Mitchell and Liam, we can calculate the total amount Mitchell made by multiplying the number of lemonades he sold (21) by the price of each lemonade ($4).

Let's perform the calculation:

21 × $4 = $84

$84 - $63 = $21

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we can break down his spending into two parts: the wooden action figures and the plastic action figures.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on wooden action figures. Peter spent $5 each day for 3 days (Sunday to Wednesday), so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:

$5 * 3 = $15

Since he had $70 initially, the remaining amount for the rest of the week is:

$70 - $15 = $55

Now, let's calculate the number of plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining amount. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

$55 ÷ $2 = 27.5

Since he can't buy half a figure, we'll round down to 27 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 3 wooden action figures and 27 plastic action figures.

The final answer is 30."
"To calculate the total cost of the kitten, we can break down the expenses into distinct components and apply basic arithmetic operations.

The cost of spaying the kitten is a one-time expense of $200. The cost of the vaccines can be calculated by multiplying the number of vaccines (3) by the cost per vaccine ($20), resulting in a total of $60. Additionally, the cost of the broken vases can be determined by multiplying the number of vases (4) by the cost per vase ($12), yielding a total of $48.

To find the overall cost, we can add these amounts together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

Therefore, the total cost of the kitten is $308."
"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses required and compare it to the number of roses he grows.

First, we calculate the total number of roses needed per month by multiplying the number of roses ordered by each shop by the number of weeks in a month (4 weeks). 

Total roses per week = 20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses/week
Total roses per month = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Since Ford grows 40 roses every week, we can calculate the number of roses he lacks per month by subtracting the number of roses he grows from the total number of roses needed:

Roses lacking per month = Total roses per month - Roses grown per month
= 260 roses/month - 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month
= 260 roses/month - 160 roses/month
= 100 roses/month

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To calculate the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we can utilize the concept of present value and the formula for calculating the future value of a series of periodic payments.

Let's break down the problem:

Initial amount: $3000
Monthly withdrawal: $100
Number of months: 24

We can model this situation using the formula for the future value of an annuity:

FV = PV x (1 + r)^n + PMT x [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r

where:
FV = Future Value
PV = Present Value (initial amount) = $3000
r = monthly interest rate (assuming 0% interest, as no interest rate is mentioned)
n = number of periods (months) = 24
PMT = monthly payment = -$100 (negative sign indicates withdrawal)

Since we're not considering interest, the formula simplifies to:

FV = PV - PMT x n

FV = $3000 - (-$100) x 24
FV = $3000 + $2400
FV = $5400

However, this calculation represents the total amount after 2 years, not the remaining amount. To find the remaining amount, we subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount:

Remaining amount = Initial amount - Total amount withdrawn
= $3000 - $2400
= $600

Therefore, the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years is $600."
"To calculate the net profit of the food truck, we need to consider the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. The number of sandwiches sold is 10, and the price per sandwich is $7.00. Therefore, the total revenue can be calculated as:

Total Revenue = Number of Sandwiches * Price per Sandwich
Total Revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total Revenue = $70.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost. The cost of bread per loaf is $3.00, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is:

Cost of Bread = Number of Loaves * Cost of Bread per Loaf
Cost of Bread = 1 * $3.00
Cost of Bread = $3.00

Additionally, the cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated as:

Total Cost = Cost of Bread + Cost of Cheese and Condiments
Total Cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total Cost = $33.00

Finally, the net profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Net Profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net Profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To determine the total number of muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to calculate the total number of crayons she has and then divide that by the number of crayons used per muffin.

First, we calculate the total number of crayons: 3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons.

Next, we divide the total number of crayons by 8 crayons/muffin to find the number of muffin crayons: 192 crayons / 8 crayons/muffin = 24 muffin crayons.

To find the total amount of money Kate can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin: 24 muffin crayons * $1.50/muffin = $36.

The final answer is $36."
"To calculate the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to consider the costs associated with the carpet, padding, removal, and installation.

Average = (50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90) / 7
= 280 / 7
= 40

Therefore, the average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 40."
"To determine the final value of the number train, we can break down the problem into a series of mathematical operations. Let's analyze the given information:

The starting value of the number train is 20.

The problem states that this starting value plus half the number was divided by 5. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

(20 + (20/2)) / 5

To simplify the expression, we can follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Calculate half of 20: 20/2 = 10
2. Add 20 to the result: 20 + 10 = 30
3. Divide the result by 5: 30 / 5 = 6

The resulting value is 6.

The problem then states that this resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

6 × (20 - 12)

To simplify the expression, we can follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Subtract 12 from 20: 20 - 12 = 8
2. Multiply 6 by the result: 6 × 8 = 48

Therefore, the final value of the number train is 48.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total number of cards, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations.

We can express the total number of cards as the sum of the cards the boy and his brother have: Total = B + Br.

Substituting Br with B - 3, we get: Total = B + (B - 3).

Combining like terms, we get: Total = 2B - 3.

Since we know B = 5, we can substitute this value into the equation: Total = 2(5) - 3.

Evaluating the expression, we get: Total = 10 - 3 = 7.

Therefore, the total number of cards is 7."
"To determine the correct temperature setting for Maggie's oven, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The oven is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees off. 
To find the percentage, we divide the difference by the original temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find 4% of 520. 
4% of 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

So, Maggie should set the oven to 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees.

The correct answer is: $\boxed{540.8}$"
"To determine the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we can utilize the concept of adding time intervals. 

First, we convert both times to minutes: 
1 hour and 30 minutes = 90 minutes
2 hours and 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the two times:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To calculate the combined value of the two houses, we need to find the value of Juan's house first. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we can calculate this by finding 30% of Herb's house value and subtracting it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value: $76,000
30% of Herb's house value: 0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house value: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, let's add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To determine the total number of utensils, we must first establish the quantities brought by Judy and her friend.

Judy initially purchased a dozen (12) cups. Since she brought twice as many dishes as cups, the number of dishes she brought is 2 * 12 = 24.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so the number of dishes her friend brought is 24 + 20 = 44.

The total number of cups is the sum of Judy's and her friend's cups: 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is the sum of Judy's and her friend's dishes: 24 + 44 = 68 dishes.

Therefore, the total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost of each pair of contacts, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the discounted price of 2 boxes of contacts. The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. To find the discounted price, we can calculate 10% of $100.00 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $100.00 is 0.10 x $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 x $90.00 = $180.00

Now, we can find the cost of each pair of contacts by dividing the total cost by the total number of pairs in 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes will contain 2 x 90 = 180 pairs.

Cost per pair = Total cost / Total pairs
= $180.00 / 180 pairs
= $1.00 per pair

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To calculate the earnings of Tabitha's helpers, we need to break down their individual work hours and rates.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. Given her hourly rate of $10, her total earnings can be calculated as 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which translates to 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He also worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, resulting in 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Therefore, John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. With an hourly rate of $10, his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To determine the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total calories burned during her activities.

The calories burned from aerobics can be calculated as follows:

Calories burned from aerobics = 500 calories/hour * 2 hours
Calories burned from aerobics = 1000 calories

The calories burned from running can be calculated as follows:

Calories burned from running = 600 calories/hour * 1 hour
Calories burned from running = 600 calories

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running:

Total calories burned = Calories burned from aerobics + Calories burned from running
Total calories burned = 1000 + 600
Total calories burned = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can calculate the total amount of water needed by dividing the total calories burned by 200:

Total water needed = Total calories burned / 200
Total water needed = 1600 / 200
Total water needed = 8

Therefore, Hannah needs 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{800}$"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of red, blue, and green jelly beans. Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:

R = 0.99B

Additionally, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:

G = 1.01B

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

2B + 0.99B = 4500

Combine like terms:

2.99B = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99:

B = 1500

Now that we have found the value of B, we can find the values of R and G:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"

Mean = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3
Mean = 156 / 3
Mean = 52

Therefore, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To determine the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we can calculate the total weight change over the 5-week period.

Let's denote the weight change per week for Cheerios as -1.25 pounds and for donuts as 1.75 pounds. The total weight change over 5 weeks can be calculated as:

Weight change for Cheerios = -1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds
Weight change for donuts = 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight between the two options is the absolute value of the weight change for donuts minus the weight change for Cheerios:

Difference in weight = |8.75 - (-6.25)| = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

Therefore, the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts is 15 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we can employ a systematic approach to account for the cascading invitations.

Initially, Alex invited 100 people. Each of these individuals will, in turn, invite 2 friends, resulting in a total of 100 * 2 = 200 additional guests. This brings the preliminary total to 100 + 200 = 300 people.

However, Alex also invited 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses. This adds 10 + 8 = 18 more individuals to the count. Therefore, the updated total is 300 + 18 = 318 people.

To ensure we have sufficient seating, we must consider the total number of attendees. In this scenario, the total number of people attending the event is 318.

The final answer is: $\boxed{318}$"
"To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we can follow the given information step by step.

First, we know the weight of the Affenpinscher is 10 pounds. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund's weight is 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

Next, the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, which is 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

Finally, the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff's weight is 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{220}$"
"To determine the cost difference between Amazon and eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16, and the shipping cost is $4. Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and the shipping cost is twice the shipping cost on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8. Thus, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

The difference in cost between Amazon and eBay can be calculated as follows:

Difference in cost = Total cost on eBay - Total cost on Amazon
= $21 - $20
= $1

"To determine the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to exceed Mark's window height, we can model the growth of the beanstalk using an exponential function. Given that the initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet and it doubles in height every day, we can express this growth as:

h(t) = 4 * 2^t

where h(t) is the height of the beanstalk at time t (in days).

We want to find the smallest integer value of t such that h(t) > 20.

20 < 4 * 2^t

Dividing both sides by 4:

5 < 2^t

Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides:

log2(5) < t

Using a calculator to approximate the value of log2(5), we get:

2.32 < t

Since t must be an integer, the smallest integer value of t that satisfies the inequality is 3.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total grams of protein John gets per week, we can utilize the concept of unit conversion and multiplication.

First, we need to establish the ratio of protein to mushrooms. Given that 1 cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein, we can express this as a ratio:

3 grams of protein / 100 grams of mushrooms = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms

Now, we can calculate the grams of protein John gets per day by multiplying the grams of mushrooms he consumes (200 grams) by the ratio:

200 grams of mushrooms * 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms = 6 grams of protein per day

Finally, we can calculate the total grams of protein John gets per week by multiplying the grams of protein per day by 7:

6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's represent Jerry's current age as 'x'. The given information states that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be translated into the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides yields:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides results in:

10 = x

Therefore, Jerry's current age is 10.

To determine Jerry's age in 3 years, we can add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Thus, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

Final answer: 13"
"To calculate the total cost of the dental work, we need to consider the base price of the implants and the additional cost of the crown. The base price of each implant is $2000, and George needs 2 implants, resulting in a total cost of 2 x $2000 = $4000. The crown, which is an additional feature for one of the implants, costs $500. Therefore, the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

Since George has already made a deposit of $600, we need to subtract this from the total cost to determine the remaining amount he needs to cover: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find out how many hours George needs to work to cover this remaining amount, we can divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage of $15: $3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"In a triangle, the sum of the interior angles is a fundamental property that can be expressed as:

A + B + C = 180°

where A, B, and C represent the measures of the three angles. Given that one angle is twice the smallest angle (A = 2a) and the third angle is three times the smallest angle (C = 3a), we can write the equation:

a + 2a + 3a = 180°

Combine like terms:

6a = 180°

Divide both sides by 6:

a = 30°

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30°, we can find the other two angles:

A = 2a = 2(30°) = 60°
C = 3a = 3(30°) = 90°

Therefore, the largest angle in the triangle is 90°."
"To determine the total number of gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and then divide it by the cost of a single gumball.

Colby has 8 quarters, which is equivalent to 8 x $0.25 = $2.00.
He also has 6 dimes, which is 6 x $0.10 = $0.60.
Additionally, he has 14 nickels, which is 14 x $0.05 = $0.70.
Lastly, he has 15 pennies, which is 15 x $0.01 = $0.15.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy: $3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69.

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we can apply basic arithmetic principles. 

First, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet: 

- Dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs
- Cats: 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs
- Birds: 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs

Now, we add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we can calculate 50% of the original weight and then add it to the original weight.

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

The new weight is the original weight plus the 50% increase: 8 + 4 = 12 pounds

However, Jamaal uses a weight two pounds lighter than that, so we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds

Therefore, the weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To calculate the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we can break down the problem into three parts: the number of games he receives as gifts, the number of games he purchases each year, and the total number of games he buys over the three years.

Let's denote the number of games Steve receives as gifts as G, the number of games he buys per month as M, and the number of months in a year as 12. We can express the total number of games he buys over the three years as the sum of the number of games he buys in each year.

Year 1: G + 12M
Year 2: G + 12M
Year 3: G + 24M

Since Steve receives 5 games as gifts each year, we can substitute G = 5 into the equation. We also know that M changes each year: 1 game per month in Year 1, 2 games per month in Year 2, and 4 games per month in Year 3.

Total games = (5 + 12M) + (5 + 12M) + (5 + 24M)
Total games = 15 + 48M

Since M is not explicitly stated, we cannot calculate the exact total. However, we can express the total number of games as a function of M.

To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need more information about M. Assuming M is a constant, we can calculate the total number of games for a specific value of M.

For example, if M = 1 (1 game per month), the total number of games would be:
Total games = 15 + 48(1) = 63

If M = 2 (2 games per month), the total number of games would be:
Total games = 15 + 48(2) = 111

If M = 4 (4 games per month), the total number of games would be:
Total games = 15 + 48(4) = 159

Since we cannot determine the exact value of M, we cannot provide a single numerical answer. However, we can express the total number of games as a function of M.

The final answer is: $\boxed{63, 111, or 159}$"
"To determine the additional time required to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we can utilize the concept of uniform motion. Given that the plane's speed is constant, we can apply the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

First, we need to calculate the speed of the plane, which we've already determined to be 400 miles per hour. Now, we can calculate the additional time required to travel 2000 miles:

Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Final answer: $\boxed{5}$"
"To calculate the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours, we need to determine their individual hourly production rates and then multiply those rates by the total number of hours worked.

Ruiz's production rate is 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour. 

Marissa's production rate is 3/4 times Ruiz's rate, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

The total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz in 12 hours is 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates made by Marissa in 12 hours is 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates made by both Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"
"To determine the amount of money Howard has left, we can calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from his original amount.

Let's break down his spending:

On Monday, he spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 x $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 x $16 = $64.

Total amount spent = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88

Original amount = $100

Amount left = Original amount - Total amount spent
= $100 - $88
= $12

Therefore, Howard has $12 left."
"To calculate the total earnings from selling lemonade, we can break down the problem into two periods: the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours.

For the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.50 per cup. This can be represented as:

15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
Total earnings for the first 4 hours = $7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.60 per cup. This can be represented as:

10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
Total earnings for the next 2 hours = $6/hour * 2 hours = $12

To find the total earnings, we add the earnings from both periods:

Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can calculate the total number of rotations per year and then divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by this value.

First, we need to find the number of rotations per mile:
725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations/mile

Now, we multiply the number of rotations per mile by the number of miles driven per month and then by 12 to find the total number of rotations per year:
362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month
145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Next, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the total number of rotations per year:
10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

Therefore, the tire needs to be replaced in 6 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the cost of each pump, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. 

Given that 2 pumps yield 120 washings, we can calculate the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of 120 washings by the number of washings per pump. 

Cost per pump = Total cost / Number of washings per pump
= $24.00 / 2
= $12.00

To convert the cost from dollars to cents, we can multiply by 100.

Cost per pump (in cents) = $12.00 * 100
= 1200 cents

Therefore, each pump costs 20 cents.

The final answer is 20."
"To calculate the total cost of the outfit, we need to first determine the discount on the shirt. The original price of the shirt is $25, and the discount is 30% of this amount.

Discount = 25 * 0.3
Discount = $7.50

The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Next, we add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit before tax:
$17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the tax amount:
$52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20

The total cost of the outfit with tax is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Now, we subtract the total cost from Joe's available budget to find the amount of money he will have left:
$50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe cannot have a negative amount of money, this indicates that he will not have enough funds to purchase the outfit."
"To determine the total amount of butter needed, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we can multiply the number of croissants by 1/4 to find the amount of butter needed per day.

Let's calculate the daily butter requirement:

4 dozen croissants/day × (1/4 pound/dozen) = 1 pound/day

To find the total butter needed for 7 days, we can multiply the daily amount by 7:

1 pound/day × 7 days = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants per day for a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the cost difference between repaving Monica's and Lewis' streets, we can calculate the cost of repaving each street separately and then find the difference.

The cost of repaving a street is given by the formula: Cost = Length × Rate

For Monica's street: Cost = 150 meters × $194/meter = $29,100

For Lewis' street: Cost = 490 meters × $194/meter = $94,660

The difference in cost is: $94,660 - $29,100 = $65,560

Therefore, it costs $65,560 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"To calculate the total cost of the research, we can break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months. 

The initial 5 months had a constant funding of $100,000 per month. Therefore, the total cost for these months is:

$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This is a classic example of a geometric progression (GP) with a first term of $100,000 and a common ratio of 1.5. The formula for the sum of a GP is:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = $100,000, r = 1.5, and n = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = $100,000 * (1 - 1.5^5) / (1 - 1.5)
S = $100,000 * (1 - 7.59375) / (-0.5)
S = $100,000 * (-6.59375) / (-0.5)
S = $100,000 * 13.1875
S = $1,318,750

Now, we add the cost of the initial 5 months and the cost of the remaining 5 months:

$500,000 + $1,318,750 = $1,818,750

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is $1,818,750."
"To calculate the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to consider the individual contributions of each player.

The first player consumed 6 ounces of steak. The second player consumed 8 ounces of beef tips, with each tip weighing 1 ounce. Therefore, the total ounces of beef tips consumed by the second player is 8. The third player consumed a 1-pound steak, which is equivalent to 16 ounces. Since the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, they did not consume any meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To calculate the total number of posts in March, we can utilize the concept of daily posting frequency and the number of days in the month. Given that each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, we can multiply the daily posting frequency by the total number of days in March.

Total number of posts in March = Daily posting frequency * Total number of days in March
Total number of posts in March = 3 * 31
Total number of posts in March = 93

Therefore, the total number of posts in March is 93."
"To calculate the total cost of water for laundry in a year, we can employ the formula:

Total Cost = Number of Loads per Year * Gallons per Load * Cost per Gallon

Given that Gary does laundry twice a week, the number of loads per year is 52 weeks * 2 = 104 loads.

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so the total gallons of water used per year is 104 loads * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons.

The cost of a gallon of water is $0.15, so the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 gallons * $0.15/gallon = $312.

Therefore, the total cost of water for laundry in a year is $312."
"To calculate the total cost of Scarlett's purchases, we can break down the expenses into individual components and then sum them up.

The aquarium initially costs $10.00. 

The cost of the rocks is 2 bags at $2.50 each, which can be calculated as 2 x $2.50 = $5.00.

The cost of the coral is 3 pieces at $2.00 each, which can be calculated as 3 x $2.00 = $6.00.

The cost of the fish is 20 fish at $0.50 each, which can be calculated as 20 x $0.50 = $10.00.

The cost of the fish food is $2.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together:

$10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00

Therefore, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."
"To determine the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we can apply the concept of exponential growth. The initial height is 3 inches, and it doubles in height every week. In the third week, it grows an additional 4 inches.

The height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks can be calculated as follows:

Week 1: 3 inches
Week 2: 3 * 2 = 6 inches
Week 3: 6 + 4 = 10 inches

Therefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. 

First, we need to calculate the daily meat sales, which is given as 15kg per hour multiplied by 10 hours, resulting in 150kg per day. 

Now, we divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the daily meat sales (150kg) to find the number of days it will take to sell the meat.

750kg ÷ 150kg per day = 5 days

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"To determine the number of students in the school auditorium, we must first calculate the total number of seats and then subtract the occupied seats by administrators and parents.

The total number of seats can be found by multiplying the number of rows by the number of seats in each row:
Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

The number of seats occupied by administrators is one-fourth of the total seats:
Seats occupied by administrators = 72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

The remaining seats are:
72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

The number of seats occupied by parents is one-third of the remaining seats:
Seats occupied by parents = 54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats

The remaining seats are occupied by students:
Seats occupied by students = 54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To calculate the total number of functioning street lights, we can employ the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

First, we need to determine the total number of street lights at all intersections. Since each intersection has 6 poles, and each pole has 4 street lights, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 4 * 6 = 24.

With 4 intersections in total, the overall number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

Next, we must account for the non-functioning street lights. We are informed that 20 street lights are not functioning. To find the number of functioning street lights, we subtract the non-functioning lights from the total: 96 - 20 = 76.

Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is 76."
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played, we need to consider the number of times each DVD has been played and its remaining lifespan.

Let's calculate the remaining lifespan of each DVD:

DVD 1: 1000 - 356 = 644 times left
DVD 2: 1000 - 135 = 865 times left

The total number of times both DVDs can be played is the sum of their remaining lifespans: 644 + 865 = 1509.

Therefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509."
"To calculate the total cost of John's physical therapy, we can employ the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

First, we need to determine the total number of hours John attended therapy. Since he attended twice a week for 6 weeks, we can express this as:

2 sessions/week * 6 weeks = 12 sessions

Each session is 2 hours long, so the total number of hours is:

12 sessions * 2 hours/session = 24 hours

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total number of hours by the cost per hour:

24 hours * $125/hour = $3000

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000."
"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we can break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours, and the school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the total number of pieces chewed at school as follows:

8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces

Additionally, Jim chews 1 piece of gum on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, for a total of:

4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces

Now, we subtract the total number of pieces chewed from the initial amount of gum:

20 (initial gum) - 6 (gum chewed) = 14 pieces

Finally, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister. To find the number of pieces Jim has left, we subtract 7 from 14:

14 - 7 = 7

Therefore, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine Charmaine's current age, we can use a simple subtraction operation. Since Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can calculate her current age by subtracting 12 from 16.

Let's perform the calculation:

16 - 12 = 4

Now, to find Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we can add 4 to her current age.

4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

Answer: 8"
"To determine the difference in spending between the two coaches, we can calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference.

The baseball coach purchased 9 baseballs at $3 each, resulting in a total expenditure of 9 × $3 = $27.

The basketball coach purchased 8 basketballs at $14 each, resulting in a total expenditure of 8 × $14 = $112.

To find the difference in spending, we subtract the total amount spent by the baseball coach from the total amount spent by the basketball coach:

$112 - $27 = $85

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To determine the number of bloomed flowers in Arianna's garden, we can apply the concept of proportional reasoning. Since 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we can calculate the number of bloomed flowers by multiplying the total number of flowers by this fraction.

Let's break it down step by step:

Total flowers = 10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

To find the number of bloomed flowers, we multiply the total number of flowers by the fraction that have bloomed (4/5):

Number of bloomed flowers = Total flowers * Fraction bloomed
= 200 * (4/5)
= 200 * 4 / 5
= 800 / 5
= 160

Therefore, the number of flowers in Arianna's garden that have bloomed is 160.

Final answer: 160"
"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we must first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. This can be achieved by dividing the given speed by 1000, as 1 Mb equals 1000 kb.

Let's perform the calculation:

20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Next, we need to convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, we can multiply the speed by 60 twice:

0.02 Mb/second × 60 seconds/minute × 60 minutes/hour = 0.02 × 60 × 60 Mb/hour
= 72 Mb/hour

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed that week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of cars towed on the first three days and the number of cars towed on the remaining four days.

Let's denote the number of cars towed on each of the first three days as 'a' and the number of cars towed on each of the remaining four days as 'b'. We are given that 'a' is 10 and 'b' is 10 - 4 = 6.

The total number of cars towed on the first three days is 3a, and the total number of cars towed on the remaining four days is 4b. Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is 3a + 4b.

Substituting the values of 'a' and 'b', we get:
3(10) + 4(6) = 30 + 24 = 54

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Adam to meet the height requirement, we can set up a simple linear equation. Let's denote the number of years as 't'. Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, his height after 't' years can be represented as:

Height = Initial Height + (Annual Growth Rate * Time)
Height = 40 + 2t

We want to find the value of 't' when the height is at least 48 inches (4 feet). So, we set up the inequality:

40 + 2t ≥ 48

Subtract 40 from both sides:

2t ≥ 8

Divide both sides by 2:

t ≥ 4

Since 't' represents the number of years, it must be a whole number. Therefore, the minimum number of years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster is 4 years.

Final answer: 4"
"To calculate James' earnings, we need to determine the profit made on each car and then apply the commission rate.

The cost of each car is $25,000, and the company pays 30% of this amount, which is $7,500. The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost: $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

The commission rate is 10%, so James' commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To determine the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to calculate the percentage of male riders who can stay upright. Given that 25% of the riders can stay upright and 60% of these riders are women, we can find the percentage of male riders who can stay upright by subtracting the percentage of women from 100%.

Let's calculate the percentage of male riders who can stay upright:

Percentage of male riders who can stay upright = 100% - 60% = 40%

Now, we can find the number of male riders who can stay upright by multiplying the total number of riders (100) by the percentage of male riders who can stay upright (40% or 0.4):

Number of male riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.4
= 40

Therefore, 40 men can stay upright on the wave.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the total price of all three jewels, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we know the price of a diamond jewel is $2000. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can express this relationship as a mathematical equation:

P_g = (4/5)P_d

where P_g represents the price of the gold jewel and P_d represents the price of the diamond jewel.

Substituting the given value for P_d, we get:

P_g = (4/5)(2000)
P_g = 1600

Next, we are told that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. We can express this relationship as:

P_s = P_g - 400

Substituting the value of P_g, we get:

P_s = 1600 - 400
P_s = 1200

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding the prices of diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = P_d + P_g + P_s
= 2000 + 1600 + 1200
= 4800

Therefore, the total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

We are given the following information:

1. S = 16 (number of snowflake stamps)
2. T = S + 3 (number of truck stamps is 3 more than the number of snowflake stamps)
3. R = T - 9 (number of rose stamps is 9 fewer than the number of truck stamps)

We can substitute the value of S into the second equation to find T: T = 16 + 3 = 19.

Next, we can substitute the value of T into the third equation to find R: R = 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding the number of each type of stamp: Total = S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

Therefore, the total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To determine the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we can utilize the concept of relative motion. Since they are moving in the same direction, we calculate the relative speed by subtracting Tom's speed from Bob's speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since they are moving in the same direction, we consider the absolute difference in their speeds. The negative sign indicates that Tom is moving in the opposite direction.

Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can apply the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Final answer: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of fish caught by Naomi as N, the number caught by Darren as D, and the number caught by Tommy as T.

We are given that Naomi caught 17 fish, so N = 17.

We also know that Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, so D = N - 6.

Substituting the value of N, we get D = 17 - 6 = 11.

Furthermore, we are told that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so T = D + 3.

Substituting the value of D, we get T = 11 + 3 = 14.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to consider the total cost of the classes and the maximum cost per class.

Let's denote the total cost of the classes as C and the maximum cost per class as M. We are given that C = $60 and M = $10. We can calculate the maximum number of classes his parents are willing to pay for as follows:

C / M = 60 / 10 = 6

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, we can find the maximum number of classes he can miss by subtracting the number of classes he has already attended from the total number of classes:

Maximum number of classes that can be missed = Total number of classes - Number of classes already attended
= 10 - 6
= 4

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total weekly production, we must first calculate the daily production of each individual. 

Jewel processes 50 customers per day, while Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast, resulting in a daily production of 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

The combined daily production is 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize the given information to establish an equation. Let's denote the number of miles Lynn ran as 'L'. We know that Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is 4 miles, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles. Additionally, Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so we can set up the equation:

20 = L + 3

To solve for L, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

L = 20 - 3
L = 17

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we can apply the concept of unit prices and multiplication.

First, we need to find the unit price of one apple and one orange. 

The unit price of one apple is $5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30
The unit price of one orange is $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges by multiplying their respective unit prices by the quantity and adding them together:

Cost of 5 apples = 5 x $1.30 = $6.50
Cost of 5 oranges = 5 x $1.10 = $5.50

Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To calculate the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to determine the volume of the hole and then multiply it by the time it takes to shovel a cubic foot of earth.

The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the hole) is given by the formula:

Volume = length * width * depth

In this case, the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the depth is 3 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3:

Time = Volume * 3
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To calculate the total cost of Bill's new truck, we can break down the costs of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade is $7,500, which can be represented as $7,500. Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so their cost is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so their cost is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs using the associative property of addition:

$30,000 + $7,500 = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 = $43,500

Therefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new salary, we need to first calculate the raise and bonus.

The raise is 5% of his current monthly salary of $20,000. This can be calculated as:

Raise = 0.05 x $20,000 = $1,000

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is:

Bonus = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, we add the raise and bonus to his current monthly salary to get his new monthly salary:

New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

To calculate the yearly salary, we multiply the new monthly salary by 12:

Yearly salary = $31,000 x 12 = $372,000

The final answer is: $372,000"
"To calculate the total cost of James' purchases, we can break down the costs as follows:

The cost of suits: 10 suits * $750 per suit = $7,500
The cost of dress pants: 10 pants * (1/5 * $750) = 10 * $150 = $1,500
The cost of dress shirts: 10 shirts * $60 per shirt = $600

Now, let's add the costs together: $7,500 + $1,500 + $600 = $9,600

Therefore, the total cost of everything is $9,600."
"To calculate the total number of articles published by the two websites in February, we can utilize the concept of multiplication and addition. 

First, we'll calculate the total number of articles published by the news website, which averages 20 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, we can express this as:

20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

Next, we'll calculate the total number of articles published by the sister company, which averages 10 articles per day. Similarly, we can express this as:

10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, we'll add the total number of articles published by both websites to obtain the overall total:

560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

Therefore, the total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To determine the age of Steve's son's wife, we can break down the problem into a series of linear equations based on the given information.

Let's denote Steve's age as S, his wife's age as W, their son's age as T, and his son's wife's age as X.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. S = 60 (Steve's age)
2. W = S + 4 (Steve's wife is 4 years older than him)
3. T = W / 2 (Their son is half as old as his mom)
4. X = T - 3 (Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband)

We can substitute equation (2) into equation (3) to find T:
T = (S + 4) / 2
T = (60 + 4) / 2
T = 64 / 2
T = 32

Now that we have T, we can find X:
X = T - 3
X = 32 - 3
X = 29

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour in three bags, we can utilize the concept of multiplication. Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion.

Let's denote the number of portions as 'n' and the weight of each portion as 'w'. In this case, n = 8 and w = 2 kilograms. The total weight of flour in one bag can be calculated as:

Total weight = n * w
Total weight = 8 * 2
Total weight = 16 kilograms

Since we are asked to find the total amount of flour in three bags, we can multiply the total weight of one bag by 3:

Total weight in three bags = 3 * 16
Total weight in three bags = 48 kilograms

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags is 48 kilograms."
"To determine the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we can apply the formula for distance, which is:

Distance = Speed × Time

For Alisa, the distance she biked is:
12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

For Stanley, the distance he biked is:
10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, let's add the distances together:
54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To determine the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we can break down the problem into two parts: digging through the soil and digging through the clay.

Let's calculate the time it takes to dig through each material:

Time to dig through soil: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours
Time to dig through clay: 8 feet / (1/2) feet/hour = 8 * 2 = 16 hours

Since these are independent tasks, we can add the times together to find the total time:

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 16 hours
Total time = 22 hours

Therefore, it will take Bill 22 hours to dig the well.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we can employ the concept of multiplication to calculate the total number of cupcakes required. 

First, we need to calculate the number of cupcakes for his classmates: 25 students * 2 cupcakes per student = 50 cupcakes. 

Next, we add the cupcakes for Howie and his teacher: 2 cupcakes (Howie) + 2 cupcakes (teacher) = 4 cupcakes.

Now, we can find the total number of cupcakes by adding the cupcakes for the students, Howie, and the teacher: 50 cupcakes + 4 cupcakes = 54 cupcakes.

Therefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the total number of likes, we can start by finding the initial number of likes. Since the number of likes after three weeks is 70 times the initial number, we can set up the equation:

Initial likes + 20000 = 70 * Initial likes

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Initial likes + 20000 = 70Initial likes

Subtracting Initial likes from both sides gives us:

20000 = 69Initial likes

Dividing both sides by 69, we get:

Initial likes = 20000 / 69
Initial likes = 288.52

Now, we can add the 20000 new likes to the initial likes to find the total number of likes:

Total likes = Initial likes + 20000
Total likes = 288.52 + 20000
Total likes = 20128.52

The final answer is: $oxed{20128.52}$"
"To determine the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we can calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off. So, the total cost on Tuesday is:
20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
$2 discount = $400 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost on Wednesday is:
20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
10% discount = $600 * 0.1 = $60
$60 discount = $600 - $60 = $540

The difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $398 - $540 = -$142.

The final answer is: $142"
"To determine the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we can break down the problem into two parts.

First, we need to find the sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

Red Hat Sales = 1/2 x Green Hat Sales
$400 = 1/2 x Green Hat Sales
Green Hat Sales = 2 x $400
Green Hat Sales = $800

Next, we can find the total sales in the first month by adding the sales from red and green hats:

Total Sales (Month 1) = Red Hat Sales + Green Hat Sales
Total Sales (Month 1) = $400 + $800
Total Sales (Month 1) = $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. We can calculate this as:

Total Sales (Month 2) = 3/4 x Total Sales (Month 1)
Total Sales (Month 2) = 3/4 x $1200
Total Sales (Month 2) = $900

Finally, we can find the total sales in two months by adding the sales from both months:

Total Sales (Two Months) = Total Sales (Month 1) + Total Sales (Month 2)
Total Sales (Two Months) = $1200 + $900
Total Sales (Two Months) = $2100

The final answer is: $2100"
"To calculate the total cost of the horse-drawn carriage rental, we can break down the problem into two parts: the initial paid hour and the subsequent hours.

The initial paid hour costs $15. The remaining hours are 4 - 1 = 3 hours. Since each hour after the first is twice the cost of the first hour, the cost of the remaining 3 hours is 2 * $15 * 3 = $90.

The total cost is the sum of the initial paid hour and the cost of the remaining hours: $15 + $90 = $105.

The final answer is: $105"
"To determine the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we can use the following calculation:

Weekly wage: $300
Bank account balance: $420

The difference between the weekly wage and the bank account balance represents the amount withheld. To find this difference, we subtract the bank account balance from the weekly wage:

$300 - $420 = -$120

Since the result is negative, it indicates that the bank account was overdrawn by $120. This means that $120 was withheld from Sally's wage.

The amount withheld from Sally's wage is $120."
"To determine the number of eggs required for the party, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Lori needs 2 deviled egg halves per egg, and each guest will consume 3 deviled egg halves. With 16 guests attending, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves/guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since 2 deviled egg halves are required per egg, we can calculate the total number of eggs needed as follows:

48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 eggs

To convert this to dozens, we can divide by 12:

24 eggs / 12 = 2

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozen eggs for the party."
"To determine the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we can calculate the fraction of the paper she has completed and subtract it from the total number of pages.

Since Shiela has completed 1/3 of the paper, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 1 by 3:

1/3 = 1 ÷ 3 = 0.33

Now, we can multiply this decimal by the total number of pages to find the number of pages she has completed:

Pages completed = 0.33 × 15
= 4.95

To find the number of pages left to write, we subtract the number of pages completed from the total number of pages:

Pages left to write = Total pages - Pages completed
= 15 - 4.95
≈ 10.05

Therefore, Shiela has approximately 10 pages left to write."
"To determine the number of days it will take Mike to finish the book, we can employ a straightforward division operation.

Let's calculate the number of days required to complete the book:

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we can find the number of days before the deadline by subtracting the number of days required to finish the book from the deadline:

Days before deadline = Deadline - Number of days
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase price, monthly expenses, and the compounding effect of these costs over 12 months.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5,000, and the monthly fuel cost is twice the rent, which is $10,000.

The total monthly cost is the sum of the rent and fuel costs: $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12: $15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

Therefore, the total cost of the plane for the first year is $150,000 (initial purchase price) + $180,000 (total monthly cost) = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To determine the total cooking time, we can break down the problem into its components. Let's denote the cooking time for rice as R, pork as P, and beans as B. We are given that R = 30 minutes and P = R + 20. We also know that B = (P + R) / 2.

First, we can substitute the value of P into the equation for B: B = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the individual cooking times: Total Time = R + P + B = 30 + (30 + 20) + 25 = 30 + 50 + 25 = 105 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{105}$"
"To determine the cost difference between the two mixtures, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the cost of 1 pound of almonds as A and the cost of 1 pound of walnuts as W.

We are given that A = $10 and W = $15.

The cost of the first mixture is 1/2A + 1/3W, and the cost of the second mixture is 1/5A + 1/3W.

To find the difference in cost, we can set up the following equation:

(1/2A + 1/3W) - (1/5A + 1/3W) = ?

First, we can simplify the equation by combining like terms:

(1/2A - 1/5A) + (1/3W - 1/3W) = ?

This simplifies to:

(3/10A) + 0 = ?

Since 1/3W cancels out, we are left with:

(3/10)A

Now, we can substitute the given value of A:

(3/10) * $10 = $3

Therefore, the difference in cost between the two mixtures is $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20.

The total number of animal legs is 70, so we can write the equation:
4s + 2g = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so we can write another equation:
s + g = 20

We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Rearranging the second equation to isolate 'g', we get:
g = 20 - s

Substituting this expression for 'g' into the first equation, we get:
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s + 40 = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to determine the cost of the coffee and the donut separately. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, that's 7 pounds. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is $1, so the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. 

7 pounds of the more expensive brand will cost 7 x $6 = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2.

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we must first calculate the total cost of the items Gus purchased, excluding the pie. 

The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00. Adding the cost of a bucket of fried chicken ($8.00) and a bottle of soda ($1.00), we get $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00.

Since Gus spent a total of $20.00, the cost of the apple pie can be found by subtracting the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is $7.00."
"To determine the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we can utilize the principle of subtraction. Given that James delivers a total of 600 newspapers and the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C are known, we can calculate the number of newspapers delivered to District B as follows:

Let's denote the number of newspapers delivered to District B as x. We can set up the equation:

x + 198 + 209 = 600

Combining like terms, we get:

x + 407 = 600

Subtracting 407 from both sides of the equation yields:

x = 600 - 407

x = 193

Therefore, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine the total number of recipes John learns, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class. Since the class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, we can express this as a product of the number of times the class meets per week and the duration of each class:

Total hours = (Number of times the class meets per week) × (Duration of each class)
Total hours = 4 × 2
Total hours = 8 hours

Next, we need to find the number of recipes John learns per hour. According to the problem, he learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. We can express this as a ratio:

Recipes per hour = 1 / 1.5
Recipes per hour = 2/3

Now, we can calculate the total number of recipes John learns by multiplying the total number of hours by the number of recipes he learns per hour:

Total recipes = Total hours × Recipes per hour
Total recipes = 8 × (2/3)
Total recipes = 16/3
Total recipes = 5.33

Since we cannot have a fraction of a recipe, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the problem does not explicitly state that recipes must be whole numbers, so we will provide the exact value.

The final answer is 16/3."
"To determine the number of math teachers, we can calculate 100% of the total number of teachers minus the percentage of history teachers.

Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - (Percentage of history teachers * Total number of teachers)
= 150 - (0.6 * 150)
= 150 - 90
= 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
60 * 6
= 360 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the amount of money each person would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to find the amount of money each person has. We are given that Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:

Kassidy's amount = (3/4) * Aurelia's amount
= (3/4) * 120
= 90

Next, we are told that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:

Rayna's amount = Kassidy's amount + 60
= 90 + 60
= 150

Now, let's add up the money of all three: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To share the money equally among them, we divide the total amount by 3:

Total amount ÷ 3 = 360 ÷ 3
= 120

Therefore, each person would have $120.

Final answer: $120"
"In basketball games, the duration of each quarter is a standard 12 minutes. Given that the game consists of four quarters, we can calculate the total time as follows:

Total time = Number of quarters * Time per quarter
Total time = 4 * 12 minutes
Total time = 48 minutes

However, the game was extended by 5 minutes due to a tie in the last quarter. To find the total duration of the game, we need to add the extra time to the regular total:

Total time = 48 minutes + 5 minutes
Total time = 53 minutes

Therefore, the entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"To determine the number of employees who oversee the company, we can break down the problem into two steps. First, we find 20% of the total employees, which represents the management staff. Then, we calculate 30% of this subset to identify the employees who oversee the entire company.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Number of management staff = 0.20 * Total employees
= 0.20 * 50
= 10 employees

Now, we find 30% of the management staff to determine the number of employees who oversee the company:

Number of employees who oversee the company = 0.30 * Number of management staff
= 0.30 * 10
= 3 employees

Therefore, there are 3 employees who oversee the entire company."
"To determine the total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins, we can apply the concept of scalar multiplication. 

For flour, we multiply the amount per muffin (5 tablespoons) by the number of muffins (16): 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons.

For sugar, we multiply the amount per muffin (3 tablespoons) by the number of muffins (16): 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons.

For salt, we multiply the amount per muffin (0.25 tablespoons) by the number of muffins (16): 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons.

The total amount of dry ingredients needed is the sum of these individual amounts: 80 tablespoons (flour) + 48 tablespoons (sugar) + 4 tablespoons (salt) = 132 tablespoons.

Therefore, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins.

The final answer is: $\boxed{132}$"
"To determine the amount of candy each person would have if they pool and share it equally, we need to calculate the total amount of candy and then divide it by 3.

The total amount of candy is the sum of the individual amounts: 3 pounds (Robert) + 5 pounds (Cindy) + 4 pounds (Aaron) = 12 pounds.

To find the amount each person would have, we divide the total amount by 3: 12 pounds ÷ 3 = 4 pounds.

Therefore, each person would have 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the candies, we can apply the concept of weighted averages. The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5, and the cost of one candy of type B is $0.75. We can represent the total cost as a weighted sum:

Total Cost = (Cost of A) * (Number of A) + (Cost of B) * (Number of B)
Total Cost = $0.5 * 7 + $0.75 * 10
Total Cost = $3.50 + $7.50
Total Cost = $11

Since Adam paid the cashier $15, we can calculate the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount paid:

Change = Amount Paid - Total Cost
Change = $15 - $11
Change = $4

Therefore, the change Adam received is $4."
"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we can analyze the given information as follows:

Let's break down the information:

- Christina had 12 good days initially.
- The first 8 days were good, leaving 12 - 8 = 4 good days.
- The second 8 days were bad, which doesn't affect the count of good days.
- The third 8 days were neutral, which also doesn't affect the count of good days.
- The next 3 days were good, adding to the initial 12 good days.

To find the total number of good days, we add the initial good days and the additional good days: 12 + 3 = 15.

Since the question asks for the number of good days left in the month, we need to subtract the total number of good days from the total number of days in the month (30). However, we must consider that the first 8 days were good, and the next 3 days were good. Therefore, we should subtract the total number of good days from the total number of days, but we need to be cautious about double-counting the good days.

The correct approach is to subtract the good days from the total days, but since the first 8 days were already accounted for, we should subtract the additional 3 good days from the remaining days: 30 - 8 (initial good days) - 3 (additional good days) = 19.

The final answer is 19."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as x. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can express this relationship as an equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To isolate x, we'll first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize the concept of unit rates. The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. We need to find the number of days it takes for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

First, we can calculate the total growth required: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Next, we can divide the total growth by the daily growth rate to find the number of days: 360 ÷ 30 = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

Final answer: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we can break down the problem into stages.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, which implies a ratio of 1 toy per dog. With 8 additional dogs, the total number of dogs becomes 4 + 8 = 12. Since each dog requires one toy, James initially needs 12 toys.

However, upon returning, James finds that 3 dogs have left, reducing the number of dogs to 12 - 3 = 9. Consequently, James no longer needs the toys for the 3 absent dogs. Therefore, he needs 9 toys for the remaining 9 dogs.

To find the total number of toys James needs, we can calculate the difference between the initial number of toys required and the number of toys he already has. Initially, James needed 12 toys, but he has 4 toys. The additional toys he needs are 12 - 4 = 8.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the amount invested by Skyler, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we find the amount invested by Dylan, which is 2/5 of the total amount. This can be calculated as:

Dylan's investment = (2/5) × 1200
= (2 × 1200) / 5
= 2400 / 5
= 480

Next, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount:
Remaining amount = 1200 - 480
= 720

Then, we calculate Frances' investment, which is 2/3 of the remaining amount:
Frances' investment = (2/3) × 720
= (2 × 720) / 3
= 1440 / 3
= 480

Finally, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find Skyler's investment:
Skyler's investment = 720 - 480
= 240

Therefore, Skyler's investment was $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the number of signatures the sisters need to collect, we can calculate the difference between their desired total and the number of signatures they have already collected.

Let's denote the number of signatures Carol has as C and the number of signatures Jennifer has as J. We know that C = 20 and J = 44. The total number of signatures they want to collect is 100. 

The number of signatures they need to collect can be found by subtracting the total signatures they already have from their goal: 
Total signatures needed = Total desired signatures - Total signatures already collected
Total signatures needed = 100 - (C + J)
Total signatures needed = 100 - (20 + 44)
Total signatures needed = 100 - 64
Total signatures needed = 36

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To determine Karen's earnings, we must first calculate her hourly wage, as it is given that she earns twice what Lorie earns. Since Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage is:

2 * $10 = $20 per hour

Next, we need to calculate Karen's daily earnings. Given that she works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings can be calculated as:

$20 per hour * 3 hours per day = $60 per day

Finally, to find Karen's earnings for two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:

$60 per day * 2 days = $120

Therefore, Karen earns $120 in two days."
"To determine the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can utilize the concept of proportional reasoning. Given that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns, we can establish a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns

To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion and solve for the unknown quantity:

(6 potatoes / 36 hash browns) = (96 potatoes / x hash browns)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

6x = 96 * 36

Simplifying the equation:

6x = 3456

Dividing both sides by 6:

x = 3456 / 6

x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can be used to make 576 hash browns.

Answer: 576"
"To determine the excess weight, we need to calculate the total weight of the 9 individuals and then subtract the maximum load capacity of the elevator.

The weight of one adult is 80 kg. To find the total weight of 9 adults, we multiply the weight of one adult by 9:

Total weight = 9 × 80 kg = 720 kg

Since the maximum load capacity of the elevator is 700 kg, we subtract this from the total weight to find the excess:

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

Therefore, the group of 9 adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"To determine the total number of cookies, we can utilize a step-by-step approach to solve the problem.

First, we establish the number of cookies each individual has:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Max has 5 more cookies than Katarina, so Max's cookies = 68 + 5 = 73.
3. The Cookie Monster has 12 fewer cookies than Max, so the Cookie Monster's cookies = 73 - 12 = 61.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer's cookies = 73 + 23 = 96.

Now, we can calculate the total number of cookies by adding the individual amounts:
Total cookies = Katarina's cookies + Max's cookies + Cookie Monster's cookies + Summer's cookies
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
Total cookies = 298

The final answer is: $\boxed{298}$"
"To determine the original length of the dress, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the original length of the dress as x.

The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, which can be represented as 0.5x. Then, 20cm is added to the bottom of the dress. The final length of the dress is 140cm. We can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we'll first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 120

Next, we'll divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 120 / 1.5

x = 80

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm."
"To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we can employ the concept of average speed. Since Chris mowed half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, we can calculate the average time as follows:

Let's denote the time taken to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode as T and the time taken to mow the entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode as R. We know that T = 60 minutes and R = 40 minutes.

The total time taken to mow the entire lawn is the sum of the time taken for each half, which is T + R. Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we can calculate the average time as:

Average time = (T + R) / 2

Substituting the given values, we get:

Average time = (60 + 40) / 2
Average time = 100 / 2
Average time = 50 minutes

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the time left before John and Jack arrive at school, we must first calculate the total time spent on the journey so far. 

The time taken to reach the corner where the library is is 6 minutes, and the time taken to reach the fire station is 13 minutes. 

Time spent so far = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Since the total available time is 30 minutes, we can calculate the remaining time by subtracting the time spent so far from the total available time.

Time left = Total time available - Time spent so far
Time left = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Time left = 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late."
"To calculate the total cost, we can apply the principle of arithmetic addition. 

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4. 
The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 x $2 = $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 x $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Therefore, the total cost is $14."
"To determine the total number of cookies in the box, we must first calculate the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda. Since Greta bakes 30 cookies and Celinda bakes twice as many, we can express this as an equation:

Let's denote the number of cookies Greta bakes as G and the number of cookies Celinda bakes as C. We know that C = 2G. Given that G = 30, we can find C by substituting the value of G into the equation:

C = 2G
C = 2(30)
C = 60

Now, we can find the total number of cookies baked by adding G and C:

Total cookies = G + C
Total cookies = 30 + 60
Total cookies = 90

Since the pair eats 10 cookies, the number of cookies left in the box is:

Cookies in the box = Total cookies - 10
Cookies in the box = 90 - 10
Cookies in the box = 80

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic methods to represent the ages of the twins and triplets. Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as x. Since there are two sets of siblings, we can represent the ages of the twins and triplets as follows:

- Younger triplet: x
- Older triplet: x + 7
- Older twin: x + 14

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are given as 44. We can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 14 = 7.67 + 14 = 21.67.

However, since the ages must be whole numbers, we can re-examine the equation. Let's re-evaluate the ages of the twins and triplets:

- Younger triplet: x
- Older triplet: x + 7
- Older twin: x + 14

The combined ages are 44, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x must be a whole number, we can try different values for x to find a solution that satisfies the equation. Let's try x = 7:

- Younger triplet: 7
- Older triplet: 7 + 7 = 14
- Older twin: 7 + 14 = 21

The combined ages are 7 + 14 + 21 = 42, which is less than 44. Let's try x = 8:

- Younger triplet: 8
- Older triplet: 8 + 7 = 15
- Older twin: 8 + 14 = 22

The combined ages are 8 + 15 + 22 = 45, which is greater than 44. Since x = 8 is too high, we can try x = 7.5:

- Younger triplet: 7.5
- Older triplet: 7.5 + 7 = 14.5
- Older twin: 7.5 + 14 = 21.5

The combined ages are 7.5 + 14.5 + 21.5 = 43.5, which is less than 44. Since x = 7.5 is too low, we can try x = 8:

- Younger triplet: 8
- Older triplet: 8 + 7 = 15
- Older twin: 8 + 14 = 22

The combined ages are 8 + 15 + 22 = 45, which is greater than 44. Since x = 8 is too high, we can try x = 7.5:

- Younger triplet: 7.5
- Older triplet: 7.5 + 7 = 14.5
- Older twin: 7.5 + 14 = 21.5

The combined ages are 7.5 + 14.5 + 21.5 = 43.5, which is less than 44. Since x = 7.5 is too low, we can try x = 7.66 (rounding up to the nearest hundredth):

- Younger triplet: 7.66
- Older triplet: 7.66 + 7 = 14.66
- Older twin: 7.66 + 14 = 21.66

The combined ages are 7.66 + 14.66 + 21.66 = 44, which is equal to 44.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21.66}$"
"To determine the time John has available for a nap, we must first convert the time before dinner into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate this as follows:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Next, we need to calculate the total time spent on homework. We can add the time for each subject:

20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes

Now, we can subtract the total homework time from the available time to find the time available for a nap:

180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes available for a nap."
"To determine the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the lollipops and the cost of the candies.

First, let's calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, we can multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10:

10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00

Next, we need to calculate the cost of 10 candies. We know that 4 candies cost $3.20, so we can find the cost of one candy by dividing the total cost by 4:

$3.20 ÷ 4 = $0.80

Now, we can multiply the cost of one candy by 10 to find the total cost of 10 candies:

10 candies * $0.80 = $8.00

Finally, we can add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:

$4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00

Therefore, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"To calculate the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to consider their monthly savings and the number of months in a year.

Rong saves 20 coins per month, while Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. This translates to Neil saving 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

The total number of months in 10 years is 10 * 12 = 120 months.

The total number of coins Rong saves in 10 years is 20 * 120 = 2400 coins.

The total number of coins Neil saves in 10 years is 28 * 120 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5760}$"
"To determine the total cost of the vaccines, we can calculate the cost of two vaccines as follows:

2 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's represent the total bill as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

0.6x = 40

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.6:

x = 40 / 0.6
x = 66.67

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:

Total cost = $40 (vaccines) + $66.67 (heartworm check)
Total cost = $106.67

To find out how much John leaves with, we subtract the total cost from the amount he brought with him:

Amount left = $125 - $106.67
Amount left = $18.33

The final answer is: $18.33"
"To determine the total cost of the crate, we can calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, so the cost of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.
The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so the cost of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Total cost of the crate: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

Therefore, the total cost of the crate is $32."
"To determine the total area of Brittany's comforter, we must first calculate the number of each color of squares and then sum them.

Let's denote the number of red squares as R, blue squares as B, green squares as G, and white squares as W. We are given the following information:

R = 14
B = R + 4
G = B + 6
W = G - 12

We can substitute the expressions for B and G into the equation for W:

W = (R + 4) + 6 - 12
W = R - 2

Now, we can substitute the value of R into the equation for W:

W = 14 - 2
W = 12

Now that we have the number of each color, we can calculate the total area of the comforter:

Total area = R + B + G + W
= 14 + (14 + 4) + (14 + 4 + 6) + 12
= 14 + 18 + 24 + 12
= 68

Therefore, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To determine the number of additional chairs Mia needs, we must first establish the total number of chairs required. The total number of attendees is 42 adults and 15 babies, which equals 57 individuals. 

Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

Number of regular chairs = 5 * Number of high chairs
= 5 * 8
= 40

Total number of chairs required = Number of high chairs + Number of regular chairs
= 8 + 40
= 48

As there are already 8 high chairs, the number of additional chairs needed is:

Additional chairs required = Total number of chairs required - Number of high chairs
= 48 - 8
= 40

Therefore, Mia needs 40 more chairs."
"To determine the number of 8-point bucks, we can apply the concept of percentages. Given that 50% of the deer are bucks, and 20% of those bucks possess 8 points, we can calculate the number of 8-point bucks as follows:

Number of 8-point bucks = Total deer * (Percentage of bucks * Percentage of 8-point bucks)
= 50 * (0.5 * 0.2)
= 50 * 0.1
= 5

Therefore, the correct answer is 5."
"To determine the total points collected by the students, we can break down the information provided:

Let's denote Adam's points as A, Betty's points as B, Marta's points as M, and Tom's points as T.

We know that A = 50.

Since Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, we can express this as B = A + 0.3A = 1.3A.

We also know that Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, and Tom has 30 points less than Betty. This can be expressed as T = B - 30 and M = 3T.

Substituting the value of B from the first equation, we get T = 1.3A - 30.

Now, we can express M in terms of A: M = 3(1.3A - 30) = 3.9A - 90.

Now, let's add up the points for all students: A + B + M + T = 50 + 1.3A + 3.9A - 90 + 1.3A - 30 = 6.3A - 70.

We know that the minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find the total points collected, we set up the equation: 6.3A - 70 = 400.

Solving for A, we get 6.3A = 470, and A ≈ 74.84.

Now, we can find the total points collected: 6.3A - 70 ≈ 6.3(74.84) - 70 ≈ 469.512.

The class is missing 400 - 469.512 ≈ 69.488 points.

The class is approximately 69.5 points short of the minimum threshold."
"The problem at hand involves a classic example of exponential growth, where the number of individuals in each generation is multiplied by 3. To calculate the total number of great grand-babies, we can employ the concept of exponential sequences.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children, resulting in 3^1 = 3 grandchildren.
2. Each of these 3 grandchildren has 3 children of their own, resulting in 3^2 = 9 great-grandchildren.
3. Each of these 9 great-grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, resulting in 3^3 = 27 great-great-grandchildren.

Therefore, the total number of great grand-babies is 3^3 = 27.

The correct answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the amount of money Greta has left after setting aside 50% for her retirement account and 20% for her car payment, we can calculate the amounts as follows:

Greta's original paycheck is $2400. 

First, we calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account: 50% of $2400 = 0.5 * $2400 = $1200.

Next, we calculate the amount she uses for her car payment: 20% of $2400 = 0.2 * $2400 = $480.

Now, we subtract the amounts she sets aside from her original paycheck: $2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720.

Therefore, Greta has $720 left to spend.

The final answer is: $720"
"To determine the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we can use the following calculation:

Let's denote the total capacity of the box as C and the number of missing pencils as M. We are given that C = 20 and M = 4.

The number of pencils in the box can be calculated as C - M = 20 - 4 = 16.

Since a pair of pencils consists of 2 pencils, we can find the number of pairs by dividing the total number of pencils by 2:

Number of pairs = (C - M) / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

Therefore, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we must consider the fireworks in the city and her backyard separately.

First, we calculate the total number of fireworks in the city. Since there are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, we can express this as a mathematical expression: 15 × 20.

15 × 20 = 300

Next, we need to find 40% of the total fireworks in the city. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4.

300 × 0.4 = 120

Now, we calculate the number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard. There are 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, which can be expressed as 3 × 5.

3 × 5 = 15

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks from the city and her backyard.

120 (city) + 15 (backyard) = 135

Therefore, Hannah will see a total of 135 fireworks.

The final answer is: 135"
"To calculate the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks, we can break down the problem into its constituent parts. 

First, we need to determine the total number of people, which is 12 (initial friends) + 7 (additional friends) = 19.

Each person consumes 2 drinks and 3 snacks, so the total number of drinks is 19 * 2 = 38, and the total number of snacks is 19 * 3 = 57.

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks is 38 * 2 = $76, and the total cost of snacks is 57 * 2 = $114.

The total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is $76 + $114 = $190.

The final answer is: $190"
"To determine the capacity of Gary's truck, we can start by establishing the capacity of each truck. Let's denote Gissela's truck capacity as G, Gordy's truck capacity as G + 800, and Gary's truck capacity as G + 800 + x, where x is the unknown capacity of Gary's truck.

We know that the total capacity of the three trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can set up the equation:

G + (G + 800) + (G + 800 + x) = 11,600

Combine like terms:

3G + 1,600 + x = 11,600

Subtract 1,600 from both sides:

3G + x = 10,000

We also know that G = 4,000. Substitute this value into the equation:

3(4,000) + x = 10,000

Multiply 3 by 4,000:

12,000 + x = 10,000

Subtract 12,000 from both sides:

x = -2,000

However, since a truck's capacity cannot be negative, we need to re-examine our initial assumption. Let's re-evaluate the equation:

G + (G + 800) + (G + 800 + x) = 11,600

Combine like terms:

3G + 1,600 + x = 11,600

Subtract 1,600 from both sides:

3G + x = 10,000

We know that G = 4,000. Substitute this value into the equation:

3(4,000) + x = 10,000

Multiply 3 by 4,000:

12,000 + x = 10,000

Subtract 12,000 from both sides:

x = -2,000

Since the capacity cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the initial setup. Let's re-examine the problem statement. We know that Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. So, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The total capacity of the three trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can set up the equation:

G + (G + 800) + (G + 800 + x) = 11,600

Combine like terms:

3G + 1,600 + x = 11,600

Subtract 1,600 from both sides:

3G + x = 10,000

We know that G = 4,000. Substitute this value into the equation:

3(4,000) + x = 10,000

Multiply 3 by 4,000:

12,000 + x = 10,000

"To determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the number of dumplings each female ate as 'x'. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, the number of dumplings each male ate can be represented as 'x + 1'.

We know that there are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6x. Similarly, there are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8(x + 1).

Since the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is equal to the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we can set up the equation:

6x + 8(x + 1) = total dumplings

We are also given that each female ate 3 dumplings, so we can substitute x = 3 into the equation:

6(3) + 8(3 + 1) = total dumplings
18 + 8(4) = total dumplings
18 + 32 = total dumplings
50 = total dumplings

Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is 50.

"To determine the amount of money Gerald has left, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of Gerald's share to Julia's share is 3:2, which adds up to a total of 5 parts. Since Gerald's initial amount is represented by 3 parts, we can calculate his share as follows:

Gerald's initial amount = (3/5) * 100
= 60

Now, we subtract the amount Gerald spent on the book from his initial amount to find the amount he has left:

Gerald's remaining amount = 60 - 10
= 50

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we can utilize the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time. Given that the turtle's speed is 1/5 that of the cat's, and the cat's speed is 15 feet/second, we can calculate the turtle's speed as follows:

Speed of the turtle = 1/5 * Speed of the cat
Speed of the turtle = 1/5 * 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying the speed of the turtle by the time:

Distance = Speed of the turtle * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To determine the number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we can use the concept of unit rates. The unit rate is the ratio of the amount raised to the time spent fundraising. In this case, the unit rate is $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour.

To find the total number of hours needed to raise $4200, we can divide the remaining amount by the unit rate:

$4200 ÷ $700 per hour = 6 hours

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal.

"To determine the percentage of the Colorado River's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to calculate the percentage of water used for industrial purposes. Given that the city uses 40% of the river's water and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes, we can express this as:

Industrial water usage = 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%

Now, to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial water usage from 100%:

Non-industrial water usage = 100% - 32% = 68%

Therefore, the city uses 68% of the Colorado River's total water for non-industrial purposes.

Final answer: $\boxed{68}$"

"To determine the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we can calculate the hourly production rates for each type of ice cream and then multiply these rates by the number of hours.

The chocolate ice cream factory produces 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its hourly rate is 100/2 = 50 quarts/hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory produces 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its hourly rate is 50/4 = 12.5 quarts/hour.

Now, we can calculate the total number of quarts made in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total quarts made in 48 hours: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

"To calculate the total bill, we need to apply the 10% discount to the total cost of the items.

First, we calculate the total cost of each item:

- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Total cost: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Now, we apply the 10% discount:
$50.00 x 0.10 = $5.00
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The total bill is $45.00."
"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should purchase, we can apply the concept of fractional analysis. Given that the deal is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free,"" we can consider the cost of 3 scoops as the cost of 2 scoops.

The cost of 3 scoops can be represented as 2 × $1.50 + $0 (since the third scoop is free). This simplifies to $3.00.

Now, we can divide Erin's budget of $6.00 by the cost of 3 scoops ($3.00) to find the maximum number of sets she can afford:

$6.00 ÷ $3.00 = 2

Since each set consists of 3 scoops, we can multiply the number of sets by 3 to find the total number of scoops:

2 sets × 3 scoops/set = 6 scoops

Therefore, Erin should purchase 6 scoops of ice cream.

Final answer: 6"
"To determine the amount of candy each individual has after two weeks, we can utilize the concept of linear decay. Given that Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy and consume 4 and 3 pieces per day, respectively, we can model their candy consumption using the formula:

C(t) = Initial Amount - (Daily Consumption * Number of Days)

For Ginger: C(t) = 100 - (4 * t)
For Amy: C(t) = 100 - (3 * t)

where t is the number of days.

We are interested in the amount of candy remaining after 14 days. Plugging in t = 14 into the respective equations, we get:

Ginger's candy: C(14) = 100 - (4 * 14) = 100 - 56 = 44
Amy's candy: C(14) = 100 - (3 * 14) = 100 - 42 = 58

To find the difference in their remaining candy, we subtract Ginger's amount from Amy's amount: 58 - 44 = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of mosaic tiles required to cover two thirds of a 36 square foot bathroom, we can employ the concept of proportional reasoning. 

First, we need to calculate two thirds of 36 square feet. This can be achieved by multiplying 36 by the fraction 2/3.

Let's express this calculation as a mathematical expression: (2/3) * 36

To simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator (2) by 36 and then divide the result by the denominator (3).

(2 * 36) / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24

Now that we have determined that two thirds of 36 square feet is equivalent to 24 square feet, we can proceed to calculate the number of mosaic tiles required. Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we can multiply the area to be covered (24 square feet) by the number of tiles required per square foot (24).

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

"To determine James' savings, we can calculate the cost of picking and buying blueberries separately and then find the difference.

The cost of picking blueberries is given by the equation: $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself.

The final answer is: $10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid for the computers, we need to first find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we can calculate the increase in price as follows:

Increase in price = 10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = Original price + Increase in price
= $700 + $70
= $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers:

Total amount = New price of each computer * Number of computers
= $770 * 500
= $385,000

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid for the computers is $385,000."

"To determine the difference in the number of boxes of cereal Castle bought this week and last week, we can employ a simple subtraction operation.

Let's denote the number of boxes of Coco Crunch as C and the number of boxes of Fruit Loops as F. We are given that Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch (C = 3) and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops (F = 5) this week. Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal, which we can represent as C_last = 4.

The difference in the number of boxes of cereal bought this week and last week can be calculated as:

Difference = (C + F) - C_last
= (3 + 5) - 4
= 8 - 4
= 4

Therefore, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the total number of taps Helga performs during her 5-minute dance, we can break down the problem into two distinct periods: when her arms are at her sides and when they are raised.

Let's denote the number of taps per minute for each foot as follows:
- Taps per minute with arms at sides: 550 (300 + 250)
- Taps per minute with arms raised: 400 (200 + 200)

Helga dances for 5 minutes in total, with her arms raised for 2 minutes. We can calculate the total number of taps for each period and then sum them up.

For the first 2 minutes with arms raised:
Total taps = 2 minutes * 400 taps/minute = 800 taps

For the remaining 3 minutes with arms at her sides:
Total taps = 3 minutes * 550 taps/minute = 1650 taps

The total number of taps Helga performs during the entire 5-minute dance is the sum of the taps from both periods:
Total taps = 800 + 1650 = 2450 taps

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the cost of the fine and the cost of the asphalt.

The cost of fixing the pothole can be calculated as the sum of the damage to the car ($450) and the additional costs incurred by Ron, which include the fine ($120) and the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt (3 * $25 = $75). Therefore, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $450 + $120 + $75 = $645.

The amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself can be found by subtracting the total cost of fixing the pothole from the cost of not fixing the pothole, which is $450.

The amount of money Ron saves = $645 (total cost of fixing the pothole) - $450 (cost of not fixing the pothole) = $195.

Therefore, Ron saves $195 by fixing the pothole himself."
"To determine the total number of chairs left, we must first calculate the initial total and then subtract the number of chairs sent for repair.

The initial total number of chairs is the sum of normal chairs and baby chairs: 170 + 23 = 193.

Next, we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair: 193 - (20 + 13).

Using the associative property of addition, we can rewrite the expression as: 193 - 20 - 13.

Now, we perform the subtractions: 193 - 20 = 173, then 173 - 13 = 160.

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the number of slices left, we can break down the problem into two parts: the slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends, and the slices eaten by the remaining two friends.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and each pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the total slices eaten as follows:

(2/3) × 12 = 8

Next, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by the remaining two friends. Since they ate ¾ of their pizzas, and each pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the total slices eaten as follows:

(3/4) × 12 = 9

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by both groups:

8 + 9 = 17

Since there were 5 pizzas in total, the number of slices left is:

5 × 12 - 17 = 25

Therefore, the number of slices left is 25."
"To calculate the average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we can employ the concept of weighted averages. 

Let's denote the time taken by the cat as C and the time taken by the dog as D. We are given that the dog takes 2/3 of the time the cat takes, so we can express this as:

D = (2/3)C

We also know that the cat takes 30 minutes, so C = 30. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

D = (2/3)(30)
D = 20

Now, we can calculate the average time taken by both the cat and the dog:

Average time = (C + D) / 2
= (30 + 20) / 2
= 50 / 2
= 25

Therefore, the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by converting the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to a single unit, inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, the length of Topher's shoe in inches is:

8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now, let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We are given that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be expressed as an equation:

9x + 10 = 100

To solve for x, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9 to isolate x:

x = 90 / 9
x = 10

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of windows smashed, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of windows smashed by students and the number of windows smashed by teachers.

Let's calculate the number of windows smashed by students and teachers separately.

Number of windows smashed by students:
Number of students' cars = 64
Number of windows per car = 4
Total windows smashed by students = 64 * 4 = 256

Number of windows smashed by teachers:
Number of teachers' cars = 32
Number of windows per car = 2
Total windows smashed by teachers = 32 * 2 = 64

Total windows smashed = 256 (students) + 64 (teachers) = 320

Therefore, the total number of windows smashed is 320."
"To determine the percentage of blue spools, we can use the formula:

Percentage = (Number of blue spools / Total number of spools) * 100

Given:
Number of light blue spools = 15
Number of dark blue spools = 45
Total number of light green spools = 40
Total number of dark green spools = 50

Total number of spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Number of blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, the percentage of blue spools is 40%."
"To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of people who voted by midday and the number of people who voted by 16:00.

First, we calculate the number of people who voted by midday, which is 2/5 of 5000:

(2/5) × 5000 = 2000

Next, we find the number of people remaining after midday:

5000 - 2000 = 3000

Then, we calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00, which is 2/3 of the remaining people:

(2/3) × 3000 = 2000

Finally, we subtract the number of people who voted by 16:00 from the total number of people remaining after midday to find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00:

3000 - 2000 = 1000

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need, we can use the following calculation:

Number of packs = Total days / Pieces of gum per day
= 30 days / 4 pieces of gum per day
= 30 / 4
= 7.5

Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a pack, we must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Parker has enough gum for the entire 30 days. Therefore, we will round 7.5 up to 8.

The correct answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers required, we must first calculate the total number of smores needed. This can be achieved by adding the number of smores for kids and adults.

Let's denote the number of kids as 'k' and the number of adults as 'a'. We are given that k = 9 and a = 6. The total number of smores needed is then:

Total smores = k * 2 + a * 1
Total smores = 9 * 2 + 6 * 1
Total smores = 18 + 6
Total smores = 24

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, we can divide the total number of smores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed:

Number of sleeves = Total smores / 8
Number of sleeves = 24 / 8
Number of sleeves = 3

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we can conclude that 3 boxes of graham crackers are required.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can utilize the given information to derive their individual ages and subsequently find the sum.

Given that Dora's age is 15 years, we can calculate her father's age by applying the relationship: father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8. Substituting Dora's age, we get:

father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
= 30

Next, we can determine Dora's mother's age by subtracting 4 years from her father's age:

mother's age = father's age - 4
= 30 - 4
= 26

Now, we can calculate the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their individual ages:

combined age = Dora's age + father's age + mother's age
= 15 + 30 + 26
= 71

The final answer is: $\boxed{71}$"
"To determine the amount of money each sibling received, we can utilize the concept of division. In this scenario, we have a total of $20 and 4 siblings. The division operation can be represented as:

$20 ÷ 4

This can be calculated as:

$20 ÷ 4 = $5

Therefore, each sibling received $5."
"To determine the total weight of Cindy's books, we can utilize the principle of additive weight. We have the following weights for each book:

- Math and science books: 2 pounds each, so 2 x 2 = 4 pounds
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: weighs twice as much as the English book, so 2 x 3 = 6 pounds

Now, let's add the weights together: 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds

Therefore, the total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds."
"To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we can start by calculating the number of votes candidate B received. Since candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A, we can calculate this as follows:

Candidate A's votes = 20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes

Candidate B's votes = 20 + (50% of 20) = 20 + 0.5 * 20 = 30 votes

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the total votes received by candidates A and B from the total number of voters:

Total votes = 100
Votes received by A and B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes

Votes received by C = Total votes - Votes received by A and B
= 100 - 50
= 50 votes

Therefore, candidate C received 50 votes."
"To determine the difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck after the transaction, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

Initially, Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. This can be expressed as:

Boris's apples = 100
Beck's apples = 100 - 23
Beck's apples = 77

When Boris gives Beck 10 apples, the new amounts are:

Boris's apples = 100 - 10
Boris's apples = 90

Beck's apples = 77 + 10
Beck's apples = 87

The difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck after the transaction is:

Difference = Boris's apples - Beck's apples
Difference = 90 - 87
Difference = 3

Therefore, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris after the transaction.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the amount of water left, we must first calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract it from the initial 32 ounces.

Let's break down the calculation:

Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Total water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
32 - 30 = 2 ounces

Therefore, Peter has 2 ounces of water left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of books Steven has as 'x'. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, we can express Clara's total as 2x.

We are given that Clara has 20 books, so we can set up the equation 2x = 20. Solving for x, we get x = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find Alice's total by adding 6 to Steven's total: 10 + 6 = 16.

To determine how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's total from Clara's total: 20 - 16 = 4.

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars, we need to first determine the cost of each type of jar.

The cost of a gallon jar is $5, and a half-gallon jar costs $2 less than a gallon jar. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar is $5 - $2 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5 = $50
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3 = $48

Total cost = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total cost = $50 + $48
Total cost = $98

The final answer is: $98"
"To determine the number of students who like to play video games, we can utilize the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

Let's denote the total number of students as N, the number of students who like to bake as B, the number of students who like to play basketball as K, the number of students who like to play video games as V, and the number of students who like to play music as M. We are given that N = 50, B = 10, and K = 5.

We are also given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, so M = 2K = 2 * 5 = 10.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can express the total number of students as the sum of the students who like each activity, minus the students who like both activities, plus the students who like neither activity. However, since we are only interested in the number of students who like video games, we can simplify the equation as follows:

N = B + K + V - (B ∩ V) + (B ∩ K) + (V ∩ K) + (B ∩ V ∩ K)

Since we don't have information about the intersections, we can assume that the students who like both video games and basketball, or video games and baking, or both, are negligible or not provided. Therefore, we can simplify the equation to:

N = B + K + V

Substituting the given values, we get:

50 = 10 + 5 + V

Solving for V, we get:

V = 50 - 10 - 5
V = 35

However, we know that the number of students who like music is 10, so the number of students who like video games or music is 35. Since the number of students who like music is 10, the number of students who like video games is 35 - 10 = 25.

The final answer is 25."
"To determine the total number of birds in the backyard, we can break down the problem into two steps.

First, we need to find the number of birds that were scared away. Since 1/3 of the initial 12 birds were scared away, we can calculate this as:

(1/3) × 12 = 12/3 = 4

Now, we subtract the number of birds scared away from the initial number of birds:

12 - 4 = 8

Next, we add the 20 birds that joined the backyard:

8 + 20 = 28

Therefore, the total number of birds in the backyard is 28.

The final answer is 28."
"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can employ a straightforward approach. Given that the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can calculate the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2.

Let's denote the number of students in each class as x. We can set up the equation:

2x = 80

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

Now that we know each class has 40 students, we can calculate the number of girls in each class by multiplying the total number of students in each class by the percentage of girls (40% or 0.4):

Number of girls in each class = 40 * 0.4
= 16

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

Number of boys in each class = 40 - 16
= 24

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of cake slices remaining on the plate, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

Initially, we have 2 slices of cake on the plate. Mara then adds 3 slices, resulting in a total of 2 + 3 = 5 slices. 

Next, she triples the number of slices, which can be expressed as 5 × 3 = 15 slices. 

After Mara eats 2 slices, the number of slices remaining is 15 - 2 = 13 slices.

Finally, her friend steals 5 slices, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 slices on the plate.

Therefore, the number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of animals Melissa will groom each day, we can utilize the concept of division. Given that there are a total of 28 animals (8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses) and a 7-day workweek, we can calculate the daily average as follows:

Total number of animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12
Total number of animals = 28

Daily average = Total number of animals / 7
Daily average = 28 / 7
Daily average = 4

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

Final Answer: The final answer is 4."
"To calculate the profit, we must first determine the total cost of the packs Mark purchased. Since he bought 3 packs at $1800 each, the total cost is:

3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400

Next, we calculate the total value of the cards Mark found. This includes the two cards worth $4000 and $1000, as well as the 30 cards worth $50 each. The total value of the 30 cards is:

30 cards * $50 per card = $1500

Now, we add the values of the two high-value cards to the total value of the 30 cards:

$4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

$6500 - $5400 = $1100

Therefore, Mark's profit is $1100."
"To determine the cost savings of choosing the second amusement park over the first, we can calculate the difference in total costs between the two options.

Let's denote the number of adults as A and the number of children as C. The cost for the first amusement park can be represented as 26A + 12C, and the cost for the second amusement park can be represented as 14A + 10C.

Given A = 2 and C = 2, we can substitute these values into the cost equations:

Cost of the first amusement park: 26A + 12C = 26(2) + 12(2) = 52 + 24 = 76
Cost of the second amusement park: 14A + 10C = 14(2) + 10(2) = 28 + 20 = 48

The cost savings can be calculated as the difference between the two costs:
Cost savings = (Cost of the first amusement park) - (Cost of the second amusement park)
= 76 - 48
= 28

Therefore, the family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To determine the daily savings, we can calculate the difference in cost between the old vendor and the new vendor.

The cost of purchasing 500 tomatoes from the old vendor is 500 * $0.5 = $250 per day.
The cost of purchasing 500 tomatoes from the new vendor is 500 * $0.4 = $200 per day.

The daily savings can be calculated as the difference between the two costs: $250 - $200 = $50 per day.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350 per week.

Therefore, the vendor saves $350 per week by switching to the new vendor."
"To solve this problem, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the number of marbles each individual has. 

Let's denote the number of marbles Sean has as S, the number of marbles Carl has as C, and the number of marbles Cal has as K. 

We are given that Sean has 56 marbles, so S = 56. 

We are also given that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so S = K/2. Substituting S = 56, we get 56 = K/2, which implies K = 112.

Additionally, we are given that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so C = 4S. Substituting S = 56, we get C = 4 * 56 = 224.

Now, we can find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined by adding their marbles together: C + K = 224 + 112 = 336.

The final answer is: $\boxed{336}$"
"To determine the number of groups needed, we must first clarify the correct requirement. The problem states that 54 students are to be separated into six groups, but the activity actually requires 12 groups. This discrepancy suggests that the initial statement may be incorrect, and we should focus on the actual requirement.

Given that 54 students are to be divided into 12 groups, we can calculate the number of students per group as follows:

54 ÷ 12 = 4.5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, this indicates that the initial requirement of 12 groups is not feasible with 54 students. However, if we assume the activity indeed requires 12 groups, we can proceed with the calculation.

In this case, the number of groups needed to form 54 students into 12 groups is not a matter of finding additional groups, but rather verifying the initial requirement. The question's phrasing suggests that 12 groups are already required, which seems to be the case.

Therefore, the answer to the question, as it is posed, is that no additional groups are needed, as the initial requirement of 12 groups is already met.

Final answer: $\boxed{0}$"
"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent in two 4-week months, we need to consider the rental patterns for weekdays and weekends separately.

Let's break it down:

- Number of weekdays in 4 weeks: 5 weekdays/week * 4 weeks = 20 weekdays
- Number of weekend days in 4 weeks: 2 weekend days/week * 4 weeks = 8 weekend days

Given that 60 chairs are rented each weekday and 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, we can calculate the total number of chairs rented in 4 weeks as follows:

Total chairs rented in 4 weeks = (60 chairs/day * 20 days) + (100 chairs/day * 8 days)
Total chairs rented in 4 weeks = 1200 + 800
Total chairs rented in 4 weeks = 2000

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out 2000 chairs in two 4-week months.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To determine the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile, we can analyze the sequence of events:

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas. Arnold stole half of them, leaving Gunther with 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Next, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, resulting in a total of 24 + 25 = 49 bananas. However, Arnold then stole 12 bananas, reducing the total to 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

Finally, Gunther added 6 bananas to his pile, yielding a final count of 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43.

The correct answer is: $\boxed{43}$"
"To determine the yearly electricity bill per roommate, we can utilize the concept of proportional sharing. Given that the monthly electricity bill is $100 and there are 4 roommates, we can calculate the monthly share per roommate as follows:

Monthly share per roommate = Total monthly bill / Number of roommates
Monthly share per roommate = $100 / 4
Monthly share per roommate = $25

To find the yearly share, we multiply the monthly share by 12:

Yearly share per roommate = Monthly share per roommate * 12
Yearly share per roommate = $25 * 12
Yearly share per roommate = $300

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity, assuming the monthly bill remains constant and the roommates divide the share equally."
"To determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we must consider the initial quantities and the number of items that were damaged during the event.

The initial quantities are as follows:

- Glasses: 8 dozen = 8 × 12 = 96
- Plates: 4 dozen = 4 × 12 = 48

The number of damaged items is:
- Glasses: 10
- Plates: 6

To find the total number of remaining items, we subtract the damaged items from the initial quantities:

Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86
Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42

The total number of remaining items is the sum of the remaining glasses and plates:
Total remaining = 86 + 42 = 128

The final answer is: 128"
"To determine the total number of buttons Lorraine has at the end of the trading process, we need to calculate the number of buttons she receives from each trade and then sum them up.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
This can be represented as 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers traded for large buttons. 
Since each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, the number of large buttons she receives is 27 / 3 = 9.

She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
This can be represented as 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers traded for large buttons. 
Since each large button is worth 3 small stickers, the number of small buttons she receives is 20 * 3 = 60.

She now has 3 small stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers.
She has 20 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

The final answer is 83."
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in a week, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we establish the number of matches played on each day: 
- Monday: 2 matches
- Friday: 1 match
- Saturday: 2 times the number of matches played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches

Now, we add the number of matches played on each day to find the total:
Total matches = 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"In this scenario, we're dealing with a simple algebraic equation. The problem states that the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it. Let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as x. The total number of council members is 33, so the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33.

We can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combining like terms, we get 3x = 33

Dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 11

Now, we can determine the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2: 2x = 2(11) = 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

Final answer: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total number of shirts ordered, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the number of students for each size.

Let's denote the number of students for each size as follows:
- Extra-small: x
- Small: 2x
- Medium: 2x - 4
- Large: (2x - 4) / 2
- Extra-large: ((2x - 4) / 2) + 6

We know that the total number of students is the sum of students for each size. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + (2x - 4) + ((2x - 4) / 2) + (((2x - 4) / 2) + 6) = total

To simplify the equation, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions and combine like terms:

x + 2x + 2x - 4 + (2x - 4) / 2 + (2x - 4) / 2 + 6 = total

Combine like terms:

5x - 4 + (2x - 4) = total

Simplify further:

7x - 8 = total

Now, we can substitute the given value for x (11) into the equation:

7(11) - 8 = total

77 - 8 = total

69 = total

The final answer is: 69"
"To calculate the final price after a 5% discount, we can use the following formula:

Final Price = Marked Price - (Marked Price * Discount Percentage)

In this case, the marked price is $140 and the discount percentage is 5%.

Final Price = 140 - (140 * 0.05)
Final Price = 140 - 7
Final Price = 133

Therefore, the final price after the discount is $133."
"To calculate the total number of hours the playlists will last, we can employ the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

First, we multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist to obtain the total number of songs: 20 playlists * 300 songs/playlist = 6000 songs.

Next, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song to determine the total hours: 6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60,000 hours.

Therefore, the 20 playlists will last for 60,000 hours in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60,000}$"
"To determine the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win, which is 20% of 50 people. This can be expressed as 0.20 * 50.

Let's calculate this value: 0.20 * 50 = 10.

Next, we need to find the number of people who think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. We then calculate 60% of 40, which can be expressed as 0.60 * 40.

Let's calculate this value: 0.60 * 40 = 24.

Now, we can find the number of people who think horse #12 will win by subtracting the number of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total number of people. This can be expressed as 50 - (10 + 24).

Let's calculate this value: 50 - (10 + 24) = 50 - 34 = 16.

Therefore, 16 people think horse #12 will win."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward approach using algebra. Let's denote the total number of puppies as 'x'. We know that two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and one-third of those Pomeranians are girls. We're given that there are 6 Pomeranian girls.

We can set up the equation: (1/3) * (2/3) * x = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get: (2/9) * x = 6

To isolate x, we multiply both sides by 9/2, resulting in: x = 6 * (9/2)

x = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies.

The final answer is 27."
"To determine how much Jayden needs to buy the camera, we can calculate the total amount of money he has after receiving the contribution from his sister Ava. 

First, we need to find half of Ava's $90 allowance, which is $45. Then, we add this amount to Jayden's initial $70:

$70 + $45 = $115

Now, we subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera, $200, to find out how much more he needs:

$200 - $115 = $85

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

Final Answer: The final answer is $85."
"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, we can break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, we know that the total number of cases required for all three houses is 250. 

Let's denote the number of cases needed for the first house as x. Since the second house needs half of the first house's amount, the second house requires x/2 cases. 

The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so it requires 2x cases.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of cases: x + x/2 + 2x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2x + x + 4x = 500.

Combining like terms, we get 7x = 500.

Dividing both sides by 7, we find that x = 500/7, which is approximately 71.43.

Since the third house needs double the amount of the first house, it requires 2x = 2 * 71.43 = 142.86 cases.

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the third house needs approximately 143 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{143}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the items purchased, we can apply basic arithmetic operations.

Leila's expenditure on cucumbers can be calculated as 3 × $2 = $6.
Jack's expenditure on tomatoes can be calculated as 5 × $1 = $5.
Chase's expenditure on lettuce can be calculated as $3.

The total expenditure is the sum of these individual expenditures: $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

Therefore, the total amount spent by the three individuals is $14."
"To determine the total number of fruits, we can use the given information that George has 45% more pears than bananas. Let's denote the number of bananas as B and the number of pears as P. We are given that B = 200.

We can express the relationship between the number of bananas and pears as:

P = B + 0.45B
P = 1.45B

Substituting B = 200, we get:

P = 1.45 * 200
P = 290

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of bananas and pears:

Total Fruits = B + P
Total Fruits = 200 + 290
Total Fruits = 490

Therefore, George has a total of 490 fruits."
"To determine the number of candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of candy bars as 'x'. Since each candy bar costs $5, the total cost of the candy bars can be represented as 5x.

We know that Marissa had $80 initially and spent $20 on the ball, leaving her with $60. This remaining amount was used to purchase the candy bars. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

5x = 60

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 60 ÷ 5
x = 12

Thus, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total cost of making 4 liters of juice, we can utilize the concept of direct proportionality. Since Sam requires 5 kilograms of oranges for 1 liter of juice, we can establish a ratio of oranges to liters as 5 kg : 1 L. 

To find the cost of 4 liters of juice, we can multiply the cost of 1 kilogram of oranges by the number of kilograms required for 4 liters of juice. The cost of 1 kilogram of oranges is $3, so the cost of 20 kilograms (5 kg/L * 4 L) is 20 * $3 = $60.

Therefore, the total cost of making 4 liters of juice is $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the total number of books read, we can employ a straightforward approach. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. We are given that Ezra read 300 books in one hour and then decided to read 150 more. To find the total number of books Ezra read, we can calculate:

Total books read by Ezra = Initial books read + Additional books read
Total books read by Ezra = 300 + 150
Total books read by Ezra = 450

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can set up the equation:

Total books read by Ezra = 2 * Total books read by Ahmed

Substituting the value of Total books read by Ezra, we get:

450 = 2 * Total books read by Ahmed

To find the total number of books read by Ahmed, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Total books read by Ahmed = 450 / 2
Total books read by Ahmed = 225

Now, we can find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed by adding their individual totals:

Total books read = Total books read by Ezra + Total books read by Ahmed
Total books read = 450 + 225
Total books read = 675

The final answer is: $\boxed{675}$"
"To calculate Tanya's total earnings, we need to consider her hourly wage and the additional daily bonus for teaching more than 3 classes.

First, let's calculate her earnings for Monday. She teaches 4 classes for 5 hours, earning $15 per hour. Her total earnings for Monday can be calculated as:

4 classes * 5 hours * $15 per hour = $60

Since she teaches more than 3 classes on Monday, she also earns an additional $5 per day. Therefore, her total earnings for Monday are:

$60 + $5 = $65

Next, let's calculate her earnings for Wednesday. She teaches 2 classes for 2 hours, earning $15 per hour. Her total earnings for Wednesday can be calculated as:

2 classes * 2 hours * $15 per hour = $30

Since she teaches more than 3 classes on Wednesday, she also earns an additional $5 per day. Therefore, her total earnings for Wednesday are:

$30 + $5 = $35

Now, we can find Tanya's total earnings for the two days by adding her earnings for Monday and Wednesday:

$65 + $35 = $100

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach.

Let's calculate the total number of each type of scent sold:

Vanilla scents sold: 5 * 4 = 20
Fruity scents sold: 2 * 8 = 16

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
20 - 16 = 4

Therefore, the company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to the fruity scents.

Final answer: 4"
"To determine the selling price of each ear of corn, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the selling price of each ear of corn as x.

The total revenue from selling eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60. The total revenue from selling corn is 25x. Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we can set up the equation:

60 + 25x = 135

Subtracting 60 from both sides gives us:

25x = 75

Dividing both sides by 25:

x = 75/25
x = 3

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

Final answer: $3"
"To determine the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we must first calculate the total time devoted to non-soccer activities. 

Time spent reading = 3 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * (12 - 3) = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Total time devoted to non-soccer activities = Time spent reading + Time spent playing video games
Total time devoted to non-soccer activities = 3 + 3 = 6 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total weekend time - Total time devoted to non-soccer activities
Time spent playing soccer = 12 - 6 = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer is 50%."
"To determine the number of pencils Anthony kept, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the number of pencils Anthony gave to Brandon. Since he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, we can calculate this as:

Number of pencils given to Brandon = (1/2) × Total pencils
= (1/2) × 50
= 25

Now, we subtract the pencils given to Brandon from the total to find the remaining pencils:

Remaining pencils = Total pencils - Pencils given to Brandon
= 50 - 25
= 25

Next, we need to find 3/5 of the remaining pencils, which Anthony gave to Charlie. We can calculate this as:

Number of pencils given to Charlie = (3/5) × Remaining pencils
= (3/5) × 25
= 15

Finally, we subtract the pencils given to Charlie from the remaining pencils to find the number of pencils Anthony kept:

Number of pencils kept = Remaining pencils - Pencils given to Charlie
= 25 - 15
= 10

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we must consider the time spent driving to and from the museum, as well as the time spent at the museum itself.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack's speed is 75 miles per hour. We can calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum using the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home, we must double the time:

Total driving time = 2 hours * 2
Total driving time = 4 hours

Adding the time spent at the museum (6 hours), we get:

Total time gone from home = Total driving time + Time spent at the museum
Total time gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time gone from home = 10 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours."
"To determine the number of wheels left in the box, we must first calculate the total number of wheels required for the assembly of the toys.

The number of wheels needed for the cars can be calculated as 57 cars * 4 wheels per car, which equals 228 wheels. Similarly, the number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle, resulting in 146 wheels.

The total number of wheels needed is the sum of the wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles, which is 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.

Now, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the initial number of wheels in the box: 650 - 374 = 276 wheels.

Therefore, the number of wheels left in the box is 276.

The final answer is: $\boxed{276}$"
"To calculate the discounted price of the laptop, we can use the formula for percentage decrease:

Discounted Price = Original Price - (Original Price * Discount Percentage)

In this case, the original price is $1000 and the discount percentage is 20%.

Discounted Price = $1000 - ($1000 * 0.20)
= $1000 - $200
= $800

Therefore, the amount you have to pay is $800."
"To calculate the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we can break down the problem into manageable components.

First, we need to determine the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

The cost of the series can be found by multiplying the number of movies in series by the cost savings, which is $6 per movie. This gives us:

Cost of series = Number of movies in series * $6
= 200 * $6
= $1200

Next, we need to find the number of remaining movies that are not in series. We can do this by subtracting the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate the number of older movies as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of remaining movies * 0.4
= 400 * 0.4
= 160

The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so we can calculate the total cost of the older movies:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * $5
= 160 * $5
= $800

Now, we need to find the cost of the normal movies. Since there are 400 remaining movies and 160 of them are older movies, the number of normal movies is:

Number of normal movies = Number of remaining movies - Number of older movies
= 400 - 160
= 240

The cost of the normal movies is $10 each, so we can calculate the total cost of the normal movies:

Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * $10
= 240 * $10
= $2400

Finally, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies by adding the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies:

Total cost = Cost of series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= $1200 + $800 + $2400
= $4400

The final answer is: $4400"
"To calculate the total cost of the fruit, we can apply the principle of weighted averages. 

Let's break down the cost of each type of fruit:

- Peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
- Plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
- Apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

The total cost can be calculated by adding these values together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

Therefore, the total cost of the fruit is $38.00."
"To determine the distance to the vacation spot, we can employ the concept of relative motion. Let's break down the problem into two parts: the driving distance and the hiking distance.

The Llesis family drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour for 6 hours. We can calculate the driving distance using the formula:

Driving Distance = Speed × Time
Driving Distance = 50 miles/hour × 6 hours
Driving Distance = 300 miles

Now, we are given that the family hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of the driving speed is 25 miles per hour, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 20 miles per hour. We know the time spent hiking is 1.5 hours. We can use the formula:

Hiking Distance = Speed × Time
Hiking Distance = 20 miles/hour × 1.5 hours
Hiking Distance = 30 miles

Since the driving and hiking distances are independent, we can find the total distance to the vacation spot by adding the driving distance and the hiking distance:

Total Distance = Driving Distance + Hiking Distance
Total Distance = 300 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 330 miles

Therefore, the distance to their vacation spot is 330 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{330}$"
"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's denote Emma's score as E and Ava's score as A. We know that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so Ava's enemy points are 10 times the number of enemies she jumps on, which is 10(8 + x), where x is the number of enemies Emma jumps on. Emma collects 3 fewer berries than Ava, so her berry points are 5 times the number of berries she collects, which is 5(8 - x). Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so her time bonus is 30 times the difference in seconds, which is 30(4).

We can set up the equation:

A = 10(8 + x) + 5(8 - x) + 30(4)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

A = 80 + 10x + 40 - 5x + 120

Combine like terms:

A = 240 + 5x

Now, we know that Emma's score is 820. We can set up an equation using this information:

E = 820

Substitute E into the equation:

820 = 240 + 5x

Subtract 240 from both sides:

580 = 5x

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 116

Now that we know x, we can find Ava's score:

A = 240 + 5(116)
A = 240 + 580
A = 820

Since Ava and Emma have the same score, the difference between their scores is 0.

The final answer is: 0"
"To determine the cost of the remaining two pizzas, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of each of the remaining two pizzas as 'x'. Since the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, and two of them cost 30 dollars, we can set up the following equation:

2x + 30 = 64

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation yields:

2x = 34

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 17

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas costs 17 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the usual days and the extra days.

Let's denote the number of times they ride on usual days as 'x'. Since they ride 3 times a day for 5 days, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the other two days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is 2x. Since there are 2 such days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 2x * 2 = 4x.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is the sum of the times on usual days and the extra days: 15 + 4x.

However, we are not given the value of 'x'. To find the total number of times they ride their bikes, we need more information. But if we assume 'x' is a constant, we can express the total number of times they ride their bikes as 15 + 4x.

Since we are not given the value of 'x', we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, if we assume 'x' is a constant, we can express the total number of times they ride their bikes as 15 + 4x.

But, since the question asks for a numerical answer, we can assume 'x' is a constant and calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes for a specific value of 'x'. Let's assume 'x' is 3 (i.e., they ride 3 times a day on usual days). Then, the total number of times they ride their bikes is 15 + 4(3) = 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. He took out 14 orange fish and 3 white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he took out as x. Since the total number of white fish he took out is 3, we can set up the equation:

x = 3

Now, let's calculate the total number of white fish Bob has after taking out x white fish:

Total white fish = Initial white fish - x
= 4 - 3
= 1

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

Number of orange fish = 2 * Number of white fish
= 2 * 1
= 2

However, we know that Bob took out 14 orange fish initially, so the number of orange fish he has now is:

Number of orange fish = Initial orange fish - 14
= 3 - 14
= -11

This is not possible, as the number of fish cannot be negative. Therefore, our initial assumption that x = 3 is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the situation. Since Bob took out 14 orange fish, the number of orange fish he has now is -11. This means that the number of orange fish he took out is 14 + 11 = 25. However, this is not possible, as the total number of orange fish initially was 3.

"To determine the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car, we must first calculate the total distance traveled in a week. Since Andy commutes to work from Monday to Friday, the number of working days is 5. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles per day.

Total distance traveled in a week = 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles

Next, we can calculate the amount of gas consumed per week by dividing the total distance traveled by the fuel efficiency of the car, which is 10 miles per gallon.

Gas consumed per week = Total distance traveled / Fuel efficiency
= 50 miles / 10 MPG
= 5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of gas consumed per week by multiplying the gas consumed per week by the price per gallon, which is $3.

Cost of gas consumed per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
= 5 gallons * $3/gallon
= $15

Therefore, the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car is $15."
"To calculate the total amount Carrie paid for lunch, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the amount she spent on twenties and the amount she spent on quarters.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on twenties. Carrie had 10 twenties and spent 3/5 of them. To find 3/5 of 10, we can multiply 10 by 3/5:

(3/5) × 10 = (3 × 10) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6

So, she spent 6 twenties, which is equivalent to 6 × $20 = $120.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on quarters. Carrie had 140 quarters and spent all of them. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we can multiply 140 by 0.25:

140 × 0.25 = 35

Now, let's add the amounts she spent on twenties and quarters to find the total amount she paid for lunch:

$120 + $35 = $155

The final answer is: $155"
"To determine the total number of fruits, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total number of tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes.

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants: 8 plants * 4 eggplants/plant = 32 eggplants.

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the overall total: 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

Therefore, Ricardo can expect to obtain 142 fruits from his plants."
"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we can utilize the concept of complementary fractions. Since one-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs, we can find the combined fraction of non-OLED TVs by adding these two fractions.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 4 and 8 is 8. We can rewrite one-fourth as 2/8.

Now, we can add the fractions: 2/8 (smart TVs) + 1/8 (analog TVs) = 3/8 (non-OLED TVs).

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, we can multiply the fraction of non-OLED TVs by the total number of TVs to find the number of non-OLED TVs: 3/8 * 40 = 15.

To find the number of OLED TVs, we subtract the number of non-OLED TVs from the total number of TVs: 40 - 15 = 25.

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the amount of money John is missing, we can calculate the difference between the total cost of the trip and the amount he has. 

The total cost of the trip is $300, and John has $50. To find the amount he is missing, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost:

$300 - $50 = $250

Therefore, John is missing $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn, we must first calculate the temperature difference between the day and night. This can be found by subtracting the nighttime temperature from the daytime temperature:

Temperature difference = Daytime temperature - Nighttime temperature
Temperature difference = 45 - 33
Temperature difference = 12 degrees

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can divide the temperature difference by the heating capacity of one log to find the required number of logs:

Number of logs = Temperature difference / Heating capacity per log
Number of logs = 12 / 5
Number of logs = 2.4

Since we cannot burn a fraction of a log, we must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the house is warm enough. Therefore, Carson needs to burn at least 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

Final answer: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total number of seashells collected, we first need to calculate the number of groups that participated. Given that 90 people were divided into 9-person groups, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we can calculate the number of groups that contributed as:

Number of contributing groups = 3/5 * Number of groups
= 3/5 * 10
= 6

As each group brought back 2 seashells, the total number of seashells collected is:

Total seashells = Number of contributing groups * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2
= 12

Therefore, the total number of seashells collected is 12."
"To determine the number of people on the train after the sequence of events, we can apply basic arithmetic operations.

Initially, there are 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people get off, resulting in 172 - 47 = 125. Then, 13 more people get on, increasing the total to 125 + 13 = 138. Finally, at the next stop, 38 people get off, leaving 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, the number of people on the train is 100.

100"
"To calculate the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we can utilize the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

The problem involves a straightforward multiplication of the number of bottle caps collected per day by the number of days in the month, and then multiplying the result by the value of each bottle cap. This can be expressed as:

Total amount of money = (Number of bottle caps per day) * (Number of days in the month) * (Value of each bottle cap)

Plugging in the given values, we get:

Total amount of money = 10 * 30 * $0.25

Using the associative property of multiplication, we can rearrange the expression to simplify the calculation:

Total amount of money = (10 * $0.25) * 30

First, we multiply 10 by $0.25:

10 * $0.25 = $2.50

Now, we multiply the result by 30:

$2.50 * 30 = $75

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month.

The final answer is: $75"
"To calculate Jamie's total earnings for the day, we can break down her work into two segments: the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours. Her hourly rate is $20, so her total earnings for these hours are:

8 hours × $20/hour = $160

For the additional 3 hours, her special hourly rate is 150% of her regular rate, which can be calculated as:

$20 × 1.5 = $30 per hour

Her total earnings for these additional hours are:

3 hours × $30/hour = $90

Now, we can find her total earnings for the day by adding the earnings from both segments:

$160 + $90 = $250

Therefore, Jamie's total earnings for the day are $250."
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the number of male lions, which is half the number of female lions. Since there are 12 female lions, we can express this as:

Number of male lions = 12 / 2 = 6

Next, we add the number of male lions, female lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions:

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To calculate the amount of money Mike will have left over after purchasing the discounted jeans, we can apply the concept of percentage discount to the original price of the jeans.

The original price of the jeans is $40, and the discount is 25%. To find the amount of the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (as a decimal):

$40 x 0.25 = $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price:

$40 - $10 = $30

Since Mike pays with a $50 bill, we can find the amount of change by subtracting the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over.

The final answer is: $20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. The initial number of employees is 200, and the company hires 20 new employees every month. This represents an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 20.

The total number of employees after three months can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

S = n/2 * (a1 + an)

where S is the sum of the series, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, the first term (a1) is 200, and the last term (an) is 200 + (20 * 3) = 220. The number of terms (n) is 3 + 1 = 4 (since we're including the initial 200 employees).

S = 4/2 * (200 + 220)
S = 2 * 420
S = 840

However, this represents the total number of employees, not the total salary paid. To find the total salary paid, we multiply the total number of employees by the salary per employee:

Total salary paid = 840 * $4000
Total salary paid = $3,360,000

The final answer is: $3,360,000"
"To determine the total caroling time, we can utilize the concept of multiplication and addition. 

The choir plans to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice, which is equivalent to 2 x 150 seconds. This can be calculated as 2 * 150 = 300 seconds.

Additionally, they will sing ""Jingle Bells"" once, which is a fixed duration of 240 seconds.

To find the total caroling time, we can add the time for each song: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

Therefore, the total caroling time is 540 seconds.

Final answer: 540"
"To calculate the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally, we need to determine their hourly wages and then multiply by the number of hours worked.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After a $0.50 increase, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. Following another $1.00 increase, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's initial wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 

Since both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, we can calculate their total earnings as follows:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings:

$230 - $210 = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the cost difference between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we can apply basic arithmetic operations.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 times the cost of one loaf, which is $2. Therefore, the total cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 × $2 = $6.

Similarly, the cost of 2 bagels is 2 times the cost of one bagel, which is $1. Therefore, the total cost of 2 bagels is 2 × $1 = $2.

Now, we can find the difference in cost by subtracting the cost of 2 bagels from the cost of 3 loaves of bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the total score of Pierson and Nikita, we need to calculate Nikita's score first. Since Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, we can express this as:

Nikita's score = (Pierson's score / 2) + 11

Given Pierson's score is 278, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Nikita's score = (278 / 2) + 11
Nikita's score = 139 + 11
Nikita's score = 150

Now, let's add their scores together:

Total score = Pierson's score + Nikita's score
Total score = 278 + 150
Total score = 428

Therefore, the total score of Pierson and Nikita is 428.

The final answer is: $\boxed{428}$"
"To calculate the total number of trees planted, we can break down the problem into two components: the number of trees planted by students and the number of trees planted by teachers.

Let's start by calculating the number of trees planted by students. With 40 classes and an average of 25 students per class, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000. Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by students is also 1000.

Next, we calculate the number of trees planted by teachers. With 40 classes and 3 teachers per class, the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120. Since each teacher plants two trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is the sum of the trees planted by students and teachers, which is 1000 + 240 = 1240.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1240}$"
"To determine the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be the sum of the current number of stuffed animals (3 + 5 + 2 + 4) and the number of stuffed goats (x). We can express this as:

Total Stuffed Animals = 14 + x

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up the equation:

(Stuffed Goats / Total Stuffed Animals) = 0.3

Substituting the expression for Total Stuffed Animals, we get:

(x / (14 + x)) = 0.3

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides gives:

0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7 gives:

x = 4.2 / 0.7
x = 6

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the number of hours Kris needs to play to earn the achievement, we can break down her gaming time into two segments: the initial 2 weeks and the subsequent week.

First, let's calculate the total hours played in the first 2 weeks. Since Kris plays for 0.5 hours per day, we can multiply the daily hours by the number of days: 0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 hours.

Next, we'll calculate the total hours played in the last week. Kris plays for 2 hours per day, so we multiply the daily hours by the number of days: 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

Now, we add the hours played in both segments to find the total hours played: 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. Since she has already played 21 hours, we subtract the total hours played from the required hours: 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours.

Therefore, Kris needs to play 9 more hours to earn the achievement.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we can apply the concept of relative motion. Since the second car is traveling at a higher speed, it will cover more ground in the same time frame. 

Let's denote the distance traveled by the first car as d1 and the distance traveled by the second car as d2. We know that d1 = 60t and d2 = 70t, where t is the time in hours.

Since the second car passes the first car, the distance between them after 2 hours is the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars: d2 - d1 = 70t - 60t = 10t.

Given that t = 2 hours, we can substitute this value into the equation to find the distance between the two cars: 10t = 10(2) = 20 miles.

Therefore, the distance between the two cars after 2 hours is 20 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the ring, we need to determine the cost of the premium and add it to the total cost of the diamond and gold.

The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900. The premium is 30% of this total cost. To find 30% of $900, we can multiply $900 by 0.3.

$900 * 0.3 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the ring.

$900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To determine the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Let's break down the information:

- Third-graders who passed: 340
- Fourth-graders who passed: 40
- Fifth-graders who passed: 2 * 40 = 80 (since their pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders)

Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460
Total students in the school: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100
= 46%

Therefore, the overall pass rate is 46%."
"To determine the length of the mosaic, we must first calculate the total area that can be covered by the available glass chips. Since it takes 12 chips to create one square inch, we can find the total area by multiplying the number of chips by the number of chips per square inch.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'b', the number of chips per bag as 'c', and the number of chips per square inch as 's'. We are given that b = 2 and c = 72.

Total chips = b * c = 2 * 72 = 144

Now, we can find the total area that can be covered by these chips:

Total area = Total chips / chips per square inch = 144 / 12 = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height:

Length = Total area / Height = 12 / 3 = 4 inches

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the initial amount of tea, we must first calculate the total amount consumed. Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, resulting in a total of 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts. Additionally, 16 students drank 2 quarts each, totaling 16 x 2 = 32 quarts. The combined total is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the initial amount of tea was 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts). Therefore, the initial amount of tea in gallons is 48 ÷ 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of candies Dale still needs to sell, we can use a simple subtraction operation. 

Let's denote the initial number of candies as x. We know that Dale started with x = 100 candies. He then sold 150 candies, leaving him with x - 150 candies. After that, he ordered 100 more candies, bringing the total to x + 100 candies.

Since we want to find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to set up an equation to represent the situation. Let y be the number of candies Dale still needs to sell. We can write the equation as:

x + 100 - (x - 150) = y

Simplifying the equation, we get:

100 + 150 - x = y
250 - x = y

We know that x = 100, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

250 - 100 = y
150 = y

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 150 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To calculate the number of additional students who joined the campus by the end of May, we can utilize the concept of exponential growth. Given that the student population doubles at the end of every month, we can model this situation using the formula for exponential growth:

A = P(2^n)

where:
A = final population
P = initial population (10 students)
n = number of months

We want to find the population at the end of May, which is 5 months after the initial population. Plugging in the values, we get:

A = 10(2^5)
A = 10(32)
A = 320

To find the additional students, we subtract the initial population from the final population:

Additional students = Final population - Initial population
= 320 - 10
= 310

Therefore, the number of additional students who joined the campus by the end of May is 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we can utilize the concept of division. Given that Felix made $105 and charges $0.25 per branch, we can calculate the total number of branches as follows:

Total branches = Total money / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since Felix worked for 7 days, we can then divide the total branches by 7 to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

Therefore, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."
"To determine the total number of petals in the vase, we can employ the concept of combinatorics and basic arithmetic operations.

Rose initially picked a total of 3 flowers with 5 petals each, 4 flowers with 6 petals each, 5 flowers with 4 petals each, and 6 flowers with 7 petals each. We can calculate the total number of petals by multiplying the number of flowers by their respective petal counts and then summing the results.

Total petals = (3 * 5) + (4 * 6) + (5 * 4) + (6 * 7)
Total petals = 15 + 24 + 20 + 42
Total petals = 101

However, Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, so we need to subtract the total number of petals she dropped from the total number of petals picked. The total number of petals dropped is 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22.

Total petals in the vase = Total petals picked - Total petals dropped
Total petals in the vase = 101 - 22
Total petals in the vase = 79

Therefore, the total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have, we need to consider the total number of marshmallows available and the number of S'mores already made.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Total number of marshmallows = 35
2. Number of marshmallows dropped = 3
3. Remaining marshmallows = 35 - 3 = 32

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, the total number of S'mores that can be made with the remaining marshmallows is equal to the number of remaining marshmallows:

Total S'mores = 32

We know that John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so the total number of S'mores already made is 9 + 9 = 18.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to subtract the number of S'mores already made from the total number of S'mores that can be made:

Remaining S'mores for John = 32 - 9 = 23
Remaining S'mores for DeSean = 32 - 9 = 23

Since both kids have the same number of remaining S'mores, they can each have an equal number of S'mores.

Final answer: 23"
"To calculate the total amount of money used, we can break down the problem into individual components.

Let's denote the cost per game for Jack as C. Since his friends play for half the time, their cost per game is 0.5C. The better friend plays for 1.5 times as long, so their cost per game is 1.5C.

We know that the total time played is 4 hours, which is equivalent to 240 minutes. Let's express the time played by each friend in terms of C:

- Jack plays for 240 minutes, so the number of games he plays is 240 / 20 = 12 games.
- The two friends who play for half the time play for 120 minutes each, so the number of games they play is 120 / 20 = 6 games each.
- The better friend plays for 360 minutes, so the number of games they play is 360 / 20 = 18 games.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total cost:

12C + 2(0.5C) + 18(1.5C) = Total Cost

Combine like terms:

12C + C + 9C = Total Cost
22C = Total Cost

Since we know the total time played is 4 hours, we can also express the total cost as:

Total Cost = (4 hours * 4 quarters/hour) = 16 quarters

Now, we can equate the two expressions for Total Cost:

22C = 16 quarters
C = 16 quarters / 22
C = 0.7273 quarters per game (approximately)

Now that we have the cost per game, we can calculate the total amount of money used:

Total Cost = 12 games * 0.7273 quarters/game ≈ 8.7276 quarters
Total Cost ≈ 2.1824 dollars

The final answer is: $2.18"
"To determine the amount of oil used in the salt scrub, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount of salt as 's', the amount of citrus zest as 'z', the amount of fragrance as 'f', and the amount of oil as 'o'. We are given the following relationships:

1. s = z (since the amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance)
2. s = 2z (since the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest)
3. o = 2s (since the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt)

We can use substitution to solve for 'o'. From equation (2), we have s = 2z. Substituting this into equation (3), we get:

o = 2(2z)
o = 4z

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, we can set up the equation:

s + z + f + o = 10

Substituting s = z and o = 4z, we get:

z + z + z + 4z = 10

Combine like terms:

7z = 10

Divide both sides by 7:

z = 10/7

Now that we know z, we can find o:

o = 4z
o = 4(10/7)
o = 40/7
o = 5.71 (approximately)

Rounded to two decimal places, the amount of oil used is approximately 5.71 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5.71}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money John spent, we can utilize the concept of multiplication and addition. 

First, we'll find the total cost of the goats by multiplying the number of goats by the cost per goat: 3 * $500 = $1500.

Next, we'll find the total cost of the cows by multiplying the number of cows by the cost per cow: 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we'll add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall expenditure: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, John spent a total of $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine the number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

Let's calculate the difference between the total number of cupcakes required and the number of cupcakes Paul already possesses.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already has = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already has
= 63 - 48
= 15

Therefore, Paul needs to acquire 15 more cupcakes to meet the required quantity."
"To determine the number of cars Joe has after selling and giving some to his mother, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to calculate the number of cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, we can express this as:

Joe's initial cars = 2 * Robert's cars
Joe's initial cars = 2 * 20
Joe's initial cars = 40

Next, we calculate the number of cars Joe sells. 20% of his cars are sold, which can be expressed as:

Number of cars sold = 0.2 * Joe's initial cars
Number of cars sold = 0.2 * 40
Number of cars sold = 8

After selling 8 cars, Joe is left with:

Joe's remaining cars = Joe's initial cars - Number of cars sold
Joe's remaining cars = 40 - 8
Joe's remaining cars = 32

Finally, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Joe's final remaining cars = Joe's remaining cars - Number of cars given away
Joe's final remaining cars = 32 - 16
Joe's final remaining cars = 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount each student raised, we can employ a straightforward division operation. 

The charity raised a total of $175,000, with $50,000 coming from organizations. Therefore, the remaining amount, $125,000, was raised by the students. Since there are 20 students, we can calculate the amount each student raised by dividing the total student contribution by the number of students.

Amount each student raised = Total student contribution ÷ Number of students
= $125,000 ÷ 20
= $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic progression. The time she walked on the first day is 8 hours, and the time she walked on the second day is half of that, which is 4 hours.

The total time can be calculated by adding the time walked on both days: 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we can multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). Therefore, the total time in minutes is 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{720}$"
"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

Initially, the parking lot had 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, increasing the total to 50 + 20 = 70 cars. 

When Hunter exited the classroom for lunch, half of the cars had departed, leaving 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars in the parking lot. 

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To calculate John's weekly earnings, we can employ the fundamental principles of arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to determine the total number of tasks completed in a week. Since John completes 30 cycles of work per day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total number of cycles as follows:

Total cycles per week = 30 cycles/day * 7 days/week = 210 cycles/week

Each cycle consists of 5 tasks, so the total number of tasks completed in a week is:

Total tasks per week = 210 cycles/week * 5 tasks/cycle = 1050 tasks/week

Given that each task pays $1.20, we can calculate John's weekly earnings as follows:

Weekly earnings = Total tasks per week * Payment per task
= 1050 tasks/week * $1.20/task
= $1260/week

Therefore, John's weekly earnings are $1260."
"To determine Sasha's total points, we can break down the information into two separate equations based on the given conditions.

Let's denote Sasha's points in the first game as S1 and Julie's points in the first game as J1. We know that Sasha scored 14 points in the first game, so S1 = 14.

We also know that Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so J1 = S1 - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Therefore, Sasha's points in the second game, S2, can be expressed as S2 = J1 - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4.

Now, we can calculate Sasha's total points by adding the points from both games: Total = S1 + S2 = 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we can use the following calculation:

Let's denote the number of packages of cat food as C and the number of packages of dog food as D. We are given that C = 8 and D = 6.

The total number of tins of cat food is 11C, and the total number of tins of dog food is 6D. To find the difference, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food:

Difference = 11C - 6D
= 11(8) - 6(6)
= 88 - 36
= 52

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of cards each individual has. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x.

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick's card count can be represented as 3x. Becca, having 12 more cards than Smendrick, can be represented as 3x + 12.

The total number of cards is given as 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides yields:

7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7 results in:

x = 47

Now that we have found PJ's card count, we can determine Becca's card count by substituting x into the equation 3x + 12:

Becca's card count = 3(47) + 12
= 141 + 12
= 153

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{153}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of green eggs as G, blue eggs as B, pink eggs as P, and yellow eggs as Y.

We are given the following information:

1. G = 5
2. B = 2G
3. P = B - 1
4. Y = P/3

We can substitute the values of B and P in terms of G into the equation for Y:

Y = (B - 1)/3
Y = ((2G - 1)/3)

Now, we can express the total number of eggs as the sum of the individual types:

Total = G + B + P + Y
Total = G + 2G + (2G - 1) + (2G - 1)/3

Combine like terms and simplify:

Total = 7G - 2/3

Substitute the value of G:

Total = 7(5) - 2/3
Total = 35 - 2/3
Total = 33 2/3

Therefore, Cindy had 35 2/3 eggs altogether.

The final answer is: 35 2/3"
"To determine the amount Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping and the refund amount.

The cost of shipping can be calculated using the formula: Cost = (Weight * Rate per pound) + (Distance * Rate per mile)
Cost = (4 pounds * $0.35 per pound) + (20 miles * $0.08 per mile)
Cost = $1.40 + $1.60
Cost = $3.00

The refund amount is 75% of the purchase price:
Refund amount = 0.75 * $32
Refund amount = $24

Since Milly will have to pay the shipping cost, we subtract the refund amount from the purchase price:
Amount Milly will lose = Purchase price - Refund amount - Shipping cost
Amount Milly will lose = $32 - $24 - $3
Amount Milly will lose = $5

The final answer is: $5"
"To calculate the amount of money Mulan has left, we need to consider the initial amount she had, the amount given by her father, and the total amount she spent.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initial amount: $40
2. Amount given by her father: $100
3. Total amount: $40 + $100 = $140

Mulan then buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of the jeans is 2 * $30 = $60. Additionally, she buys a bag for $20. The total amount she spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

To find the amount of money Mulan has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

Therefore, Mulan has $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the production for the fourth week, we can utilize the information provided to calculate the weekly production pattern. 

Let's denote the production for the first week as W1, the second week as W2, and the third week as W3. We are given the following information:

W1 = 8,000
W2 = W1 / 2
W3 = 3 * W1

We can express W2 and W3 in terms of W1:
W2 = 8,000 / 2 = 4,000
W3 = 3 * 8,000 = 24,000

The total production for the first three weeks is the sum of W1, W2, and W3:
Total = W1 + W2 + W3 = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000

Since the total monthly production is 50,000, we can find the production for the fourth week by subtracting the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production:
Production for the fourth week = Total monthly production - Total production for the first three weeks
= 50,000 - 36,000
= 14,000

The final answer is: $\boxed{14,000}$"
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to consider the time she dedicates to creating content and preparing for her videos.

First, let's calculate the total time she spends writing songs and doing makeup in a month. 

Time spent writing songs: 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours
Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week. Converting 90 minutes to hours: 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours/week
Total time spent on content creation and preparation per week: 8 hours + 1.5 hours = 9.5 hours/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the weekly time by 4 to get the total time spent on TikTok in a month: 9.5 hours/week * 4 weeks = 38 hours.

Therefore, Britany spends 38 hours on TikTok in a month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{38}$"
"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the items into standard and additional items. The standard items are: 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of these standard items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. We need to calculate the number of additional items:

- Mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 extra mirrors
- Chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 extra chandelier
- Pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 extra pictures

The cost of the additional items is calculated as follows:

- 2 extra mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
- 1 extra chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
- 10 extra pictures * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost for Angela is the sum of the standard items and the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To determine Roy's savings, we can break down the information provided. Let's denote Roy's savings as R, Anthony's savings as A, and Eva's savings as E.

We are given that Eva has saved $20.00, so E = $20.00.

We also know that Anthony has saved $10 more than Eva, so A = E + $10 = $20 + $10 = $30.

Furthermore, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we can calculate 0.4A = 0.4($30) = $12.

Now, we can find Roy's savings by adding 40% of Anthony's savings to Anthony's savings: R = A + 0.4A = $30 + $12 = $42.

Therefore, Roy has $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the height Naruto can lift, we can analyze the given information using a step-by-step approach.

First, we establish the relative lifting capacities of each individual:

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"To calculate the total distance traveled by Mason, we can apply the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time. In this scenario, we have two segments of travel with different durations.

Let's break it down:

1. Distance traveled in the first 4 hours: 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
2. Distance traveled in the next 6 hours: 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

To find the total distance, we add the distances traveled in both segments:

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ the concept of relative motion and proportionality. Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as 'k' and the speed of a turtle as 't'. We are given that the speed of a turtle is half the speed of a kangaroo, so t = k/2.

We know that 3 kangaroos can cover the distance in 18 hours, so the total distance covered by 3 kangaroos is 3k * 18. Since the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can set up the equation:

3k * 18 = 4t * x

where 'x' is the time taken by 4 turtles to cover the same distance.

Substituting t = k/2 into the equation, we get:

3k * 18 = 4(k/2) * x
3k * 18 = 2k * x
54k = 2kx
x = 54k / 2k
x = 27

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we can utilize the given information to establish a system of linear equations.

Let's denote the number of dishes Kora made as K, the number of dishes Rory made as R, and the number of dishes Jada made as J. We are given the following information:

1. K = 20
2. R = K + 20
3. J = 2R

We can substitute the value of K into equation (2) to find the value of R:
R = 20 + 20
R = 40

Next, we can substitute the value of R into equation (3) to find the value of J:
J = 2(40)
J = 80

Now, we can calculate the total number of dishes made by adding the values of K, R, and J:
Total = K + R + J
Total = 20 + 40 + 80
Total = 140

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora is 140."
"To determine the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of money she has in her purse as x.

The total cost of the laptop after trading in her old one is $400. She has been paid $150 for her part-time job and received $80 from her mom. The amount she still needs to buy the laptop is $50. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 230 = 350

Now, let's solve for x:

x = 350 - 230

x = 120

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"To determine the number of apple slices left, we must first calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples separately.

The number of slices from 3 large apples is 3 x 5 = 15.
The number of slices from 5 small apples is 5 x 3 = 15.

The total number of slices is the sum of these two values: 15 + 15 = 30.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of cows required to produce 25 liters of milk per day, we can use a simple proportion. 

Let's denote the number of cows needed as 'x'. Since the farmer currently has 3 cows, each producing 5 liters of milk per day, we can set up the following proportion:

5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 25 liters

To find the number of cows needed, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 25 liters / 5 liters/cow
x = 5 cows

However, this calculation assumes that the milk production rate remains constant. In reality, milk production can vary depending on factors such as the cow's breed, age, and health. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this calculation, we can proceed with the assumption that the milk production rate remains constant.

The farmer needs 5 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

Final answer: 5"
"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used and add them together.

Let's analyze each glue stick individually:

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 5/6 by the original length of 12 mm:
(5/6) * 12 = 10 mm

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/3 by the original length of 12 mm:
(1/3) * 12 = 4 mm

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/2 by the original length of 12 mm:
(1/2) * 12 = 6 mm

Now, we add the lengths of the used parts together:
10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 mm."
"To determine the amount Gabriel still needs, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the items: $10,000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10,800.

Next, we calculate the total amount Gabriel has: $5,000 (from working) + $200 (from his brother) = $5,200.

Now, we subtract the amount Gabriel has from the total cost: $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600.

Final answer: $5600"
"To calculate the change, we can use the following formula:

Change = Amount Given - Price of Hat

Given that Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, the total amount she gave is:

Amount Given = 4 x $20 = $80

Now, subtract the price of the hat ($70) from the total amount she gave:

Change = $80 - $70
Change = $10

Therefore, Thea received $10 in change."
"To determine Craig's remaining funds, we must first calculate the total amount spent. Craig initially possesses $40, comprised of two twenty-dollar bills. He then acquires six squirt guns at $2 each, resulting in a total expenditure of 6 × $2 = $12. Additionally, he purchases three packs of water balloons at $3 each, leading to an additional expenditure of 3 × $3 = $9.

The total amount spent is the sum of these expenditures: $12 + $9 = $21.

To find Craig's remaining funds, we subtract the total amount spent from his initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Therefore, Craig has $19 left.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of socks and dishes each individual has.

Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as S and the number of dishes Jack has as D. We are given that Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so we can write an equation:

D = 2S

We are also given that Jack collected 60 dishes, so we can substitute 60 for D in the equation:

60 = 2S

To solve for S, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

S = 60/2
S = 30

Now that we know Jack has 30 socks, we can find the number of socks Peter has, which is twice the number of socks Jack has:

P = 2S
P = 2(30)
P = 60

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can confirm that Peter also has 60 socks.

To find the total number of socks they have together, we can add the number of socks each individual has:

Total Socks = S + P
Total Socks = 30 + 60
Total Socks = 90

We are also given that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so we can find the number of dishes Peter has by dividing the number of dishes Jack has by 2:

D_P = D/2
D_P = 60/2
D_P = 30

To find the total number of dishes they have together, we can add the number of dishes each individual has:

Total Dishes = D + D_P
Total Dishes = 60 + 30
Total Dishes = 90

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 (socks) + 90 (dishes) = 180.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To determine the number of students good at math, we can utilize the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's denote the total number of students as T, the number of students good at math only as M, the number of students good at English only as E, and the number of students good at both math and English as B.

Given:
T = 20
M = 5
E = 8

We are tasked with finding the value of M + B, which represents the total number of students good at math.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can express the total number of students as:

T = M + E + B

Rearranging the equation to solve for B, we get:

B = T - M - E
= 20 - 5 - 8
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English:

M + B = 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to consider the total available time and the time required for each group's performance.

The total time available for the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. Each group's performance consists of 10 minutes (2 minutes for getting on stage, 6 minutes for performing, and 2 minutes for exiting the stage). Additionally, a 10-minute intermission is allowed.

To find the total time required for each group, we can add the time for the intermission to the time for the performance: 10 minutes (performance) + 10 minutes (intermission) = 20 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total available time by the total time required for each group to determine the number of groups that can perform:

Number of groups = Total available time / Total time required for each group
= 120 minutes / 20 minutes
= 6

Therefore, Vicki can accommodate 6 groups in the concert.

Final answer: 6"
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we can utilize the formula for simple interest:

A = P(1 + rt)

where:
A = total amount
P = principal amount ($300)
r = annual interest rate (3/4 or 0.75)
t = time in years (3)

First, we'll calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

Year 1: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225, Total = P + Interest = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225, Total = $525 + $225 = $750
Year 3: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225, Total = $750 + $225 = $975

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975."
"To determine the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars, we can break down the information as follows:

Let's denote the total number of white shirts as W and the total number of floral shirts as F. We are given that W = 40 and F = 50.

We also know that half of the white shirts have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is W/2 = 40/2 = 20. Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is W - W/2 = 40 - 20 = 20.

Similarly, we are given that 20 floral shirts have buttons, so the number of floral shirts with no buttons is F - 20 = 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars:

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the total earnings, we can use the formula:

Total Earnings = Number of Trays * Price per Tray

Given:
Number of Eggs = 900
Eggs per Tray = 30
Price per Tray = $2.5

First, we calculate the number of trays:
Number of Trays = Total Eggs / Eggs per Tray
= 900 / 30
= 30 trays

Now, we can find the total earnings:
Total Earnings = Number of Trays * Price per Tray
= 30 trays * $2.5
= $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To determine the total number of goats left in the two farms, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

Let's denote the initial number of goats in Farm X as x and the initial number of goats in Farm Y as y. We are given that x = 55 and y = 45.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is x - 10. He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm Y is y - 20.

Now, we can calculate the total number of goats left in both farms by adding the number of goats left in each farm:
Total goats left = (x - 10) + (y - 20)
= (55 - 10) + (45 - 20)
= 45 + 25
= 70

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."
"To determine the average cost of each pair of shoes, we can utilize the formula for average value, which is the total value divided by the number of items. In this scenario, the total value is $2640, and the number of items (pairs of shoes) is 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

Average cost per pair = Total amount spent per year / Number of pairs bought per year
= $2640 / 12
= $220

Therefore, James pays an average of $220 for each pair of shoes."
"To calculate the total cost, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the green food and the cost of the red food with the discount.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 times the cost of one basket, which is $25. Therefore, the total cost of the green food is:

3 × $25 = $75

For the red food, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets first, which is 3 × $18 = $54. Since we get $2 off for each basket of red food, we subtract $6 from the total cost:

$54 - $6 = $48

Now, we add the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food:

$75 + $48 = $123

Therefore, the total cost is $123."
"To determine the time required to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to find the number of rooms that is one-half of 90, which is 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we can calculate the total time required by multiplying the number of rooms by the time per room:

Time = Number of rooms * Time per room
Time = 45 rooms * 20 minutes/room
Time = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we can divide the total minutes by 60:

Time (hours) = 900 minutes / 60
Time (hours) = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

Final answer: $\boxed{15}$"
"To calculate the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break down the problem into three parts.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

Therefore, the total number of homes built over the next three years is 144.

The final answer is: $\boxed{144}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote your age as 'x'. Since you are 3 years younger than your brother, your brother's age is x + 3. You are 2 years older than your sister, so your sister's age is x - 2. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, which is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of your ages is 87, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:

5x + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides:

5x = 78

Divide by 5:

x = 15.6

However, since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Let's re-evaluate the equation to ensure accuracy.

5x + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides:

5x = 78

Divide by 5:

x = 15.6

Let's denote the number of packs as 'p'. Since each pack contains 8 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs is 2 times the number of students (2 * 27 = 54). 

Now, we can set up the equation: 8p ≥ 54, where 'p' represents the number of packs. To find the minimum number of packs required, we can divide both sides of the inequality by 8:

p ≥ 54 ÷ 8
p ≥ 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the minimum number of packs he needs to buy is 7.

The correct answer is: D"
"To calculate the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day, we can follow a straightforward approach.

Let's denote the initial amount of water as x. On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. On the second day, it doubles, so the amount becomes 2x. On the third day, it increases by 6000 gallons, making the total amount 2x + 6000.

We are given that the initial amount of water is 4000 gallons, so we can substitute x = 4000 into the equation: 2(4000) + 6000.

Simplifying the expression, we get 8000 + 6000 = 14000.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

Final answer: 14000"
"The problem at hand is a classic example of exponential growth, where the number of infected individuals grows by a fixed factor each day. In this scenario, we have an initial population of 10 individuals, and each infected person infects 6 others, resulting in a daily growth rate of 6.

To calculate the total number of infected individuals after three days, we can utilize the formula for exponential growth:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where:
A = total number of infected individuals after n days
P = initial population (10)
r = daily growth rate (6/10 or 0.6, since each person infects 6 others)
n = number of days (3)

Plugging in the values, we get:

A = 10(1 + 0.6)^3
A = 10(1.6)^3
A = 10 * 4.096
A = 40.96

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we can approximate the total number of infected individuals after three days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{41}$"
"To calculate the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we can use the concept of percentages. 

First, we need to find 10% of Rafaela's tips, which is $800. To find 10% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.10. So, 10% of $800 is 0.10 * $800 = $80.

Since Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela, we subtract $80 from Rafaela's total tips to find Julieta's total tips. Julieta's tips = $800 - $80 = $720.

Now, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips to find the total amount of tips received by both. Total tips = $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To determine the number of oranges Jennifer remained with, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of oranges given away: 3 daughters received 2 oranges each, so 3 x 2 = 6 oranges were distributed among the daughters. Additionally, Jennifer's son received 3 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, we subtract the total oranges given away from the initial number of oranges purchased: 12 - 9 = 3.

Therefore, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To determine the number of badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we can analyze their badge-earning rates.

Claire's badge-earning rate is 1 badge per month, which translates to 12 badges per year. 

Amber's badge-earning rate is half of Claire's, as she takes twice as long to earn a badge. Therefore, Amber's badge-earning rate is 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges per year.

Wendy's badge-earning rate is three times Claire's, which is 3 * 12 = 36 badges per year.

To find the difference in badge earnings between Wendy and Amber, we subtract Amber's badge-earning rate from Wendy's: 36 - 6 = 30 badges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To calculate the total amount raised, we can employ the concept of unitary method. Paige baked 10 loaves of banana bread, with each loaf yielding 8 slices. The total number of slices is then 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Since each slice is sold for $0.50, we can multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice to determine the total amount raised: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

Therefore, Paige raised a total of $40 in the fundraiser.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total number of coins Gretchen had, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. We are given that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

Solving for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

Now that we have found the number of silver coins, we can calculate the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = x + (x + 30)
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

Therefore, Gretchen had a total of 110 coins."
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to find the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student received 10 burritos, the total number of burritos distributed is 50 * 10 = 500.

Next, we subtract the number of burritos consumed by Mr. George, which is 20, from the total number of burritos distributed. This yields 500 - 20 = 480.

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos is 480.

The final answer is 480."
"To determine the number of yellow cars, we can start by establishing the number of green cars, which is 2 fewer than the number of red cars. 

Let's denote the number of red cars as R. Then, the number of green cars is R - 2.

We are given that the number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars can be expressed as 3(R - 2).

The total number of cars is the sum of the red, green, and blue cars, which is given as 75. We can set up the equation:

R + (R - 2) + 3(R - 2) = 75

Combine like terms:

R + R - 2 + 3R - 6 = 75

Combine like terms:

5R - 8 = 75

Add 8 to both sides:

5R = 83

Divide both sides by 5:

R = 16.6

Since the number of cars must be a whole number, we can round R to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can use the exact value of R to find the number of yellow cars.

The number of green cars is R - 2 = 16.6 - 2 = 14.6. However, we can't have a fraction of a car, so we'll use the rounded value of R to find the number of green cars. 

R = 17 (rounding R to the nearest whole number)

The number of green cars is R - 2 = 17 - 2 = 15

The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars = 3 * 15 = 45

Now, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

Number of yellow cars = 75 - (12 + 15 + 45)
= 75 - 72
= 3

The final answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of books each person has. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as x, Anne has as y, and Sofie has as z.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of books is 85: x + y + z = 85
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne: z = y + 25
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn: y = x - 12

We can substitute the expression for y from equation (3) into equation (2) to get:

z = (x - 12) + 25
z = x + 13

Now, we can substitute the expressions for y and z into equation (1):

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To determine the weight of the carrots, we can utilize the given information to establish a system of linear equations. Let's denote the weight of the potatoes as P, the weight of the sweet potatoes as S, and the weight of the carrots as C.

We are given that the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, so P = 5.

We are also given that the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, so S = 2P = 2(5) = 10.

Lastly, we are given that the carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so C = S - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.

Therefore, the weight of the carrots is 7 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total cost of the jello, we need to calculate the number of boxes required and then multiply it by the price per box.

First, we calculate the total number of cups needed: 30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups.

Since each box yields 10 cups, we divide the total cups needed by 10 to find the number of boxes required: 120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes.

Now, we multiply the number of boxes needed by the price per box to find the total cost: 12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15.

Therefore, the total cost of the jello is $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To calculate the change, we need to subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given. 

The total cost of the phones is $700 per phone multiplied by the number of phones, which is 5. 

Total cost = 5 * $700
Total cost = $3500

The amount given is $4000. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount given:

Change = $4000 - $3500
Change = $500

Therefore, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To determine Keenan's weekly expenditure, we must first calculate his monthly expenditure. Given that Madeline and Keenan share the cost of groceries, which amounts to $400 per month, and Madeline pays 60% of the cost, we can calculate Keenan's monthly expenditure as follows:

Keenan's monthly expenditure = Total monthly expenditure - Madeline's monthly expenditure
= $400 - (60% of $400)
= $400 - 0.6 × $400
= $400 - $240
= $160

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can now calculate Keenan's weekly expenditure by dividing his monthly expenditure by 4:

Keenan's weekly expenditure = $160 ÷ 4
= $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

The final answer is $40."
"To determine the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces he ate on the first day. Since he consumed 2/5 of the total 60 pieces, we can express this as a fraction:

(2/5) × 60 = 24

Next, we'll subtract the pieces he ate on the first day from the total to find the remaining pieces:

60 - 24 = 36

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces, leaving him with:

36 - 10 = 26

Now, we'll calculate the number of pieces he ate on the third day. He consumed 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces:

(7/13) × 26 = 14.3076923077 (round down to 14, as we can't eat a fraction of a piece)

Finally, we'll add up the pieces he ate each day:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Therefore, Tobias has eaten a total of 48 pizza pieces.

Final answer: 48"
"To determine the total cost of the items David wants to purchase, we can break down the calculation into two parts: the cost of the soda and the cost of the water.

The cost of 3 bottles of soda can be calculated as 3 times the cost of one bottle, which is $21.00. Therefore, the total cost of the soda is 3 × $21.00 = $63.00.

Similarly, the cost of 2 bottles of water can be calculated as 2 times the cost of one bottle, which is $8.00. Therefore, the total cost of the water is 2 × $8.00 = $16.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the soda and the cost of the water: $63.00 + $16.00 = $79.00.

The final answer is: $79.00"
"To determine the amount of money David has left after purchasing the bolts, we can employ the concept of subtraction. 

The total cost of the bolts can be calculated by multiplying the number of bolts by the cost per bolt:

Cost = Number of bolts × Cost per bolt
= 16 × $0.03
= $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money David has:

Remaining amount = Initial amount - Total cost
= $12.48 - $0.48
= $12.00

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To determine Ella's hourly rate, we can divide her total earnings by the number of hours she worked. 

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Total hours
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

To find Ella's earnings after 12 hours, we can multiply her hourly rate by the total hours she will work.

Total earnings = Hourly rate * Total hours
Total earnings = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Total earnings = $132

Therefore, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking.

The final answer is: $132"
"To determine the number of marbles Paul has left, we can follow a step-by-step approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after receiving 28 marbles from his friend. This can be done by adding 28 to the initial 52 marbles: 52 + 28 = 80.

Next, we need to find 1/4 of the total number of marbles Paul has. To do this, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is equivalent to 80 * 0.25 = 20.

Now, we subtract the number of marbles Paul lost (20) from the total number of marbles he had after receiving the additional marbles (80): 80 - 20 = 60.

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To calculate Amy's total score, we can break down the problem into three components: multiple-choice questions, true/false questions, and long-answer questions.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Since there are 10 questions and each is worth 1 point, we can calculate the total points as follows:

10 questions * 1 point per question = 10 points

Next, we'll calculate the points from the true/false questions. There are 20 questions, and each is worth 1 point. We can calculate the total points as follows:

20 questions * 1 point per question = 20 points

Now, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. There are 5 questions, and each is worth 5 points. We can calculate the total points as follows:

5 questions * 5 points per question = 25 points

To find Amy's total score, we can add the points from each type of question:

10 points (multiple-choice) + 20 points (true/false) + 25 points (long-answer) = 55 points

The final answer is 55."
"To determine the cost price of the chickens, we can use the formula for calculating the cost price based on the selling price and desired profit.

Let's denote the cost price as 'x'. Since Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens at $50 each, the total revenue from selling these chickens is:

(3/5) * 300 * 50 = 900

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, so we can set up the equation:

900 = x + 2000

To solve for x, we subtract 2000 from both sides:

x = 900 - 2000
x = -1100

However, the cost price cannot be negative, as it represents the amount Isaias spent on the chickens. This indicates that the initial assumption of selling 3/5 of the chickens at $50 each may not be feasible to achieve a profit of $2000.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, he needs to sell the chickens at a higher price. Let's denote the selling price as 'y'. The total revenue from selling all 300 chickens would be:

300y

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can set up the equation:

300y = x + 2000

We know that Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of the chickens at the higher price 'y'. The revenue from selling these chickens is:

(3/5) * 300 * y = 180y

The revenue from selling the remaining 2/5 of the chickens at the original price of $50 is:

(2/5) * 300 * 50 = 600

The total revenue is the sum of these two revenues:

300y = 180y + 600

Simplifying the equation:

120y = 600

Dividing both sides by 120:

y = 5

Now that we know the selling price 'y', we can find the cost price 'x':

300y = x + 2000
300(5) = x + 2000
1500 = x + 2000

Subtracting 2000 from both sides:

x = -500

(3/5) * 300 * y = 180y

The revenue from selling the remaining 2/5 of the chickens at the original price of $50 is:

(2/5) * 300 * 50 = 600

The total revenue is the sum of these two revenues:

300y = 180y + 600

Simplifying the equation:

120y = 600

Dividing both sides by 120:

y = 5

Now that we know the selling price 'y', we can find the cost price 'x':

300y = x + 2000
300(5) = x + 2000
1500 = x + 2000

Subtracting 2000 from both sides:

x = -500

However, the cost price cannot be negative. This indicates that the initial assumption of selling 3/5 of the chickens at $50 each and the desired profit of $2000 may not be feasible.

Let's re-evaluate the problem again. If Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, he needs to sell the chickens at a higher price. Let's denote the selling price as 'y'. The total revenue from selling all 300 chickens would be:

"To determine the number of glasses Julie sold more than Micah, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of glasses Micah sold as x. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the boys sold an equal number of glasses, we can write the equation:

x + x + 14 = 32

Combine like terms:

2x + 14 = 32

Subtract 14 from both sides:

2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 9

Now that we know Micah sold 9 glasses, we can find the difference between Julie's sales and Micah's sales:

14 (Julie) - 9 (Micah) = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we can break down the costs of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which can be expressed as:

$400 × (1/4) = $400 × 0.25 = $100

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which can be expressed as:

$100 × (3/4) = $100 × 0.75 = $75

Now, let's add the costs together:

$400 + $100 + $75 = $575

Therefore, the total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To determine the amount of money Sarah will have left over after purchasing the new rope, we can calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The cost of the new rope is the product of its length and the cost per meter, which is 20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30.

Sarah's initial amount of money is the product of the rope's length and the cost per meter, which is 20 meters * $2/meter = $40.

Now, we can find the amount of money left over by subtracting the cost of the new rope from Sarah's initial amount:
$40 - $30 = $10

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

The final answer is: $10"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation to represent Melanie's age in the future. Let's denote her present age as 'x'. Since she will be 18 in 10 years, we can write the equation:

x + 10 = 18

Solving for x, we get:

x = 18 - 10
x = 8

Now, we need to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age. This can be represented as:

3x = ?

Substituting the value of x, we get:

3(8) = 24

Since we want to find the number of years, we subtract her present age from 24:

24 - 8 = 16

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

- The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
- The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 x 2 = $12.
- The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 x $4 = $12.
- The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 x $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$10 + $12 + $12 + $14 = $48

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
$65 - $48 = $17

Therefore, Kelly has $17 left in her budget."
"To determine the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the runtime of her usual concerts as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can express the runtime of the final concert as 2x. Additionally, we know that the final concert includes a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert can be represented as 2x + 15.

Given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we'll first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

Thus, the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the number of toys Argo has now, we can utilize the principle of subtraction. The initial number of toys Argo had is 200. He then distributed 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 to Bonnie, and 30 to Nicky. To find the total number of toys given away, we can add these amounts together: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150.

Now, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50.

Therefore, Argo has 50 toys now."
"To determine the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays and Wednesdays: 125 + 125 = 250.

Next, we calculate the number of chimichangas made on Fridays, which is twice the number made on Tuesdays and Wednesdays: 2 * 125 = 250.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To determine the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we can use the concept of percentages and division.

First, we need to find 20% of the total number of microphones, which represents the number of microphones that won't fit. This can be calculated as 0.2 * 50 = 10.

The remaining microphones that can fit in pairs are 50 - 10 = 40.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we can find the number of pairs by dividing the number of microphones that can fit by 2: 40 / 2 = 20.

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of birds, we can break down the problem into three distinct components: birds in the bushes, birds flying overhead, and birds feeding.

First, we calculate the number of birds flying overhead, which is 2/3 of the number of birds in the bushes. This can be expressed as:

(2/3) * 6 = 4

Next, we calculate the total number of birds feeding, which is 3 groups of 8 birds each:

3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, the number of birds flying overhead, and the number of birds feeding to find the total:

6 + 4 + 24 = 34

Therefore, the total number of birds is 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the number of cookies in each jar, we can employ a straightforward division operation. 

Given that Lani baked 55 cookies and ate 5, the number of cookies left is 55 - 5 = 50. 

Since the remaining cookies are to be divided equally into 5 jars, we can calculate the number of cookies in each jar by dividing the total number of cookies left by 5.

Cookies in each jar = Total cookies left / Number of jars
Cookies in each jar = 50 / 5
Cookies in each jar = 10

Therefore, there are 10 cookies in each jar."
"To determine the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and orchids, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of orchids as O and the number of daisies as D. We are given that O = 5 and D = 4.

The total number of petals on the orchids can be represented as 5O, and the total number of petals on the daisies can be represented as 10D. To find the difference in the number of petals, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 10D - 5O.

Substituting the given values, we get: 10(4) - 5(5) = 40 - 25 = 15.

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we find the number of indoor plants, which is one-fourth of the total number of plants. This can be calculated as:

(1/4) × 100 = 25

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after removing the indoor plants. This is done by subtracting the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants:

100 - 25 = 75

Now, we calculate the number of outdoor plants, which is two-thirds of the remaining plants:

(2/3) × 75 = 50

Finally, we find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

75 - 50 = 25

To express this as a percentage, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:

(25 ÷ 100) × 100 = 25%

Therefore, 25% of the plants in Mrs. Smith's garden are flowering plants.

The final answer is 25%."
"To determine the speed of the whirligig, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the speeds of the whirligig and the thingamabob. 

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x. Since a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob, we can express the speed of the whatchamacallit as 11x. 

We are given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 
11x = 121 

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 11: 
x = 121 / 11 
x = 11 

Now that we have determined the speed of the thingamabob (x = 11 meters per second), we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob. 
Speed of whirligig = 5x 
= 5 * 11 
= 55 meters per second 

The speed of the whirligig is 55 meters per second."
"To determine the cost of one carrot, we can start by calculating the total cost of the salad and yogurt. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

Therefore, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day.

The final answer is: $2"
"To calculate Mark's new weekly earnings, we can apply the concept of hourly wage multiplication. Given that Mark's original hourly wage was $10 and it was increased by $2, his new hourly wage is $12.

The total number of hours worked in a week can be calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked per day (8) by the number of days worked per week (5).

Total hours worked per week = 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week

Now, we can calculate Mark's new weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the total number of hours worked per week.

Weekly earnings = New hourly wage * Total hours worked per week
Weekly earnings = $12/hour * 40 hours/week
Weekly earnings = $480/week

Therefore, Mark's new weekly earnings are $480."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as x. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Given that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is 6x. We know that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

6x = 80

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 6:

x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now, we can find the total amount she earned from mowing lawns:
6x = 6 * 13
6x = 78

To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the amount she earned from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
80 - 78 = 2

The final answer is: $2"

Given:
1. M = 55 kg
2. C = M + 16
3. X = C + 8
4. H = X - 5

Substituting the given values, we get:
C = 55 + 16 = 71 kg
X = 71 + 8 = 79 kg
H = 79 - 5 = 74 kg

Therefore, Harry's weight is 74 kg.

The final answer is: $\boxed{74}$"
"To calculate John's profit, we can employ the fundamental principles of arithmetic. 

First, we need to determine the total amount John earns from renting his car. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of hours he works per month (10 hours) by his hourly wage ($25). 

Total earnings = 10 hours * $25/hour = $250

Next, we subtract the car payment from the total earnings to determine the profit. 

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $250 - $500
Profit = -$250

However, since profit cannot be negative, we must reevaluate the calculation. It appears that John's car payment exceeds his total earnings. This indicates that John is actually operating at a loss.

The final answer is: -$250"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic methods to determine the initial number of notebooks Joseph had. Let's represent the number of notebooks Joseph had as x. Since Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, we can set up the equation:

3x = 7

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 7/3

x = 2.33 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the difference in the number of notebooks between Martha and Joseph:

Martha's notebooks: 7
Joseph's notebooks: 2.33

The difference is: 7 - 2.33 = 4.67

Therefore, Martha has 4.67 more notebooks than Joseph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4.67}$"
"To calculate the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Given that Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can express this as a ratio:

Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both of them by adding their individual distances:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

Therefore, the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis is 110 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"
"To determine the number of cookies each nephew will receive, we must first account for the reduction in the total number of cookies due to the husband's actions.

Let's denote the initial number of cookies as C and the number of nephews as n. The problem states that Susan made 100 cookies, so C = 100. The husband took 4 cookies, leaving us with C - 4 cookies. We are then dividing these remaining cookies among the 6 nephews.

Cookies per nephew = (C - 4) / n
Cookies per nephew = (100 - 4) / 6
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

Therefore, each nephew will receive 16 cookies."
"To determine the difference in pages read by Denise and Daniel, we can analyze their reading patterns.

Let's denote the number of pages Denise read yesterday as D1 and the number of pages Daniel read yesterday as D2. We are given that D1 = 10 and D2 = 13.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, we can represent the number of pages Denise read today as D3 = D1 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

The total number of pages read by Denise is the sum of the pages read yesterday and today, which is D1 + D3 = 10 + 15 = 25.

The total number of pages read by Daniel is the sum of the pages read yesterday, which is D2 = 13.

To find the difference in pages read by Denise and Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise: 25 - 13 = 12.

Therefore, Denise read 12 more pages than Daniel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to consider the total capacity of the pot and the number of bowls consumed for dinner.

Let's denote the total capacity of the pot as C and the number of bowls consumed for dinner as D. We know that C can fill either four adult bowls or eight child's bowls. This implies that C = 4x and C = 8y, where x and y are positive integers.

Since there are four adults, the number of bowls consumed for dinner is D = 4. We can set up the equation 4x = 8y, which simplifies to x = 2y.

Now, we need to find the number of bowls left for lunch, which is C - D. Since C = 4x and D = 4, we can substitute x = 2y into the equation C = 4x to get C = 4(2y) = 8y.

Substituting C = 8y and D = 4 into the equation C - D, we get 8y - 4 = 4y. This implies that the number of bowls left for lunch is 4y.

Since there are two children, we can divide the number of bowls left for lunch by 2 to find the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. This gives us 4y / 2 = 2y.

However, we need to consider the fact that the number of bowls left for lunch must be a whole number, as we cannot have a fraction of a bowl. Since y is a positive integer, the minimum value of y is 1, which gives us 2(1) = 2.

Therefore, each child can have 2 bowls of soup for lunch.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we can apply the principle of arithmetic addition. 

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 × $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 1 ballpen is $0.50

Total cost = $7.50 + $0.50 = $8

Therefore, the total amount William spent is $8."
"To determine the total material required, we can calculate the material needed for small and large masks separately.

For small masks, we have 20 masks, and each set requires 2 yards of material. To find the total material needed, we can divide the total number of masks by the number of masks per set and multiply by the material required per set:

20 masks / 4 masks per set = 5 sets
5 sets * 2 yards per set = 10 yards

For large masks, we have 8 masks, and each set requires 2.25 yards of material. To find the total material needed, we can divide the total number of masks by the number of masks per set and multiply by the material required per set:

8 masks / 3 masks per set = 2.67 sets
2.67 sets * 2.25 yards per set = 6 yards

Now, we can add the material needed for small and large masks to find the total material required:

10 yards (small masks) + 6 yards (large masks) = 16 yards

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To calculate the average price per ticket, we can utilize the formula for average, which is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. In this scenario, the total amount spent ($216) is the sum of the individual ticket prices, and the total number of tickets (27) is the number of values.

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 ÷ 27
= $8

Therefore, the average price per ticket is $8."
"To determine Harold's free time, we must first calculate the total hours in a day and then subtract the hours spent on various activities.

A standard day consists of 24 hours. Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works 2 hours less than he sleeps, which translates to 10 - 2 = 8 hours of work. Additionally, he walks his dog for 1 hour.

The total hours spent on these activities can be calculated as follows:

10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Now, we subtract these hours from the total hours in a day:

24 (total hours in a day) - 19 (hours spent on activities) = 5 hours

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"

"To determine the number of books Joseph currently has, we can apply a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of books Sarah has as 's' and the number of books Joseph has as 'j'. We are given that s = 9 and j = 2s.

j = 2s
j = 2(9)
j = 18

However, we are also told that Joseph lost 2 books. To find the current number of books Joseph has, we subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had.

j - 2 = 18 - 2
j - 2 = 16

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To determine the number of marbles Dean has left, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of marbles Dean gave away. Since he gave 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie, we can express this as a fraction of the total:

1/5 * 30 = 6

Next, we add the 10 marbles he gave to Donald:

6 (given to Jamie) + 10 (given to Donald) = 16

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the initial total:

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Adam's current age as 'x'. We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be translated into the equation:

Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 * Adam's age 4 years ago
60 - 8 = 2 * (x - 4)
52 = 2x - 8

Now, we can solve for 'x' by adding 8 to both sides of the equation:

52 + 8 = 2x
60 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 yields:

x = 60 / 2
x = 30

Therefore, Adam's current age is 30. To determine Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To determine the total number of acres of the two farms, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote the number of acres of Farmer Brown's farm as B and the number of acres of Farmer Smith's farm as S. We are given that B = 200 and S = 2B + 100.

We can substitute the value of B into the equation for S: 
S = 2(200) + 100
S = 400 + 100
S = 500

Now, we can find the total number of acres by adding the acres of both farms:
Total Acres = B + S
Total Acres = 200 + 500
Total Acres = 700

Therefore, the total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"To determine Colby's daily earnings, we must first calculate his hourly production rate and then multiply it by the number of hours worked.

Colby's hourly production rate is 50 packages per hour minus 10 packages per hour, which equals 40 packages per hour. 

To find his daily earnings, we multiply his hourly production rate by the number of hours worked, which is 8 hours. 

Daily earnings = (40 packages/hour) * (8 hours) = 320 packages

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package, we can calculate his daily earnings as follows:

Daily earnings = 320 packages * $0.20/package = $64

The final answer is: $64"
"To determine the number of bottles of water John drinks, we must first calculate the total time spent on sudoku puzzles. 

A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that duration. Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is:

Time for a normal sudoku: 45 minutes
Time for an extreme sudoku: 4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Total time spent on sudoku: 45 minutes + 180 minutes = 225 minutes

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can calculate the number of bottles by dividing the total time by 30 minutes:

Number of bottles = Total time / 30 minutes
= 225 minutes / 30 minutes
= 7.5

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a bottle, we must round down to the nearest whole number. 

The correct answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of red balloons as R and the number of yellow balloons as Y. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We can set up the following equation based on the total number of bologna pieces thrown:

2R + 3Y = 58

We are also given that there are 20 red balloons, so we can substitute R = 20 into the equation:

2(20) + 3Y = 58

Simplifying the equation, we get:

40 + 3Y = 58

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:

3Y = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

Y = 6

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we can utilize the concept of division to calculate the total number of miles driven and then divide by the interval at which the tune-ups are required.

Given that Jon drives 100 miles per day for 30 days, the total miles driven can be calculated as:

Total miles = miles/day * days = 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since the tune-ups are required every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by the interval to find the number of tune-ups needed:

Number of tune-ups = Total miles / miles per tune-up = 3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Therefore, Jon requires 3 tune-ups during the 30-day period."
"To determine the total hours worked by Bruce over the three days, we can apply basic arithmetic operations.

First, we calculate the hours worked on each day:

Tuesday: 5 hours
Wednesday: 2 * 5 = 10 hours
Thursday: 10 - 2 = 8 hours

Now, we sum the hours worked each day to find the total hours worked:

Total hours = 5 + 10 + 8
Total hours = 23

Therefore, Bruce works a total of 23 hours over the three days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the amount of money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we can analyze the expenses and set up an equation.

Let's denote the amount of money each girl received as x. The total amount spent on the cake and balloons is $11 + $6 = $17. Additionally, they spent $14 on 2 tubs of ice cream. The total amount spent is $17 + $14 = $31.

Since they started with the same amount of money, we can set up the equation: 2x = 31.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 31 ÷ 2

x = 15.5

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50.

Final Answer: The final answer is: $15.50"
"To determine the total number of fruits Kira has left, we must first calculate the initial total and then subtract the number of fruits eaten by Lola.

The total number of fruits initially is the sum of the individual quantities: 3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14.

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we subtract 2 from the total: 14 - 2 = 12.

Therefore, Kira has 12 pieces of fruit left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of students, we can break down the information into separate components and calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we have 6 students playing tennis. Since there are twice as many students playing volleyball, we can calculate the number of volleyball players as 2 * 6 = 12.

Next, we are given the number of soccer players as 16 boys and 22 girls, making a total of 16 + 22 = 38 students.

Now, we can add the number of students in each group to find the total number of students: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

Therefore, the total number of students is 56."
"To calculate the total amount of money raised, we can employ the concept of multiplication to find the total number of lollipops sold and then multiply it by the profit per lollipop.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold:
Number of lollipops sold = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student
= 30 * 10
= 300 lollipops

2. Calculate the profit per lollipop:
Profit per lollipop = Selling price - Cost price
= $0.8 - $0.5
= $0.3

3. Calculate the total profit:
Total profit = Number of lollipops sold * Profit per lollipop
= 300 * $0.3
= $90

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we can break down the information into separate equations and solve for each variable.

Let's denote the number of cats as C, dogs as D, rabbits as R, fish as F, and gerbils as G.

We are given the following information:

1. C = 3
2. D = 3C
3. R = D - 2
4. F = 3R
5. G = (1/3)F

We can substitute the values of C and D into equation 3 to find R:
R = 3(3) - 2
R = 9 - 2
R = 7

Next, we can substitute the value of R into equation 4 to find F:
F = 3(7)
F = 21

Now, we can substitute the value of F into equation 5 to find G:
G = (1/3)(21)
G = 7

Finally, we can add up the total number of pets:
Total = C + D + R + F + G
Total = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7
Total = 47

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine the number of days the loaf of bread will last, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. 

Let's denote the number of slices Abby eats per day as A and the number of slices Josh eats per day as J. We are given that J = 2A. The total number of slices eaten per day is A + J, and the total number of slices in the loaf is 24.

We can express this information in the following equation:

A + J = 24

Substituting J = 2A into the equation, we get:

A + 2A = 24

Combine like terms:

3A = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

A = 8

Now that we know Abby eats 8 slices per day, we can find the total number of slices eaten per day (A + J):

A + J = 8 + 2A
= 8 + 2(8)
= 8 + 16
= 24

However, this is the total number of slices eaten per day, not the number of days the loaf will last. To find the number of days, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total number of slices eaten per day (24):

24 ÷ 24 = 1

The loaf of bread will last 1 day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the total number of shells Martha has collected, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic sequences. Since Martha collects one shell per month, the number of shells she has collected forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1.

The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

an = a1 + (n - 1)d

where an is the nth term, a1 is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference.

In this case, a1 = 1 (since Martha starts collecting shells at 5 years old), and d = 1 (since she collects one shell per month). We want to find the 60th term (since she has been collecting shells for 5 years, which is equivalent to 60 months).

Plugging in the values, we get:

a60 = 1 + (60 - 1)1
a60 = 1 + 59
a60 = 60

Therefore, Martha has collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we can utilize the concept of division. Given that Lana has a total of 27 cups and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the remaining cups are allocated for mint tea. 

First, we calculate the number of cups of mint tea: 27 (total cups) - 15 (cinnamon tea) = 12 cups of mint tea.

Since the mint tea is divided equally among 3 rows, we can express this as a division problem: 12 ÷ 3 = 4.

Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the minimum number of berries the sloth can collect per trip, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

Let's denote the number of berries the sloth picks per trip as 'x'. Since the sloth makes two round trips in 8 hours, the total number of berries collected can be represented as 2x. We are given that the total number of berries collected should be 24. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2x = 24

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 24 / 2
x = 12

Thus, the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick per trip is 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the initial amount of water in the tank, which is half of the pool's capacity. This can be expressed as:

Initial water in tank = (1/2) * 10000 gallons
Initial water in tank = 5000 gallons

Next, we need to account for the rate at which the tank is being emptied. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. To find the total amount of water emptied after 6 days, we can multiply the rate by the number of days:

Total water emptied = 500 gallons/day * 6 days
Total water emptied = 3000 gallons

Now, we can find the remaining amount of water in the tank by subtracting the total amount emptied from the initial amount:

Remaining water in tank = Initial water in tank - Total water emptied
Remaining water in tank = 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons
Remaining water in tank = 2000 gallons

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To determine the maximum number of movies Colby can see, we must first calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the popcorn and candy expenses. His monthly allowance is $150, and he has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, resulting in a remaining budget of $150 - $8 - $8 = $134.

Since it's a Friday, Colby wants to purchase a ticket, which costs $10. Subtracting this from his remaining budget yields $134 - $10 = $124.

To find the maximum number of movies he can see, we divide the remaining budget by the cost of a movie ticket: $124 ÷ $10 = 12.4.

However, since Colby cannot purchase a fraction of a ticket, we must round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Colby can see 12 movies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To calculate the total calories of the pastries, we can utilize the concept of weighted averages. 

Let's denote the calories of a normal cinnamon roll as C and a normal blueberry muffin as B. We are given that a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of its normal counterpart. Therefore, the calories of a mini cinnamon roll can be expressed as C/3, and the calories of a mini blueberry muffin can be expressed as B/3.

We are given that C = 600 and B = 450. To find the total calories of the pastries, we can calculate the total calories of the mini pastries and add them together.

Total calories of mini pastries = (200 * C/3) + (300 * B/3)
= (200 * 600/3) + (300 * 450/3)
= (120,000/3) + (135,000/3)
= 255,000/3
= 85,000

Therefore, the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000.

The final answer is 85,000."
"To calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic mean. The formula for the arithmetic mean is:

Average = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)

In this scenario, the sum of all values represents the total number of Junebugs removed, and the number of values represents the number of days.

First, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed:

Monday: 39 Junebugs
Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs (combined)
Thursday: 48 Junebugs
Friday: 57 Junebugs

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 262

Now, we can calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day:

Average = (262) / (5)
Average = 52.4

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs removed per day is 52.4.

The final answer is 52.4."
"To determine the distance difference between the bus and the car, we can apply the formula for distance, which is:

Distance = Speed × Time

For the bus: Distance = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car: Distance = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we can find the difference in distance traveled by subtracting the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:

Distance difference = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To determine the number of bouncy balls, we can utilize the principle of addition and subtraction. 

Let's denote the number of bouncy balls as x. We know that the total number of toys initially is the sum of the blocks, stuffed animals, and rings, which is 31 + 8 + 9 = 48. After adding the bouncy balls, the total number of toys becomes 62. 

We can set up the equation: 48 + x = 62

To solve for x, we subtract 48 from both sides of the equation:

x = 62 - 48
x = 14

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls is 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's represent Peter's age as P, Paul's age as P + 10, and Jean's age as J.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + (P + 10) + J = 100
2. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's and Jean's age: P = (P + 10) + J

We can simplify the first equation by combining like terms:

2P + J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2P + J = 90

Now, we can substitute P = (P + 10) + J into the equation 2P + J = 90:

2((P + 10) + J) + J = 90

Expand and simplify:

2P + 20 + 2J = 90

Subtract 20 from both sides:

2P + 2J = 70

Divide both sides by 2:

P + J = 35

Now, we can substitute P = (P + 10) + J into the equation P + J = 35:

(P + 10) + J + J = 35

Combine like terms:

P + 2J + 10 = 35

Subtract 10 from both sides:

P + 2J = 25

Now we have two equations:

P + J = 35
P + 2J = 25

Subtract the first equation from the second equation:

(P + 2J) - (P + J) = 25 - 35

This simplifies to:

J = -10

However, this is not a valid solution since age cannot be negative. Let's re-examine the system of equations.

We can rewrite the second equation as:

P = J + 10

Substitute this expression for P into the first equation:

(J + 10) + J + 10 = 100

Combine like terms:

2J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

2J = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

J = 40

Now that we have J, we can find P:

P = J + 10
P = 40 + 10
P = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total number of water balloons, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 water balloons each, resulting in a total of 8 balloons. Adding Maria's 1 balloon, the total becomes 9.

Next, we need to account for the additional balloons provided by Maria's mom. Since there are 5 individuals (Maria and her 4 friends), and each received 3 more balloons, the total number of additional balloons is 5 * 3 = 15.

Combining the initial 9 balloons with the additional 15 balloons, we obtain a grand total of 9 + 15 = 24 water balloons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of new tables required, we must first calculate the total number of boxes available for display. 

The charity group has received 10 people donating 5 boxes each, resulting in a total of 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. Additionally, they already possess 10 boxes, bringing the total to 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since each table can accommodate 2 boxes, we can calculate the required number of tables by dividing the total number of boxes by 2.

Number of tables needed = Total boxes / 2
= 60 boxes / 2
= 30 tables

As the charity group already has 15 tables, we can find the number of new tables required by subtracting the existing tables from the total needed.

New tables needed = Total tables needed - Existing tables
= 30 tables - 15 tables
= 15 tables

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables to accommodate the donated items."
"To determine the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney, and then divide it by 2.

Let's calculate the total distance spat by each individual:

Zoey's total distance = Number of seeds * Distance per seed
= 40 * 10
= 400 feet

Sydney's total distance = Number of seeds * Distance per seed
= 35 * 12
= 420 feet

Total distance spat by both = Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance
= 400 feet + 420 feet
= 820 feet

Average total distance spat = Total distance spat by both / 2
= 820 feet / 2
= 410 feet

Therefore, the average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in the total amount of money Fern will make from the two machines, we can calculate the monthly production and revenue for each machine.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets/month
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets/month

Next, we multiply the total number of widgets produced by the price of each widget to find the total revenue:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets/month * $6/widget = $259,200/month
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets/month * $6/widget = $194,400/month

Now, we can find the difference in the total amount of money Fern will make from the two machines by subtracting the revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue of the Widgeteer 3000:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month."
"To determine the cost of Cameron's extended stay, we can break down the calculation into two parts: the initial 12-hour stay and the additional hours beyond that.

The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. Since Cameron stays for 5 hours beyond the 12-hour mark, we need to calculate the cost of these additional hours.

The cost of the additional hours is calculated as 5 hours * 70 pesos per hour = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the extended stay is the sum of the initial 12-hour stay and the additional hours: 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find the amount saved by choosing the extended stay over the 24-hour option, we subtract the cost of the extended stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the extended stay option.

Final answer: 250"
"To determine the total amount of hay needed, we can break down the problem into two parts: the hay required for the goats and the hay required for the sheep.

Let's start by calculating the hay needed for the goats. Since each goat requires 5 pounds of hay, and there are 15 goats, the total amount of hay needed for the goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.

Next, we need to calculate the hay required for the sheep. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, which can be expressed as 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds. Since there are 12 sheep, the total amount of hay needed for the sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the hay required for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay in total."
"To determine John's remaining funds after purchasing the pencils, we can calculate his earnings and subsequent expenditures.

John's hourly wage is $50, and he worked for 6 hours, resulting in total earnings of $300. After spending $50 on gas, he has $300 - $50 = $250.

He then purchases 5 pencils at $10 each, totaling $50. Subtracting this from his remaining funds, we get $250 - $50 = $200.

John aims to deposit $100 into the bank, leaving him with $200 - $100 = $100.

To find out how many 25-dollar pens he can purchase, we can divide his remaining funds by the cost of a single pen: $100 ÷ $25 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig and his brother, we can calculate the total number of letters as follows:

Craig's total number of letters = Number of words * Number of letters per word
Craig's total number of letters = 20 * 15
Craig's total number of letters = 300

Since Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, we can calculate his total number of letters as follows:

Craig's brother's total number of letters = Craig's total number of letters + 50
Craig's brother's total number of letters = 300 + 50
Craig's brother's total number of letters = 350

Therefore, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 350."
"To determine the total number of children participating in the drill, we can utilize the concept of multiplication. Since there are 8 children in each row and 7 rows in total, we can calculate the total number of children by multiplying these two values.

The formula for this calculation is: Total number of children = Number of children in each row * Number of rows

Applying the given values, we get: Total number of children = 8 * 7

This calculation yields a result of 56.

"To determine the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we calculate the total number of bottles given to the students. With 29 pupils and 2 bottles per pupil, the total number of bottles distributed is:

29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles

Next, we consider the teacher's available coupons. Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, and the teacher has 9 coupons. Thus, the total number of bottles the teacher can obtain is:

9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can obtain:

900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

Therefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{842}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we can break down the components of the charge. The labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (2.25) by the hourly rate ($35). This results in a labor cost of $78.75.

The total fixed charge is a flat rate of $40.

The cost of parts is given as $60.

The total cost is the sum of the labor cost, the total fixed charge, and the cost of parts. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total Cost = Labor Cost + Total Fixed Charge + Cost of Parts
Total Cost = $78.75 + $40 + $60
Total Cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To calculate the amount James was out, we need to consider the total cost of the CDs and the amount he received from selling some of them.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:

Total cost of CDs = Number of CDs * Price per CD
Total cost of CDs = 10 * $15
Total cost of CDs = $150

Since James received a 40% discount, we can calculate the discount amount as follows:

Discount amount = Total cost of CDs * Discount percentage
Discount amount = $150 * 0.4
Discount amount = $60

Now, let's calculate the total amount James received from selling 5 CDs:

Total amount from selling CDs = Number of CDs sold * Price per CD
Total amount from selling CDs = 5 * $40
Total amount from selling CDs = $200

To find out how much James was out, we subtract the total amount he received from the total cost of the CDs:

Amount James was out = Total cost of CDs - Total amount from selling CDs
Amount James was out = $150 - $200
Amount James was out = -$50

Therefore, James was out $50.

Final answer: $50"
"To calculate the total amount Jen will earn from selling her root crops, we can use the following formula:

Total Earnings = (Number of Yams * Price per Yam) + (Number of Sweet Potatoes * Price per Sweet Potato) + (Number of Carrots * Price per Carrot)

Plugging in the given values, we get:

Total Earnings = (6 * $1.50) + (10 * $2.00) + (4 * $1.25)
Total Earnings = $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00
Total Earnings = $34.00

Therefore, the total amount Jen will earn from selling her root crops is $34.00."
"To calculate the total time James spends on the entire journey, we can break it down into three distinct segments: the initial swimming segment, the resting period, and the final swimming segment.

Let's denote the total distance as D, the initial swimming speed as S1, the resting time as R, and the final swimming speed as S2. We are given that D = 20 miles, S1 = 2 miles per hour, and S2 = 1 mile per hour.

First, we calculate the distance covered during the initial swimming segment:
Distance = S1 * Time = 2 miles/hour * Time1

We are given that James swims 60% of the total distance, so the distance covered during the initial swimming segment is:
Distance = 0.6 * D = 0.6 * 20 miles = 12 miles

Now, we can calculate the time spent during the initial swimming segment:
Time1 = Distance / S1 = 12 miles / 2 miles/hour = 6 hours

Next, we calculate the resting time:
R = Time1 = 6 hours

The remaining distance to be covered is:
Distance = D - Distance = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

Now, we calculate the time spent during the final swimming segment:
Time2 = Distance / S2 = 8 miles / 1 mile/hour = 8 hours

Finally, we calculate the total time:
Total time = Time1 + R + Time2 = 6 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 20 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of loaves Sam had last Friday as 'x'. According to the problem, the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had. This can be represented as 7x - 40.

We are given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, so we can set up the equation:

7x - 40 = 70

To solve for x, we can add 40 to both sides of the equation:

7x = 70 + 40
7x = 110

Next, we divide both sides by 7:

x = 110 / 7
x = 15.71 (approximately)

Since we cannot have a fraction of a loaf, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more accurate to express the solution as a decimal, as it represents the exact number of loaves Sam had.

Now that we know Sam had approximately 15.71 loaves, we can calculate the number of loaves the bakery has by multiplying this value by 7 and subtracting 40:

7 * 15.71 = 109.97
109.97 - 40 = 69.97

Rounding down to the nearest whole number, the bakery has approximately 70 loaves of bread.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the total number of stickers Jasmine has at the end, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. 

First, we start with the initial number of stickers Jasmine received, which is 15. Then, we subtract the number of stickers she lost during playtime, which is 7. This can be represented as:

15 - 7 = 8

Next, we add the number of stickers her teacher gave her for helping her classmates, which is 5. This can be represented as:

8 + 5 = 13

Therefore, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

The final answer is 13."
"To calculate Cayley's total commission, we can break down the problem into two parts: the commission from the New York Times and the commission from the Wall Street Journal.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times. The commission rate is 10% and the cost of each copy is $5. We can express this as a mathematical expression: 0.10 * 5 = 0.5. Since there are 6 copies sold, the total commission from the New York Times is 6 * 0.5 = $3.

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal. The commission rate is 8% and the cost of each copy is $15. We can express this as a mathematical expression: 0.08 * 15 = 1.2. Since there are 10 copies sold, the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is 10 * 1.2 = $12.

Now, we can find the total commission by adding the commission from the New York Times and the commission from the Wall Street Journal: $3 + $12 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the ages of Marcus, Leo, and Deanna. Let's denote Marcus's age as M, Leo's age as L, and Deanna's age as D.

We are given that Deanna is 26 years old, so D = 26.

We also know that Marcus is half of Leo's age, which can be represented as M = 0.5L.

Additionally, Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so M = D - 5.

Substituting the value of D into the second equation, we get M = 0.5L = 26 - 5 = 21.

Now, we can solve for L by substituting the value of M into the first equation: 21 = 0.5L.

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get L = 21 * 2 = 42.

Therefore, Leo's age is 42 years old.

42"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, we can represent Bahati's score as (x + 20). We know that Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so we can also represent Bahati's score as (x + 10).

The total points scored by all three team members is 45. We can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + ((x + 10) - 20) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 45

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 55

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 55/3

x = 18.33

Since the number of points scored cannot be a fraction, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can express the exact value of x as a fraction.

Now, we can find Azibo's score by substituting the value of x into the expression (x + 10):

Azibo's score = (55/3) + 10

To add these values, we need a common denominator, which is 3. So, we can rewrite 10 as (30/3):

Azibo's score = (55/3) + (30/3)

Combine the fractions:

Azibo's score = (85/3)

To convert this to a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

Azibo's score = 28 1/3

However, since the question does not explicitly ask for a mixed number, we can leave the answer as an improper fraction.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{85}{3}}$"
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we can utilize the concept of linear density. Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick and each paper is 2 pages thick, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:

Let's denote the number of pages per inch as p. Since each paper is 2 pages thick, we have:

p = 2 pages/inch

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages in the book by multiplying the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

Total pages = p * thickness
Total pages = 2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches
Total pages = 3 pages

Therefore, the book contains 3 pages."
"To calculate the total number of reports stapled by Vince, we can utilize the concept of unit rates and multiplication. 

First, we determine the number of 15-minute intervals within the given time frame. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM can be broken down into two segments: 4 hours (240 minutes) and 11 hours (660 minutes). 

Total minutes = 240 + 660 = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can express this as a unit rate of 30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports per minute.

Now, we multiply the total minutes by the unit rate to find the total number of reports stapled:

Total reports = 900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

Therefore, Vince stapled 1800 reports in the given time frame."
"To determine the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we must consider the time she spent sleepwalking and her early morning wake-up.

First, let's calculate the total minutes she slept from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.:

10 p.m. to 12 a.m. = 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
12 a.m. to 2:15 a.m. = 2 hours 15 minutes = 135 minutes
2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. = 23 minutes
2:38 a.m. to 6 a.m. = 3 hours 22 minutes = 182 minutes

Now, we add up the minutes:
120 + 135 + 23 + 182 = 460 minutes

However, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so we need to subtract those minutes:
460 - 5 = 455 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{455}$"
"To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we need to calculate the number of measuring spoons he has after gifting Pedro 6 spoons.

Jonathan initially has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Since he has 2 dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Number of measuring spoons = (2/3) * Number of measuring cups
= (2/3) * 24
= (2 * 24) / 3
= 48 / 3
= 16

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of measuring spoons and measuring cups:
10 (measuring spoons) + 24 (measuring cups) = 34

The final answer is 34."
"To determine the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we must first calculate the initial number of occupied beds and then account for the daily admissions.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 occupied. This can be expressed as a fraction: 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds.

Next, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted over a 2-week period. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks consist of 14 days. With 50 patients admitted each day, the total number of admissions is 50 * 14 = 700 patients.

To find the total number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of admissions from the initial number of occupied beds: 200 - 700 = -500. However, this result is not feasible, as the number of unoccupied beds cannot be negative. This indicates that the hospital is experiencing a shortage of beds.

Let's re-evaluate the situation. The hospital has 1000 beds, with 1/5 occupied, which equals 200 beds. The daily admissions are 50, and over 2 weeks, this results in 700 admissions. To find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks, we can calculate the number of occupied beds at the end of 2 weeks by adding the initial occupied beds to the admissions: 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

Now, we can find the number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total occupied beds from the hospital's capacity: 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to find the number of non-work emails. Since Robyn sends 16 emails per day and 7 of them are work emails, the number of non-work emails is:

16 - 7 = 9

Next, we know that two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to family. To find the number of emails sent to family, we can calculate:

(2/3) * 9 = 6

Now, we need to find the number of non-work emails sent to her boyfriend. Since one-third of the non-work emails are sent to him, we can calculate:

(1/3) * 9 = 3

Therefore, Robyn sends 3 emails to her boyfriend per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to establish a relationship between the ages of Shawna and Aliya. We are told that Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. This can be expressed as:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years

Now, we are also given that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. We can express this as:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number. This can be achieved using the following formula:

Let x be the correct number of people who attended the concert.

The equation can be set up as follows:

x + 0.20x = 48

Combine like terms:

1.20x = 48

Divide both sides by 1.20:

x = 48 / 1.20

x = 40

Therefore, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason's balls can be represented as 2x. Given that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan's balls can be expressed as 2(2x) = 4x.

We are also given that Jason carried 2 balls, which allows us to set up the equation 2x = 2. Solving for x, we find that x = 1.

Now, we can determine the number of balls carried by each individual:
- Jeffrey's balls = x = 1
- Jason's balls = 2x = 2
- Jordan's balls = 4x = 4

The total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
Total balls = Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls
Total balls = 4 + 2 + 1
Total balls = 7

Therefore, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To determine the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we can analyze the given information as follows:

Let's denote the total number of holes dug on the fourth day as x. We know that the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the third day. Since the pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 6 holes on the third day, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29.

The total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is 4 times the number of holes dug by the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation:

10 + 13 + 6 + x = 4(29)

Combine like terms:

29 + x = 116

Subtract 29 from both sides:

x = 87

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 87.

The final answer is: $\boxed{87}$"
"To determine the total number of corn chips, we can utilize the concept of equal distribution and the given information about the difference in the number of chips received by each individual.

Let's denote the number of corn chips each of Amora and Lainey received as 'x'. Since Collins received 15 more chips than the others, the number of chips Collins received can be expressed as x + 15.

We are given that Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, so we can set up the equation:

x + x = 70 + 70

Combine like terms:

2x = 140

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 70

Now that we know x, we can find the number of chips Collins received:

x + 15 = 70 + 15
= 85

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the chips received by each individual:

Total = x + x + (x + 15)
= 70 + 70 + 85
= 225

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"To calculate the cost of the travel, we can use the following formula:

Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + (50% of Cost of supplies)

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Cost of travel = $400 + 0.5 x $400

Using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can simplify this expression:

Cost of travel = $400 + $200
= $600

Therefore, the cost of the travel is $600."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of Pokémon caught by each individual. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We have the following system of equations:

1. A + S + X = 339 (Total number of Pokémon caught)
2. X = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
3. S = 4A - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe)

We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination methods. Let's use substitution.

From equation (3), we can express S in terms of A:
S = 4A - 13

Substitute this expression for S into equation (1):
A + (4A - 13) + X = 339

Combine like terms:
5A - 13 + X = 339

Now, substitute the expression for X from equation (2):
5A - 13 + (S + 5) = 339

Substitute S = 4A - 13:
5A - 13 + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"To determine the total time John will spend watching the show, we can utilize the fundamental principles of arithmetic. Given that each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can calculate the total time by multiplying the number of episodes by the duration of each episode.

Let's denote the number of episodes as 'n'. Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can express 'n' as n = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now, we can calculate the total time by multiplying the number of episodes by the duration of each episode:

Total time = n * 20
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200

Therefore, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode."
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we can apply the concept of displacement. The bird's total displacement is the vector sum of the individual displacements in each direction.

Let's break down the bird's journey into its components:

1. The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, resulting in a displacement of 10 * 30 = 300 miles south.
2. Then, the bird travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, resulting in a displacement of 2 * 18 = 36 miles north.
3. Finally, the bird travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, resulting in a displacement of 5 * 22 = 110 miles south.

To find the net displacement, we subtract the northward displacement from the southward displacement:
300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles south

Since the bird ends up 264 miles south of her starting point, the distance between her northern and southern homes is 264 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{264}$"
"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we must first calculate the total number of brownies she received and then subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta initially made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we can express this as 12.

She received 1/2 a dozen brownies at the office party. To convert this to a whole number, we multiply 1/2 by 12, which equals 6. Therefore, she received 6 brownies at the office party.

Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to her home. Again, since 1 dozen equals 12, we can express this as 4 * 12 = 48.

Now, we add the brownies she made for herself, the ones she received at the office party, and the ones her friends brought to her home: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. To convert this to a whole number, we multiply 1 1/2 by 12, which equals 18. Therefore, 18 brownies were eaten.

To find the number of brownies left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is 48."
"To determine the total age of the family members, we can break down the problem into three separate calculations.

First, we calculate Nani's brother's age, which is twice Nani's age: 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Next, we find Nani's sister's age, which is 25% younger than Nani's age. To calculate this, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 25/100 = 0.25. Then, we multiply Nani's age by this decimal: 8 * 0.25 = 2 years. So, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

Now, we can add the ages of the three family members: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years."
"To determine the total time required to string all the racquets, we can calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

Let's break down the calculation:

Time for synthetic gut: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
Time for polyester string: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
Time for hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

Therefore, the total time required to string all the racquets is 227 minutes."
"To calculate the total cost of the phones, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The cost of the first two phones is 2 x $600 = $1200.

Since each phone after the first two is half price, we can express this as 3 phones at $300 each. 

The cost of the remaining phones is 3 x $300 = $900.

The total cost is the sum of these two amounts: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

Therefore, the total cost of the phones is $2100."
"To determine the total number of players in both teams, we can utilize the concept of addition. Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Let C represent the number of players in Carlton's team and Z represent the number of players in Zeke's team.

C = 13
Z = C + 7

To find the total number of players in both teams, we can add the number of players in each team:

Total = C + Z
Total = 13 + (13 + 7)
Total = 13 + 20
Total = 33

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To determine the total number of wooden slats required, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence, which can be found using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to find the total number of wooden slats required:

Total wooden slats = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats = 100

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats for his fence."
"To determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we must consider the sequence of events and the quantities involved.

First, we calculate the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially acquired: 12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges.

Next, we calculate the number of oranges she distributed to her mom and sister: 2 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 40 oranges.

Then, we calculate the number of oranges she retained: 1/4 of 240 oranges = 60 oranges.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges she kept and distributed from the initial total to find the number of oranges she sold: 240 - 40 - 60 = 140 oranges.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 140 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the total number of states in both countries, we need to calculate the number of states in the USA and add it to the number of states in India.

The number of states in the USA is 50. Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate half of 50 as follows:

50 / 2 = 25

Adding 4 to this result gives us the number of states in India:

25 + 4 = 29

Now, we can add the number of states in the USA and India to find the total:

50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to purchase: $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Next, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost to find the amount he still needs: $39 - $14 = $25.

Now, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find the number of hours he must work: $25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To determine the number of cherries Robert has more than Jerry, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of cherries Jerry has as 'x'. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Jerry, we can express Robert's cherries as 'x + 10'.

We know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert has 30 cherries. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + (x + 10) = 60

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 60

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 50

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 25

Now that we know Jerry has 25 cherries, we can find the difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = (x + 10) - x
= 10

Therefore, Robert has 10 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total earnings for Sunny's two-day fundraiser, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the number of gingerbread and apple pie boxes sold on each day, and then finding the total revenue.

Let's denote the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Saturday as G and the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday as A. We know that Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday, so G = 10.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Sunday is G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

We also know that he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Sunday than on Saturday, so the number of apple pie boxes sold on Sunday is A - 4.

Given that Sunny sold 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, we can set up an equation to find the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday: A - 4 = 15. Solving for A, we get A = 19.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for each day:

- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- 19 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $285

Total earnings for two days: $60 + $90 + $285 = $435

The final answer is: $435"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need, we can calculate the total number of hours she will be outside and then divide that by the amount of sunscreen she reappplies per hour.

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, the total number of hours she will be outside is 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours.

Given that her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, we can calculate the total amount of sunscreen needed as follows:

Total sunscreen needed = Total hours outside * Amount of sunscreen reapplied per hour
Total sunscreen needed = 32 hours * 1 ounce/hour
Total sunscreen needed = 32 ounces

Since the sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, we can divide the total amount needed by the bottle size to find the number of bottles required:

Number of bottles = Total sunscreen needed / Bottle size
Number of bottles = 32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle
Number of bottles = 4

Therefore, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"To determine the prices of the two cars, we can use the concept of percentages. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, which means it costs 60% of the price of the blue car.

Let's calculate the price of the red car:

Price of blue car = $100
Percentage of discount = 40%
Price of red car = 100% - 40% = 60% of $100
Price of red car = 0.6 x $100 = $60

Therefore, the blue car costs $100 and the red car costs $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between Emil's and his family members' ages.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We are given that E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so we can write the equation: 24 = D/2.

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so we can write the equation: 24 = 2B.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12.

The sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the total number of beads Adrianne had, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate the number of beads given by her sister, which is 10 more than the number of beads given by her mother. This can be expressed as:

Number of beads from sister = Number of beads from mother + 10
= 20 + 10
= 30

Next, we calculate the number of beads given by her friend, which is twice the number of beads given by her mother:

Number of beads from friend = 2 × Number of beads from mother
= 2 × 20
= 40

Now, we can find the total number of beads by adding the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:

Total number of beads = Number of beads from mother + Number of beads from sister + Number of beads from friend
= 20 + 30 + 40
= 90

Therefore, Adrianne had 90 beads altogether.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the total number of crawfish Joe caught, we can calculate the amount he caught each day and then convert it to servings.

First, let's calculate the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day:

Thursday: 3 pounds
Friday: 4 times Thursday's amount = 4 * 3 = 12 pounds
Saturday: half of Friday's amount = 12 / 2 = 6 pounds

Now, we can find the total amount of crawfish caught by adding the amounts from each day:

Total amount = 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:

Total servings = 21 / 3 = 7

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish."
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and then sum them up.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders/band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To find the average size of the shoes, we can utilize the formula for the mean of two numbers: (a + b) / 2, where 'a' and 'b' represent the sizes of the shoes.

Given that Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, we can express Charlie's boot size as 5 * 5 = 25.

Now, we can calculate the average size of the two shoes by plugging in the values into the formula:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

Therefore, the average size of the shoes is 15."
"To determine the total cost of the flowers, we need to calculate the number of additional flowers Pat needs to buy and then multiply that by the cost per flower.

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches: 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant, we can fit 1332 / 18 = 74 plants in the bed. However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 74 - 17 = 57 more flowers.

The cost of each flower is $6, so the total cost will be 57 * 6 = $342.

The final answer is: $342"
"To determine the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we can apply the concept of proportional reasoning. Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we can express this relationship as a ratio.

Let x be the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Then, the ratio of Edgar's brother's pretzel consumption to Edgar's pretzel consumption is 1/2 : 18. We can set up a proportion to solve for x:

1/2 : 18 = x : 18

Cross-multiplying, we get:

18 * 1/2 = 18x
9 = 18x

Dividing both sides by 18, we find:

x = 9/18
x = 1/2

Since x represents the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we can multiply x by 7 to find the number of pretzels he eats in a week:

x * 7 = (1/2) * 7
x * 7 = 7/2
x * 7 = 3.5

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 3.5 pretzels in a week."
"To calculate the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of petunias and the cost of sweet potato vines.

The cost of petunias can be calculated as 5 baskets multiplied by 3 petunias per basket, then multiplied by the cost per petunia, which is $3.00. This can be expressed as:

5 × 3 × $3.00 = $45.00

Similarly, the cost of sweet potato vines can be calculated as 5 baskets multiplied by 2 vines per basket, then multiplied by the cost per vine, which is $2.50. This can be expressed as:

5 × 2 × $2.50 = $25.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together:

$45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 to fill all 5 hanging baskets.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To determine the number of roses that can be planted, we must first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Let's denote the number of roses as 'r'. Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the total amount of soil used for roses is 'r' pounds.

We are given that 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations are planted. Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil. Therefore, the total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations is:

4 * 3 + 10 * 1.5 = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Since the total amount of soil available is 30 pounds, we can set up the equation:

r + 27 = 30

Subtracting 27 from both sides gives us:

r = 3

Therefore, the number of roses that can be planted is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate her monthly savings and then divide it by the cost of a single pair of shoes.

Jessica's monthly income is $2,000, and she sets aside 25% of her income for shoes. This can be calculated as:

$2,000 * 0.25 = $500 per month

Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000, we can calculate the number of pairs she can buy in a month:

$500 ÷ $1,000 = 0.5 pairs per month

To find the total number of pairs she can buy in a year, we multiply the monthly savings by 12:

0.5 pairs/month * 12 months = 6 pairs per year

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To determine the time it takes for Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we can break down the problem into two separate tasks: peeling and cooking.

First, let's analyze the peeling task. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we can use the formula:

Time = Total Shrimp / Shrimp per Minute
Time = 90 / 6
Time = 15 minutes

Next, let's analyze the cooking task. Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we can use the formula:

Time = Total Shrimp / Shrimp per Minute
Time = 90 / 30
Time = 3 minutes

Since these tasks are independent, we can add the times together to find the total time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp:

Total Time = Peeling Time + Cooking Time
Total Time = 15 + 3
Total Time = 18 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 18 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

Final answer: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the final temperature difference from the starting temperature, we can analyze the cooling and warming effects of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour. This results in a total cooling effect of 3 × 2 = 6 degrees.

Next, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour. This results in an additional cooling effect of 4 × 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is the sum of these two effects: 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

The room will warm up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour with no air conditioner running. Since the air conditioner was off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 × 2 = 4 degrees.

The final temperature difference from the starting temperature is the total cooling effect minus the warming effect: 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as x. We know that Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, which is 3(30) = 90 years old. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 90

Solving for x, we get:

x = 60

This means that 60 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can find the number of times it has orbited in 60 years by dividing 60 by 75, which is 4/5 or 0.8 (or 0.8 = 4/5).

However, this information is not necessary to find Bill's age when his dad saw the comet. We can directly calculate Bill's age at that time by subtracting 60 from 90, which gives us 30.

Therefore, Bill's age when his dad saw the comet was 30 years.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we can break down his monthly expenses into separate categories and calculate the total number of checks written in each category.

First, let's calculate the total number of checks written for the fixed monthly expenses:

- Electric bill: 1 check per month
- Gas bill: 1 check per month
Total fixed monthly checks: 1 + 1 = 2 checks

Next, we'll calculate the total number of checks written for the variable monthly expense:

- Church donations: 2 checks per month
Total variable monthly checks: 2 checks

Now, we'll calculate the total number of checks written for the quarterly expense:

- Pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

To find the total number of checks written per year, we'll multiply the total number of checks written for each category by the number of times it occurs in a year:

Total fixed monthly checks per year: 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks/year
Total variable monthly checks per year: 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks/year
Total checks per year: 24 checks/year + 24 checks/year = 48 checks/year

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 48 checks per year."
"To determine the number of flights to France made by the first plane, we can break down the information as follows:

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes, we can set up the equation:

44 = (1/2)x

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

x = 88

Now, we know the first plane makes 3/4 of its flights to Greece, so the number of flights to Greece is (3/4)x. Substituting x = 88, we get:

(3/4)(88) = 66

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2)(88 - 66). Simplifying, we get:

(1/2)(22) = 11

Therefore, the first plane makes 11 flights to France.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"The problem at hand involves determining the combined duration of the howls of three wolves, Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous. To approach this, we can break down the information provided and apply basic arithmetic operations.

We are given that Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Since Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, we can express this as 2 × 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so we can represent this as 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

To find the total duration, we add the individual howl times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60, as there are 60 seconds in a minute. This can be expressed as 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings, we can use basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his parents. His mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 x $6 = $12. The total amount received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Next, we subtract the total amount received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of averages and algebraic equations. Let's denote the ages of the children as A (Akbar), B (Alessandro), H (Helene), and W (Wilfred).

We are given the following information:

1. The total age of the children is 20: A + B + H + W = 20
2. Akbar's age is 3: A = 3
3. Alessandro's age is 4: B = 4
4. Helene's age is twice the average age: H = 2 * (A + B + W) / 4

First, substitute the values of A and B into the total age equation: 3 + 4 + H + W = 20
Simplifying the equation, we get: 7 + H + W = 20
Subtract 7 from both sides: H + W = 13

Now, substitute the expression for H into the equation: 2 * (3 + 4 + W) / 4 = 10
Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction: 2 * (7 + W) = 40
Distribute the 2: 14 + 2W = 40
Subtract 14 from both sides: 2W = 26
Divide both sides by 2: W = 13

The age of Wilfred is 13."
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far. This can be done by adding the initial contributions from his neighbors and the online fund.

Let's denote the amount collected from neighbors as N and the amount collected from the online fund as F. We are given that N = $500 and F = $1500. The total amount collected so far is N + F = $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Now, we know that Walter's lawyer will contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we can represent the amount contributed by Walter's lawyer as 3 * (N + F) = 3 * ($500 + $1500) = 3 * $2000 = $6000.

However, we are also told that Walter's friend is going to give him $200. This amount will be subtracted from the total amount collected, so the final amount Walter's lawyer will contribute is $6000 - $200 = $5800.

The final answer is: $5800"
"To determine the number of people in the church, we can utilize the concept of division to allocate the cookies. 

Given that each guest brought 15 cookies and the bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church, we can calculate the total number of cookies as follows:

Total number of cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Since the bride gave half of the cookies to the church, we can calculate the number of cookies given to the church as:

Number of cookies given to the church = Total number of cookies / 2 = 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Now, to find the number of people in the church, we can divide the number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

Number of people in the church = Number of cookies given to the church / 15 cookies/person = 750 / 15 = 50

Therefore, there were 50 people in the church."
"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we can employ a straightforward approach. Let's denote the total number of slices as 'T'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as large as each kid's slice, we can express the number of slices for the adults as 2x and for the kids as x.

We know that the total number of slices is the sum of the slices for the adults and the kids, so we can write the equation:

2x + x = T

Combine like terms:

3x = T

Divide both sides by 3:

x = T/3

Now, we can express the number of slices for the adults as 2x = 2(T/3) = (2/3)T.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we can divide the number of slices for the adults by the total number of slices and multiply by 100:

((2/3)T / T) * 100 = (2/3) * 100 = 66.67%

Therefore, each adult receives approximately 66.67% of the watermelon.

The final answer is 66.67."
"To determine the time Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we must first calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

The time spent on inpatient rounds can be calculated as 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient, which equals 180 minutes. Similarly, the time spent on appointments is 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment, resulting in 300 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of these two values: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours.

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest start time for Jordan to make the cake, we must consider the total time required to complete each task and add them together.

The time required to make the cake batter is 20 minutes, baking the cake is 30 minutes, cooling the cake is 120 minutes (or 2 hours), and frosting the cake is 10 minutes. 

We can convert the total time to hours and minutes for easier calculation: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes. Converting this to hours and minutes, we get 3 hours.

Now, we subtract the total time from the serving time to find the latest start time: 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.

Final answer: $\boxed{2:00 pm}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple division approach. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. Since Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, the total number of boxes sold is 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3.5x + 4.5x = 64

Combine like terms:

8x = 64

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 64 / 8

x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

Final answer: 8"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio is a fixed amount per week, which can be calculated as $25 per session multiplied by the number of days the studio is rented per week, resulting in $75 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total cost of renting the studio per month is $75 per week * 4 weeks = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students. Therefore, the total cost of students' lessons per week is $1.50 per student * 3 sessions per week * 10 students = $45 per week. In a month, this amounts to $45 per week * 4 weeks = $180.

The total expected earnings of the dance studio in a month can be found by adding the cost of renting the studio and the cost of students' lessons: $300 (renting) + $180 (students' lessons) = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in each box, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let x be the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter and y be the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha.

We know that Peter has 4 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars he has is 4x. Similarly, Martha has 7 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars she has is 7y.

We are given that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:

4x = 64
7y = 56

To solve for x and y, we can divide both sides of each equation by the coefficient of x and y, respectively.

x = 64 / 4
x = 16

y = 56 / 7
y = 8

Now that we have the values of x and y, we can find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter and Martha.

Difference = x - y
= 16 - 8
= 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total population of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to consider the initial population, the number of female porcupines, and the birth rate.

First, we calculate the number of female porcupines: 3/5 * 50 = 30.

Next, we calculate the total number of new porcupines per month: 30 * 4 = 120.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total population after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines: 50 + 1440 = 1490.

Therefore, the total population of porcupines in the park after a year will be 1490.

Final answer: $\boxed{1490}$"
"To calculate the volume of the pool, we'll employ the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length x width x height. In this case, the length is 25 feet, the width is 14 feet, and the height (or depth) is 4 feet.

Volume = Length x Width x Height
Volume = 25 x 14 x 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll perform the multiplication.

Total gallons = Volume x 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 x 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we'll calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon. To find the total cost, we'll multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = Total gallons x Cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 x 0.10
Cost = $826

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $826."
"To determine the total number of sticks, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we establish the number of blue sticks by adding 5 to the number of red sticks: 9 (red) + 5 = 14 (blue).

Next, we calculate the number of yellow sticks by subtracting 3 from the number of blue sticks: 14 (blue) - 3 = 11 (yellow).

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by summing the quantities of each color: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34 (total).

Therefore, the total number of sticks is 34."
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between Matteo and Shandy, we can apply the formula for distance, which is:

Distance = Speed × Time

For Matteo: Distance = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy: Distance = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we can find the difference in distance traveled by subtracting Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance:

Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance
= 450 miles - 220 miles
= 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy traveled 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"To determine the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the information into distinct categories.

First, we calculate the number of students over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500.

Next, we find the number of male students over 16 years old: 1500 / 4 = 375.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

Then, we calculate the number of male students under 16 years old: 1500 / 2 = 750.

Now, we can find the number of female students over 16 years old by subtracting the number of male students over 16 from the total number of students over 16: 1500 - 375 = 1125.

Similarly, we find the number of female students under 16 years old by subtracting the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Finally, we calculate the total number of female students by adding the number of female students over 16 and under 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To determine the number of laps Bethany can run more than Quinn, we need to calculate the difference between their respective lap counts.

First, we establish the number of laps each individual can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we calculate the difference between Bethany's and Quinn's lap counts: 10 - 5 = 5.

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we can analyze the work done by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days.

Let's break down the work done by each individual:

Day 1:
Wanda's work: 1/4 of the tank's capacity = 1/4 × 18000 = 4500 gallons
Ms. B's work: 3/4 of Wanda's work = 3/4 × 4500 = 3375 gallons

Total work done on Day 1: 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons

Day 2:
Wanda's work: 2/3 of her work on Day 1 = 2/3 × 4500 = 3000 gallons
Ms. B's work: 1/3 of her work on Day 1 = 1/3 × 3375 = 1125 gallons

Total work done on Day 2: 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons

The total work done over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining amount of water is:

Remaining water = Tank capacity - Total work done
= 18000 - 12000
= 6000 gallons

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation to model the charge remaining in the power bank over time. Let's denote the initial charge as x.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:

x - (9% * 5) = x - 0.45x = 0.55x

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:

0.55x - (7% * 3) = 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x

Since the charge remaining is 28% at the end, we can set up an equation:

0.34x = 0.28x

However, this equation doesn't make sense, as it implies x = 0, which is not possible. Let's re-examine the problem.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:

x - (9% * 5) = x - 0.45x = 0.55x

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:

0.55x - (7% * 3) = 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x

Since the charge remaining is 28% at the end, we can set up an equation:

0.34x = 0.28x + 0.07x

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:

x - (9% * 5) = x - 0.45x = 0.55x

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:

0.55x - (7% * 3) = 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x

"To calculate the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janet needs to save: 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000
2. Calculate Janet's total hourly wage: $10/hour (wages) + $15/hour (tips) = $25/hour
3. Calculate the number of hours Janet needs to work to save the down payment: $2,000 / $25/hour = 80 hours
4. Calculate the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment: 80 hours / 40 hours/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

Final Answer: The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of plums Jamaar can buy, we must first calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

"To determine the number of pieces of sweets each friend received, we can employ a straightforward division operation. 

First, we calculate the total number of pieces given away by subtracting the number of packs Anne kept from the total number of packs: 15 - 2 = 13.

Next, we multiply the number of packs given away by the number of pieces per pack: 13 * 60 = 780.

Now, we divide the total number of pieces given away by the number of friends: 780 ÷ 10 = 78.

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: $\boxed{78}$"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we can utilize the concept of compound interest. The price increase each year is 5% of the original price, which can be represented as a geometric sequence.

Year 1: 
Price increase = 0.05 * $120 = $6
New price = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Price increase = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
New price = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Price increase = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
New price = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

To find the price after three years, we can use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate (as a decimal), and n is the number of years.

In this case, P = $120, r = 0.05, and n = 3. Plugging in these values, we get:

A = $120(1 + 0.05)^3
A = $120(1.05)^3
A = $120 * 1.157625
A ≈ $139.24

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

Final answer: $139"
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies, we can utilize the concept of division to allocate the total number of pictures among the albums. 

Given that Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and divided them into 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album as follows:

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were designated for selfies, we can calculate the number of selfies by multiplying the number of albums by the number of pictures per album:

3 × 9 = 27

Similarly, as 2 albums were designated for portraits, we can calculate the number of portraits by multiplying the number of albums by the number of pictures per album:

2 × 9 = 18

Therefore, Olivia has 18 portraits and 27 selfies.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the total time James spends reading, we can use the concept of unit rates. We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, so we can express this as a unit rate of pages per minute:

3 pages / 10 minutes = 0.3 pages per minute

Now, we can multiply this unit rate by the total number of pages James reads (18 pages) to find the total time spent reading:

Time = Number of pages / Unit rate
Time = 18 pages / 0.3 pages per minute
Time = 60 minutes

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the current number of guests at the hotel, we can break down the information into steps:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests.
3. 15 guests checked out late, resulting in 76 - 15 = 61 guests remaining.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many guests checked in as those who opted for late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.
5. The total number of guests after the afternoon check-in is 61 + 30 = 91 guests.
6. Finally, 7 more guests checked in after dinner, bringing the total to 91 + 7 = 98 guests.

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the total number of bananas John has, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic addition. 

Let's break down the information provided:

- On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
- On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
- On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which can be expressed as 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, we can calculate the total number of bananas by adding the bananas picked on each day:

Total bananas = 4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday)
Total bananas = 4 + 6 + 12
Total bananas = 22

Therefore, John has 22 bananas."
"To determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, we can break down the problem as follows:

Let's denote the total number of questions as Q. We know that 40% of the questions are easy, so the number of easy questions is 0.4Q. The remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult, so the number of average and difficult questions is (Q - 0.4Q) / 2 = 0.3Q.

We are given that Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 0.4Q = 0.3Q. She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 0.3Q = 0.15Q.

The total number of points Aries is sure to get is the sum of the points from easy, average, and difficult questions:
0.3Q + 0.15Q = 0.45Q

Since we know the total number of questions is 60, we can substitute Q = 60 into the equation:
0.45 * 60 = 27

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 27 points.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as 's' and the number of small stuffed animals sold as '2s', since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

We know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * 4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120, so we can set up the equation: 12s + 4(2s) = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12s + 8s = 120
Combining like terms, we get: 20s = 120

Dividing both sides by 20, we get: s = 6

Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2s = 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic sequences and series. 

The family's daily sandwich consumption can be represented as an arithmetic sequence: 5, 4, 2, ...

The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, the first term (a1) is 5, the last term (an) is 2, and the number of terms (n) is 7 (since we're calculating for 7 days).

First, we need to find the common difference (d) between consecutive terms. Since the sequence decreases by 1 each time, the common difference is -1.

Now, we can calculate the sum of the arithmetic series:

S = 7/2 * (5 + 2)
S = 3.5 * 7
S = 24.5

Therefore, the family eats approximately 24.5 sandwiches in one week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To calculate Suzanne's remaining earnings, we must first determine her total revenue from the sale of cookies and cupcakes. 

Let's break down the problem:

- Revenue from cookies: 80 cookies * $1 per cookie = $80
- Revenue from cupcakes: 60 cupcakes * $4 per cupcake = $240

Total revenue = $80 + $240 = $320

Next, we subtract the amount given to her sisters: $320 - $20 = $300

Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of eggs found by the friends, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

First, we'll subtract the number of eggs found by the twins (30) from the total number of eggs (100). This yields 70 eggs remaining. 

Next, we'll subtract the number of eggs that were not found (10) from the result, which gives us 70 - 10 = 60 eggs.

Therefore, the friends found 60 eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we can break down the problem into manageable components.

First, we establish the daily ore mining capacity of a single dwarf with a steel pickaxe, which is 36 pounds per day. 

Next, we multiply this rate by the number of dwarves, 40, to find the total daily ore mining capacity: 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

Finally, we multiply this result by the number of days in a month, 30, to find the total monthly ore mining capacity: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

Therefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 43200 pounds of ore in a month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43200}$"
"To determine the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can establish a proportionality relationship between the number of sandwiches and the price. Let's denote the unknown price of the package with 8 sandwiches as 'x'. We can set up a proportion based on the given information:

(2 sandwiches) / $3 = (4 sandwiches) / $6 = (8 sandwiches) / x

We can simplify this proportion by cross-multiplying:

2x = 3 * 4
2x = 12

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 2:

x = 12 / 2
x = 6

Therefore, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $6.

Final answer: $6"
"To determine the monthly payment, we can calculate the interest accrued on the remaining balance of $2000. Since Tom is paying 10% per month, we can use the formula for simple interest:

Monthly payment = Principal x Rate

In this case, the principal is $2000 and the rate is 10% or 0.10. Plugging in these values, we get:

Monthly payment = $2000 x 0.10
Monthly payment = $200

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

The final answer is: $200"
"To determine the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we can break down the problem into several steps.

First, we need to calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. This can be found by taking 40% of the initial number of red balloons.

Let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst: 40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons.

Next, we need to find the number of red balloons remaining. This can be done by subtracting the number of red balloons that burst from the initial number of red balloons.

Number of red balloons remaining = Initial number of red balloons - Number of red balloons that burst
= 25 - 10
= 15

Now, we need to calculate the number of yellow balloons released. Since Sally released half of the yellow balloons, we can find this by dividing the initial number of yellow balloons by 2.

Number of yellow balloons released = Initial number of yellow balloons / 2
= 12 / 2
= 6

To find the number of yellow balloons remaining, we subtract the number of yellow balloons released from the initial number of yellow balloons.

Number of yellow balloons remaining = Initial number of yellow balloons - Number of yellow balloons released
= 12 - 6
= 6

Finally, we need to calculate the number of blue balloons added. Since Sally added 75% of the blue balloons, we can find this by multiplying the initial number of blue balloons by 0.75.

Number of blue balloons added = 0.75 * Initial number of blue balloons
= 0.75 * 8
= 6

To find the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we add the number of red balloons remaining, the number of yellow balloons remaining, and the number of blue balloons added.

Total number of balloons = Number of red balloons remaining + Number of yellow balloons remaining + Number of blue balloons added
= 15 + 6 + 6
= 27

The final answer is 27."
"To determine the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we can employ the concept of complementary probability. The probability of Marcus not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the two mutually exclusive events:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 0.5 (probability of a normal teacher) × 0.6 (probability of not getting an extension) = 0.3
2. The substitute teacher comes in: 0.5 (probability of a substitute teacher) × 0.4 (probability of not getting an extension) = 0.2

The probability of Marcus not having to turn in his homework is 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5.

Now, we can find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework by subtracting the probability of not having to turn in his homework from 1:

1 - 0.5 = 0.5

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.5 × 100 = 50%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 50%.

Final answer: 50%"
"To determine the number of tickets each graduate would receive, we must first calculate the total number of available seats. This can be achieved by subtracting the total number of seats taken by graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we can divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to determine the number of tickets each graduate would receive:
4750 ÷ 950 = 5

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To determine the number of small beans Grandpa can eat, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we establish the ratio of large to medium beans, which is 1:2. This means for every 1 large bean, Grandpa consumes 2 medium beans. Given that 75 large beans are required to satisfy his hunger, we can calculate the number of medium beans as follows:

Medium beans = 2 * Large beans
Medium beans = 2 * 75
Medium beans = 150

Next, we utilize the given conversion rate of 3 small beans to 1 medium bean to find the number of small beans. We can express this relationship as a ratio:

Small beans : Medium beans = 3 : 1

Now, we can calculate the number of small beans by substituting the value of medium beans:

Small beans = Medium beans / 3
Small beans = 150 / 3
Small beans = 50

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans."
"To calculate Melissa's hourly wage after expenses, we can employ the concept of total daily income and subtract the daily parking expenses. 

First, we determine the total daily income after expenses: $15 (daily income) - $3 (parking expenses) = $12 per day.

Next, we calculate the total hours worked: 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours.

Now, we can calculate the hourly wage by dividing the total income after expenses by the total hours worked: $12 / 18 hours = $2 per hour.

Therefore, Melissa's hourly wage after expenses is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To calculate the total amount Ted spent, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic addition. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the books. Since each book costs 16 dollars and Ted buys 3 books, the total cost of the books can be calculated as 3 * 16 = 48 dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs 6 dollars, and Ted buys 3 pencils, so the total cost of the pencils is 3 * 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the books and pencils together to find the overall expenditure. This can be represented as 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Therefore, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars.

66"
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of bottles that can fit along the driveway. Given that the driveway is 24 feet wide and a bottle is placed every 3 feet, we can calculate the total number of bottles as follows:

Total number of bottles = Total length of driveway / Distance between bottles
Total number of bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle
Total number of bottles = 8

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. The time taken to move from one bottle to the next is 5 seconds. Therefore, the total time it will take him to set off all the soda fountains is:

Total time = Number of moves * Time per move
Total time = 7 * 5 seconds
Total time = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

35"
"To determine the number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to calculate the total number of apples and then divide it by the number of apples per pack.

Given:
- Number of apples in one box = 40
- Number of boxes = 2
- Apples per pack = 8

Total number of apples = Number of apples in one box * Number of boxes
= 40 * 2
= 80

Number of packs = Total number of apples / Apples per pack
= 80 / 8
= 10

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

Final answer: 10"
"To determine the remaining amount of money Amor has to buy meat, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she purchased.

The cost of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she bought 2 pounds, so the total cost of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.

The cost of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds, so the total cost of Mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Since Amor started with $50, we can find the remaining amount of money by subtracting the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10.

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To calculate the total amount of money lost from not working while in school, we can use the concept of present value of lost income. The present value of lost income is given by the formula:

PV = ∑(PMT * (1 + r)^n)

where:
PV = present value of lost income
PMT = annual income before college = $25,000
r = annual interest rate (assuming 0% for simplicity, as no interest rate is mentioned)
n = number of years in school = 4 years

PV = $25,000 * (1 + 0)^4
PV = $25,000

However, since Jim's income triples after college, we need to calculate the present value of the lost income at the new income level. The present value of lost income at the new income level is given by:

PV = ∑(PMT * (1 + r)^n)
= $25,000 * (1 + 0.75)^4
= $25,000 * 2.299
= $57,475

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost from not working:

Total amount of loans: 4 years * $50,000 = $200,000
Total amount to earn: $200,000 (loans) + $57,475 (lost income) = $257,475

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new annual income:

Time = Total amount / New annual income
= $257,475 / $75,000
= 3.42 years

Therefore, it would take Jim approximately 3.42 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.42}$"
"To determine the total amount of fabric needed, we must calculate the area of the comforter. The comforter's dimensions are 8 feet by 10 feet, which can be represented as a rectangle. The area of a rectangle is calculated using the formula:

Area = Length x Width

In this case, the area is:
Area = 8 ft x 10 ft
Area = 80 sq ft

Since the comforter is made of two identical pieces, we need to multiply the area by 2 to account for both pieces:
Total fabric needed = 2 x 80 sq ft
Total fabric needed = 160 sq ft

Therefore, Jim needs 160 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we can break down the problem into three parts.

First, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday, which is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Tuesday's delivery = (1/5) * Monday's delivery + 17
= (1/5) * 425 + 17
= 85 + 17
= 102

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday, which is 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Wednesday's delivery = 2 * Tuesday's delivery + 5
= 2 * 102 + 5
= 204 + 5
= 209

Now, we add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:

Total delivery = Monday's delivery + Tuesday's delivery + Wednesday's delivery
= 425 + 102 + 209
= 736

The final answer is: $\boxed{736}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the catering, we can apply the principle of multiplication to determine the cost of each type of salad and then sum the results.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person, which can be expressed as 10 × $6.50. This calculation yields a total of $65.

Similarly, the cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person, which can be expressed as 6 × $6. This calculation yields a total of $36.

To find the overall cost, we add the costs of the two salads: $65 + $36 = $101.

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To calculate the average amount lost, we need to determine the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

Let's break down the information given:

1. The amount lost in the first race is $5.
2. The amount won in the second race is $1 more than twice the amount lost in the first race, which is 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.
3. The amount lost in the third race is 1.5 times the amount won in the second race, which is 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, we can calculate the total amount lost:
Total amount lost = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average amount lost, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
Average amount lost = Total amount lost / Number of races
= $21.5 / 3
= $7.17

The final answer is $7.17."
"To calculate the total population of South America, we can employ a straightforward multiplication principle. Given that each country has 5 cities with a population of 1000 individuals, we can break down the calculation as follows:

Let's denote the number of countries as 'n', the number of cities per country as 'c', and the population per city as 'p'. The total population (T) can be calculated using the formula:

T = n * c * p

In this scenario, n = 26 (number of countries in South America), c = 5 (number of cities per country), and p = 1000 (population per city).

T = 26 * 5 * 1000
T = 130,000

Therefore, the total population of South America is 130,000.

The final answer is: 130,000"
"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we can calculate their new heights and then subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height.

Xavier's new height is 4 feet 3 inches, which can be converted to inches as follows: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot + 3 inches = 51 inches.

Cole's new height is 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

Now, we can find the difference in height by subtracting Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

Therefore, the difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 1 inch."
"To determine the share of the first person, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount the first person took as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 1760/3

x = 586.67

Therefore, the first person's share is $586.67."
"To determine the total hours worked by each painter, we can break down the problem into manageable components.

First, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since the team worked 3/8 of a day every day for 3 weeks, we can start by converting the fraction to a decimal: 3/8 = 0.375 days.

Next, we multiply the number of days worked (0.375) by the number of days in a week (7) to find the total days worked: 0.375 * 7 = 2.625 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can multiply the total days worked (2.625) by 24 to find the total hours worked: 2.625 * 24 = 63 hours.

Now, we can divide the total hours worked (63) by the number of painters (4) to find the hours worked per painter: 63 ÷ 4 = 15.75 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15.75}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

The number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4, and in the third set is x/2. The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding and combining like terms, we get:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To calculate the price of the car in 2010, we can use the formula for exponential decay:

A = P(1 - r)^n

where:
A = final value
P = initial value ($20,000)
r = annual depreciation rate (21% or 0.21)
n = number of years (3, since we're calculating for 2010, starting from 2007)

A = 20,000(1 - 0.21)^3
A = 20,000(0.79)^3
A = 20,000(0.631441)
A = 12,688.82

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $12,688.82.

12,688.82"
"To determine the number of Spanish books, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the proportion of books written in languages other than English and German.

First, we calculate the combined proportion of English and German books: 0.5 (English) + 0.1 (German) = 0.6.

Since the remaining proportion represents the Spanish books, we subtract this value from 1: 1 - 0.6 = 0.4.

Now, we multiply this proportion by the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: 0.4 * 50 = 20.

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is 20."
"To determine the remaining distance Bernice needs to drive, we can subtract the distance she has already covered (325 kilometers) from the total distance to New York City (1955 kilometers).

Let's perform the calculation:

Distance remaining = Total distance - Distance covered
= 1955 km - 325 km
= 1630 km

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers to reach New York City.

Final answer: 1630"
"To calculate the total amount of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we can utilize the concept of unit conversion. Given that there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can set up a proportion to find the total amount of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days.

Let's denote the total amount of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days as x gallons. We can set up the following proportion:

8 cups/day × 30 days = x gallons

To solve for x, we can multiply the number of cups per day by the number of days:

8 × 30 = 240 cups

Now, we can convert the total number of cups to gallons by dividing by 16:

240 cups ÷ 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

The final answer is 15."
"To calculate the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we can break down the sequence of events as follows:

Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, increasing the total to 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and 100 people board the train. The net change is -50 + 100 = 50, so the total becomes 140 + 50 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train, decreasing the total to 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

Final answer: $\boxed{110}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the athletic gear, we can break down the costs as follows:

The tank top costs $10.
The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so their cost is $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes are on sale for half price, which means they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The athletic socks originally cost $8, but Alison has a coupon for $2 off, so the final cost is $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To calculate the total cost of the tiles, we need to determine the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. 

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet. 

To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area by the area of each tile: 

Area of kitchen floor / Area of each tile = Total number of tiles
200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile to find the total cost:
Total number of tiles * Cost per tile = Total cost
200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

Therefore, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To calculate the total yearly cost of James' insurance, we can use the following steps:

First, we need to find 60% of the normal cost, which is $120. This can be calculated as:

60% of $120 = 0.6 × $120 = $72

Next, we add the increased cost to the normal cost to find the total monthly cost:

$120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this amount for a month, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12 to find the yearly cost:

$192 × 12 = $2304

Therefore, James pays $2304 per year for his insurance.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To determine the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we can break down the problem into two parts: twin loads and king loads.

Let's calculate the number of loads for each type of bed:

Twin loads per week: 4 beds * 52 weeks = 208 twin loads
Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, we divide the total number of twin loads by 2 to find the number of loads per week: 208 / 2 = 104 twin loads per week

King loads per week: 1 bed * 52 weeks = 52 king loads
Since the laundry machine can wash 1 king set at a time, the number of king loads per week remains the same: 52 king loads per week

Now, we can calculate the total number of loads per week by adding the twin and king loads: 104 + 52 = 156 loads per week

To find the total number of loads per year, we multiply the total number of loads per week by 52 weeks: 156 * 52 = 8,112 loads per year

The final answer is: 8,112"
"To determine the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks, we can break down the calculation into two components: the number of movies watched on Saturdays and the number of movies watched on Sundays.

Let's denote the number of movies watched on Saturday as S and the number of movies watched on Sunday as 0.5S, since they watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.

The total number of movies watched in 4 weeks can be calculated as:

Total movies = (S * 4) + (0.5S * 4)

Combining like terms, we get:

Total movies = 4S + 2S
Total movies = 6S

Since they watch 4 movies on Saturday each week, we can substitute S = 4 into the equation:

Total movies = 6 * 4
Total movies = 24

Therefore, the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we establish the initial number of stickers Leo had two years ago, which is 100. Then, we calculate the number of stickers collected last year, which is 50. 

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, so we multiply the number of stickers collected last year by 2, resulting in 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, we add the stickers from the three years: 100 (initial stickers) + 50 (stickers collected last year) + 100 (stickers collected this year) = 250 stickers.

Therefore, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To determine the number of days the cat food will last, we can use a simple division operation. 

Let's calculate the number of days:

Total cat food available = 720 grams
Daily cat food consumption = 60 grams

Number of days = Total cat food available / Daily cat food consumption
= 720 grams / 60 grams/day
= 12 days

Therefore, the cat food will last for 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as x. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can express Becky's slices as x + 3. Given that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can represent Silvia's slices as 2x.

We are also given that Becky ate 10 slices, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3 = 10

Solving for x, we subtract 3 from both sides:

x = 10 - 3
x = 7

Now that we have found Jake's slices, we can determine Silvia's slices:

Silvia's slices = 2x
Silvia's slices = 2(7)
Silvia's slices = 14

To find the total number of slices eaten, we add the slices eaten by each person:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = (x + 3) + x + 2x
Total slices = 4x + 3
Total slices = 4(7) + 3
Total slices = 28 + 3
Total slices = 31

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Donovan's part as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as x + 18.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:

Betsy's part = x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58

Therefore, Betsy's part of the meal took 58 minutes.

The final answer is 58."
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to break down the costs into individual components and add them together.

The cost of the cast is a fixed amount of $200. The cost of the visit can be calculated by multiplying the hourly rate ($300) by the number of hours spent (0.5 hours), which equals $150. The cost of the painkillers is $4 per pill, and since Hannah needs 30 pills, the total cost is $120. Lastly, the cost of parking is $6 per hour, and with a minimum of 2 hours, the total cost is $12.

Now, let's add these costs together: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To determine the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we can calculate the total number of emails he responds to per day and then multiply it by 5.

First, we need to find the number of emails that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require a response, we can calculate the percentage of emails that do require a response as 100% - 20% = 80%.

Now, we can find the number of emails that require a response by multiplying the total number of emails (80) by the percentage of emails that require a response (0.8):

80 * 0.8 = 64

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, we can multiply this number by 5 to find the total number of emails he responds to in a 5-day work week:

64 * 5 = 320

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To determine the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic sequences. 

Let's break down the information provided:

- On Monday, 32 classes visited.
- On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited, which is 2 * 32 = 64 classes.
- On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, which is 3 * 32 = 96 classes.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

To find the total number of classes, we can sum the classes from each day: 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25.

Using the commutative and associative properties of addition, we can rearrange the terms for easier calculation: (32 + 64 + 96) + (30 + 25).

First, calculate the sum within the parentheses: 32 + 64 = 96, 96 + 96 = 192, 30 + 25 = 55.

Now, add the results: 192 + 55 = 247.

Therefore, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center is 247.

The final answer is: $\boxed{247}$"
"To calculate the average score, we can utilize the formula for the mean, which is the sum of all scores divided by the number of scores. In this case, we have:

Score 1: 100
Score 2: 100
Score 3: 100
Score 4: 80

The sum of these scores is 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380.

To find the average, we divide the sum by the number of scores, which is 4. This can be represented as:

Average = (100 + 100 + 100 + 80) / 4

Using the order of operations, we first calculate the sum within the parentheses:

380 / 4

Dividing 380 by 4 yields:

95

Therefore, the average score is 95."
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which can be calculated as 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

Therefore, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the total cost of postage, we can calculate the cost of mailing each type of coupon separately and then sum the results.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 0.05 = $35.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 0.15 = $210.

The total cost of postage is the sum of these two values: $35 + $210 = $245.

The final answer is: $245"
"To determine the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to calculate the initial number of sub sandwiches ordered by Sidney. Since he ordered 3 less than ten sub sandwiches, we can express this as 10 - 3 = 7.

Next, we need to account for the meatballs in each sub sandwich. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of meatballs in the initial 7 sub sandwiches: 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, so we need to subtract 4 from the initial total: 28 - 4 = 24.

Finally, Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, which means we need to add 3 * 4 = 12 more meatballs to the remaining total: 24 + 12 = 36.

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 36.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we must first calculate the number of trucks that were unable to deliver the fertiliser. Since a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of trucks that could not deliver = (1/4) * Total number of trucks
= (1/4) * 20
= 5

As each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is:
5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons

Now, we can find the total amount of fertiliser that was delivered by subtracting the amount that could not be delivered from the total amount:
Total fertiliser delivered = Total fertiliser - Fertiliser that could not be delivered
= 20 trucks * 20 tons - 100 tons
= 400 tons - 100 tons
= 300 tons

Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To determine the total cost of the butter, we can apply the discount to the total amount of butter needed. Since Dennis requires 6 dozen croissants, he needs 6 pounds of butter. The grocery store offers a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds.

We can calculate the total cost by dividing the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) into groups of 2 pounds. 

6 pounds / 2 pounds per group = 3 groups

Since each group costs 1.5 pounds, the total cost will be:
3 groups x 1.5 pounds per group = 4.5 pounds

The cost per pound of butter is $4.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the total pounds of butter by the cost per pound:
4.5 pounds x $4.00 per pound = $18.00

Therefore, the total cost of purchasing 6 pounds of butter is $18.00."
"To calculate the total cost of the party, we need to determine the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20. 

The total number of guests is 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) - 4 (declined guests) = 41.

Since the initial fee is $125 for 20 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional 21 guests. 

The cost for additional guests = 21 * $6 = $126.

Total cost = Initial fee + Cost for additional guests = $125 + $126 = $251.

Therefore, the total cost of the party is $251."
"To determine the initial amount of money Maggie and Riza had, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of money they had as 'x'. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is 2x. We know that Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4x, and Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3x. The total amount they spent is 1/4x + 1/3x. 

We can set up the equation: 1/4x + 1/3x = 2x - 60

To solve for x, we need to find a common denominator for 1/4 and 1/3, which is 12. Multiply both sides of the equation by 12 to eliminate the fractions:

3x + 4x = 24x - 720

Combine like terms:

7x = 24x - 720

Subtract 24x from both sides:

-17x = -720

Divide both sides by -17:

x = 42.35

Since x represents the initial amount of money they had, we can calculate the total amount of money they had: 2x = 2 * 42.35 = 84.70

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money they spent: 1/4x + 1/3x = 1/4(42.35) + 1/3(42.35) = 10.59 + 14.12 = 24.71

The total amount of money they have left is 84.70 - 24.71 = 59.99

The two of them have $59.99 left."
"To determine the daily banana consumption of the third monkey, we can start by calculating the total weekly consumption of the first two monkeys. 

Let's denote the number of bananas eaten by the first monkey as x. Since the second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, the second monkey's banana consumption can be represented as x + 4. 

The total weekly consumption of the first two monkeys is 7 times the sum of their individual consumption, which is 7(x + x + 4). 

We know that the total weekly consumption of all three monkeys is 315 bananas. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

7(x + x + 4) = 315

Combine like terms:
14x + 28 = 315

Subtract 28 from both sides:
14x = 287

Divide both sides by 14:
x = 20.5

Now that we know the first monkey eats 20.5 bananas per day, we can find the second monkey's daily consumption:
x + 4 = 20.5 + 4 = 24.5 bananas per day.

The total daily consumption of the first two monkeys is 20.5 + 24.5 = 45 bananas.

Since the total weekly consumption of all three monkeys is 315 bananas, the third monkey's daily consumption can be found by subtracting the total daily consumption of the first two monkeys from the total weekly consumption:
315 - 45 = 270 bananas per week.

Divide the weekly consumption by 7 to find the daily consumption of the third monkey:
270 ÷ 7 = 38.57 bananas per day.

The final answer is 38.57."
"To determine the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first half of the 500-piece puzzle and the second 500-piece puzzle.

First, we calculate the number of pieces in the first half of the 500-piece puzzle: 500 / 2 = 250 pieces.

Next, we add the number of pieces in the second puzzle: 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

Therefore, Teddy placed a total of 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.

Final answer: $\boxed{750}$"
"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then subtract that from the amount of money she has.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses:
15 roses * $2 per rose = $30

Since a dozen roses cost $15, we can also calculate the cost of 15 roses as follows:
15 roses / 12 = 1.25 dozen
1.25 dozen * $15 per dozen = $18.75

Now, let's subtract the cost of the roses from the amount of money Jenny has:
$25 - $30 = -$5 (she doesn't have enough money)

Since she can't pay with less than $0, we need to recalculate the cost of the roses in terms of dozens:
15 roses / 12 = 1.25 dozen
1.25 dozen * $15 per dozen = $18.75

However, since she can't pay with less than $0, we need to consider an alternative approach. Let's calculate the cost of the roses in terms of individual roses:
15 roses * $2 per rose = $30

Since she has $25, which is less than the cost of the roses, she will need to pay the florist with a combination of dollars and quarters. To find out how many quarters she will leave with, we need to calculate the remaining amount after paying with the available dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Terry makes is $162."
"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we can break down the problem into manageable intervals.

Let's denote the arrival time of each train as follows:

- T1: Arrival time of the first train
- T2: Arrival time of the second train
- T3: Arrival time of the third train
- T4: Arrival time of the fourth train

We know the following:

1. T1 = 10 minutes
2. T2 = T1 + 30 minutes = 10 + 30 = 40 minutes
3. T3 = T2 + 60 minutes = 40 + 60 = 100 minutes
4. T4 = T3 + 20 minutes = 100 + 20 = 120 minutes

Now, we can calculate the waiting time for each train:

- Waiting time for the first train: T1 - T1 = 0 minutes (no waiting time)
- Waiting time for the second train: T2 - T1 = 40 - 10 = 30 minutes
- Waiting time for the third train: T3 - T2 = 100 - 40 = 60 minutes
- Waiting time for the fourth train: T4 - T3 = 120 - 100 = 20 minutes

The total waiting time for Paul is the sum of the waiting times for each train:

Total waiting time = 0 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 110 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks, we can use the concept of unit rates. We know that Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week and needs 80 more toothpicks. 

First, we can calculate the number of weeks it will take to collect the remaining toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks needed (80) by the rate at which Melanie saves toothpicks per week (10).

Let's set up a proportion to represent the situation:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = x weeks

To solve for x, we can divide 80 by 10.

80 ÷ 10 = 8

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we can calculate the difference between the original price and the sale price, then divide by the original price and multiply by 100.

Let's denote the original price as P. The sale price is 75% of P, which can be expressed as 0.75P. Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * 0.75P = 0.9P.

The discount is the difference between the original price and the sale price, which is P - 0.9P = 0.1P. To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100: (0.1P / P) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is 10%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can utilize the concept of unit rates and multiplication.

First, we establish the rate at which one spring creates jellyfish per hour. Since a jellyfish is created every second, and there are 3600 seconds in an hour, the rate of one spring is 1 jellyfish/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 jellyfish/hour.

Now, we multiply this rate by the number of springs to find the combined rate: 5 springs * 3600 jellyfish/hour = 18,000 jellyfish/hour.

To find the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours, we multiply the combined rate by the time: 18,000 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72,000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

"To determine Frankie's score, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Binkie's score as 'B' and Frankie's score as 'F'. According to the problem, Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's. This can be represented by the equation:

F = 2B + 15

We are given that Binkie's score is 90. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

F = 2(90) + 15
F = 180 + 15
F = 195

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195."
"To determine the total time it took James to reach the store, we must consider the total distance traveled and his walking speed.

The total distance James walked is 4 miles (to the store) + 4 miles (back home) = 8 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the cost-effectiveness of buying bananas in bunches versus individually, we can apply basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the number of bunches as 'n' and the cost per bunch as 'c'. The cost of buying 'n' bunches individually is given by n * c, while the cost of buying 'n' bunches is given by n * c_b, where c_b is the cost per bunch.

Given that the cost per bunch is $0.80 and the cost of buying a bunch is $3.00, we can calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches individually and in bunches.

Cost of buying 10 bunches individually: 10 * $0.80 = $8.00
Cost of buying 10 bunches: 10 * $3.00 = $30.00

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
$8.00 - $30.00 = -$22.00

Since the result is negative, it indicates that buying in bunches is more expensive than buying individually. However, we are interested in the amount saved. To find this, we take the absolute value of the result:
|-$22.00| = $22.00

The final answer is: $22.00"
"To determine the amount of fence left over for Sam, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam receives as x. Since Harry receives 60 feet more than Sam, Harry's share can be expressed as x + 60.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtracting 60 from both sides yields:

2x = 40

Dividing both sides by 2 results in:

x = 20

Now, to find the amount of fence left over for Sam, we subtract his share from the total length:

100 - 20 = 80

Therefore, the amount of fence left over for Sam is 80 feet."
"To determine the total growth of the crocodile in 13 years, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can establish a growth rate of 2 inches per year.

The formula for linear growth is:

Total growth = growth rate × number of years

Substituting the given values, we get:

Total growth = 2 inches/year × 13 years
Total growth = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

The final answer is: 26"
"To calculate Marcel's total earnings, we can break down the problem into manageable components. Let's start by finding the number of each type of bike sold.

First, we know that half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes. This can be represented as:

Number of Trekking bikes = Total bikes * 0.5
= 300 * 0.5
= 150

Next, we're told that 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. This can be represented as:

Number of BMX bikes = Total bikes * 0.15
= 300 * 0.15
= 45

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total:

Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - (Number of Trekking bikes + Number of BMX bikes)
= 300 - (150 + 45)
= 300 - 195
= 105

Now that we have the number of each type of bike sold, we can calculate the total earnings:

Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes * Price of Trekking bike
= 150 * $450
= $67,500

Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes * Price of BMX bike
= 45 * $250
= $11,250

Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes * Price of MTB bike
= 105 * $500
= $52,500

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
= $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500
= $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field, we can employ a simple subtraction approach. 

Let's calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the truck. The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, while the truck collects 3 bales per hour. 

The total number of bales made in 6 hours is the sum of the bales produced by the farmer and the truck: 5 * 6 + 3 * 6 = 30 + 18 = 48.

However, since the question asks for the number of bales left in the field, we need to subtract the total number of bales collected from the total number of bales made. 

The correct calculation is: 48 - 18 = 30.

Therefore, 30 bales of hay are left in the field.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total hours John spends learning per week, we must first calculate the total minutes he spends in class and on extra learning activities.

John attends 5 classes per day, with each class lasting 40 minutes. Therefore, the total minutes spent in class per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since John attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes spent in class per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

In addition to his class time, John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday on extra learning activities. To find this amount, we calculate 1/16 of 1000 minutes:

(1/16) * 1000 = 1000/16 = 62.5 minutes

Now, we add the total minutes spent in class and on extra learning activities to find the total minutes spent learning per week:

1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60:

1062.5 ÷ 60 = 17.6875 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{17.6875}$"
"To determine the height of the ball on its second bounce, we can apply the concept of exponential decay. Given that the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its previous height with each bounce, we can model this situation using the formula:

h_n = h_0 * (2/3)^n

where h_n is the height after the nth bounce, h_0 is the initial height, and n is the number of bounces.

In this case, the initial height (h_0) is 3 stories, which is equivalent to 3 * 24 = 72 feet. We want to find the height after the second bounce, so n = 2.

Plugging in the values, we get:

h_2 = 72 * (2/3)^2
h_2 = 72 * (4/9)
h_2 = 32

Therefore, the ball will go 32 feet on its second bounce.

"To determine the height of the fourth child, we can apply a series of arithmetic operations to the heights of the preceding children.

Let's denote the height of the first child as H1, the second child as H2, the third child as H3, and the fourth child as H4.

Given:
H1 = 6 feet = 72 inches
H2 = H1 + 2 inches = 72 + 2 = 74 inches
H3 = H2 - 5 inches = 74 - 5 = 69 inches
H4 = H3 + 3 inches = 69 + 3 = 72 inches

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To calculate the total earnings, we can utilize the formula for calculating revenue, which is the product of the number of units sold and the price per unit. In this scenario, the number of units sold is 2000 apples, and the price per unit is $5.

Revenue = Number of units sold * Price per unit
Revenue = 2000 * $5
Revenue = $10,000

Therefore, the orchard earned $10,000.

The final answer is $10,000."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward approach using algebra. Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as 'x'. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of this amount, which can be expressed as x/2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, resulting in (x/2)/2 = x/4. Finally, the Allosaurus consumed the remaining 270 kilograms.

We can set up the equation: x/4 = 270

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4: x = 270 × 4

x = 1080

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

Final answer: 1080"
"To determine the total area to be painted, we must calculate the area of each wall and sum them together. The north and south walls are 10 feet in length and 8 feet in width, so their combined area is 2 * (10 * 8) = 160 square feet. The east and west walls are 5 feet in length and 8 feet in width, so their combined area is 2 * (5 * 8) = 80 square feet. The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is 12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To calculate the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the number of shaken cans and the total number of cans available.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, 3 of which were shaken. After Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, there were 11 sodas remaining. Her brother then took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas. 

Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 5 unshaken sodas. The friend can choose from 7 remaining sodas. The probability of the friend getting a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans, which is 2/7.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(2/7) * 100 = 28.57%

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 28.57%."
"To determine the distance between the two trains, we can apply the concept of relative motion. Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we can add their individual distances traveled to find the total distance between them.

Let's denote the speed of the first train as v1 = 60 miles per hour and the speed of the second train as v2 = 30 miles per hour. The time elapsed is t = 3 hours.

The distance traveled by the first train is given by the formula:
d1 = v1 * t = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles

The distance traveled by the second train is given by the formula:
d2 = v2 * t = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

The total distance between the two trains is the sum of their individual distances:
d_total = d1 + d2 = 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

Therefore, the distance between the two trains after 3 hours is 270 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to work and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per day.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since you can't take a fraction of a day off, we'll round down to 6 days.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help (25) by the number of people he can help per day (6):

25 * 6 = 150

Therefore, Billy can help 150 people.

Final answer: 150"
"To determine the total number of people inside the church, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the number of individuals accommodated by the vehicles and subtracting this from the total number of attendees.

First, let's calculate the total number of people in the buses and cars. We have 12 buses, each carrying 35 people, and 20 cars, each carrying 3 people.

Number of people in buses = 12 * 35 = 420
Number of people in cars = 20 * 3 = 60

Total number of people in vehicles = 420 + 60 = 480

Since the problem states that there were 20 private cars and 12 buses parked outside the church, we can assume that these are the only vehicles present. Therefore, the total number of people inside the church is the difference between the total number of people and the number of people in the vehicles.

Total number of people = Total number of people in vehicles + Number of people inside the church
Let x be the number of people inside the church.
480 + x = Total number of people

However, we are not given the total number of people. We can infer that the total number of people is the sum of the people in the vehicles and the people inside the church. Since we are not given the total number of people, we can assume that the total number of people is equal to the sum of the people in the vehicles and the people inside the church.

Total number of people = 480 + x

Since we cannot determine the exact number of people inside the church, we cannot provide a numerical value for the total number of people. However, we can express the total number of people in terms of x.

The final answer is: $\boxed{480 + x}$"

J = M + 10

Now, we can substitute the value of M into the equation for J:
J = 20 + 10
J = 30

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the time it takes to ride each waterslide, we can apply the formula: time = distance / speed.

For the biggest slide, the time is 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes.

For the second biggest slide, the time is 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.

The difference in time between the two slides can be calculated by subtracting the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest waterslide.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we can simply add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours by dividing by 60:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Now, we multiply the total time per day by the number of days (5) to find the total time spent:
1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours over 5 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the distance run by Ahito, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the distance run by Ahito as 'x'. We know that the total distance run by all three individuals is 52 miles, and Amber ran 8 miles. Additionally, Micah ran 3.5 times the distance run by Amber.

We can set up the following equation:

8 + 3.5A + x = 52

Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance run by Amber, we can rewrite the equation as:

8 + 3.5A + x = 52

We also know that A = 8 (Amber's distance). Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

8 + 3.5(8) + x = 52

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 + 28 + x = 52

Combine like terms:

36 + x = 52

Subtract 36 from both sides:

x = 16

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we must consider the initial charge, the return of the item, and the subsequent purchases.

First, we calculate the initial charge: $85.00.

Next, we subtract the returned item: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Now, we calculate the discount on the frying pan: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. The price after the discount is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

We also calculate the discount on the set of towels: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. The price after the discount is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

The total cost of the new purchases is $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $70.00 (previous balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00.

The final answer is: $113.00"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as x.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of these large jellyfish change color, which means the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which implies that the number of large jellyfish that changed color is 6. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

Multiplying both sides by 15, we get:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

Final answer: 90"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Chris's age as C, Ben's age as B, and Caroline's age as A.

Given that Chris is 4 years old, we can write an equation for Ben's age: B = 2C
Since C = 4, we can substitute this value into the equation for Ben's age: B = 2(4) = 8

Now, we can write an equation for Caroline's age: A = 3B
Substituting the value of B, we get: A = 3(8) = 24

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her annual savings and annual expenses.

Lauren's annual savings is 20% of her current salary, which is $20,000. However, this is not possible since she spends $40,000 per year. Let's assume the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income, not 20% of her expenses.

Lauren's annual income is $100,000. 20% of $100,000 is $20,000. Since Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current salary, she will spend $40,000 per year.

"To determine the length of each final cut, we can apply the concept of successive divisions. 

First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4): 100 cm ÷ 4 = 25 cm per part.

Next, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be divided into (5): 25 cm ÷ 5 = 5 cm per final cut.

Therefore, the length of each final cut is 5 cm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total number of students in the school, we can set up a proportion based on the given information. Since 40% of the students are boys, we can express this as a decimal: 0.4. We are told that this 40% represents 240 students. 

Let's denote the total number of students as x. We can then write the equation:

0.4x = 240

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 600, and the number of girls is 360.

The final answer is: 360"

"To calculate the average height of heels at the party, we can use the formula for the mean:

Mean = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)

In this case, the sum of all values is the total height of all heels, and the number of values is the total number of heels.

Let's calculate the total height of all heels:

Total height of 4-inch heels: 3 x 4 = 12 inches
Total height of 2-inch heels: 3 x 2 = 6 inches
Total height of all heels: 12 + 6 = 18 inches

Now, we can calculate the mean:

Mean = (18) / (6)
Mean = 3 inches

Therefore, the average height of heels at the party is 3 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the additional miles Soledad needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time, we can divide the total number of miles she wants to hike (9,300) by the number of days in June (30).

Let's perform the calculation:

9,300 miles ÷ 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we can find the additional miles she needs to hike per day by subtracting this value from the required daily amount.

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

Therefore, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final answer: $\boxed{185}$"
"To calculate the total amount the store will receive, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic series. 

First, let's calculate the total revenue from each color of balls:

Red balls: 3 * $9 = $27
Blue balls: 11 * $5 = $55
Green balls: 25 * $3 = $75

Now, we can sum these values to determine the total revenue:

$27 + $55 + $75 = $157

Therefore, the store will receive a total of $157 after all the balls are sold."
"To determine the amount of apples left for Jacques, we must first calculate the total amount of apples taken by Pierre and Paul. 

Pierre's share is 1/4 of 12 kg, which can be calculated as:

(1/4) × 12 kg = 3 kg

Paul's share is 1/3 of 12 kg, which can be calculated as:

(1/3) × 12 kg = 4 kg

The combined share of Pierre and Paul is 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg.

To find the amount left for Jacques, we subtract the combined share from the total:

12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg

Therefore, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the temperature in the morning, we can apply the concept of temperature change. The initial temperature was 2 degrees Celsius, and it dropped by 8 degrees Celsius overnight. This means the temperature became 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius.

Then, the temperature increased by 3 degrees Celsius in the morning. To find the final temperature, we add the increase to the temperature after the drop:

Temperature in the morning = Temperature after drop + Increase
= -6 + 3

"To determine the amount of money Raymond has left, we can apply the principle of subtraction. 

Initially, Raymond had $21. He then added $11 to this amount, resulting in a total of $21 + $11 = $32. After spending $5 on a comic book, the new total is $32 - $5 = $27. Finally, after spending $19 on a puzzle, the amount of money Raymond has left is $27 - $19 = $8.

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left.

"To determine the cost of each book, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of each book as 'x'. Since Anna bought 2 books, the total cost of the books is 2x. We know that the total amount she had initially was $16, and she spent $4 initially, leaving her with $12. After buying the books, she had $2 left. This can be represented by the equation:

$12 - 2x = $2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = $10

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = $5

Therefore, each book cost $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"To calculate the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year, we can use the concept of percentage increase. The formula for finding the number of students this year is:

Number of students this year = Number of students last year + (Number of students last year * Percentage increase)

Given that the number of students last year is 50 and the percentage increase is 20%, we can plug in the values as follows:

Number of students this year = 50 + (50 * 0.20)
= 50 + 10
= 60

Therefore, the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year is 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we can utilize the concept of rate and proportionality. 

Given that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can establish a rate of blinks per minute as follows:

Rate = Number of blinks / Time = 255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute

Now, we can use this rate to calculate the time required for the light to blink 459 times:

Time = Number of blinks / Rate = 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute

Time = 9.00 minutes

Therefore, it will take the light approximately 9.00 minutes to blink 459 times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9.00}$"
"To determine the difference between the total number of female fish and male fish, we can calculate the total number of each type of fish after Tate's purchase.

Let's denote the initial number of male guppies as M_g, female guppies as F_g, male goldfishes as M_gf, and female goldfishes as F_gf. The initial quantities are:

M_g = 4
F_g = 7
M_gf = 3
F_gf = 5

Tate buys 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes. The updated quantities are:

M_g = M_g + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
F_g = F_g + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8
M_gf = M_gf + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5
F_gf = F_gf + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8

Now, we can calculate the total number of male and female fish:

Total male fish = M_g + M_gf = 6 + 5 = 11
Total female fish = F_g + F_gf = 8 + 8 = 16

The difference between the total number of female fish and male fish is:

Difference = Total female fish - Total male fish = 16 - 11 = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total time taken by Amalia, Megan, and Dior to complete their chores, we can analyze the given information as follows:

Let's denote the time taken by Amalia as A, Megan as M, and Dior as D. We know that:

A = 4 hours (time taken by Amalia to mow the lawn)

M = A + 2 (time taken by Megan to walk the dog, which is 2 hours longer than Amalia)

D = A + 4 + k (time taken by Dior to do laundry, which is over 4 hours longer than Amalia)

We can rewrite the equation for D as D = A + 4 + k. Since we don't know the exact value of k, we can express D in terms of A:

D = A + 4 + k

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation for D:

D = 4 + 4 + k
D = 8 + k

We also know that M = A + 2. Substituting the value of A:

M = 4 + 2
M = 6

Now, we can find the total time taken by adding the individual times:

Total time = A + M + D
= 4 + 6 + (8 + k)
= 18 + k

Since we don't know the value of k, we cannot determine the exact total time. However, we can express the total time in terms of k.

The total time taken by Amalia, Megan, and Dior to complete their chores is 18 + k hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18 + k}$"
"To determine the total distance driven by John in a month, we must consider the round-trip distance and his visit frequency. 

The distance to his parents is calculated as the product of the time taken and the speed: 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, the total distance is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Multiplying this by the number of visits per month (2) yields the total monthly distance driven: 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

Therefore, John drives 560 miles per month when visiting his parents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{560}$"
"To determine the distance Brian will walk in 7 days, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can establish a proportion to find Brian's daily walking distance.

Let's denote Brian's daily walking distance as x. The proportion can be set up as follows:

Sofie's daily distance / Brian's daily distance = 2
10 / x = 2

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

10 = 2x
x = 10 / 2
x = 5

Now that we have Brian's daily walking distance, we can calculate the total distance he walks in 7 days:

Brian's total distance = 5 miles/day * 7 days
= 35 miles

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."
"To determine the production rate of the fifth worker, we can start by calculating the total number of toys produced by the first four workers. 

Let's denote the number of toys produced by the fifth worker as x. The total number of toys produced by all five workers is 400. We can set up the equation:

2(6)(10) + 2(4)(10) + x(10) = 400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

120 + 80 + 10x = 400

Combine like terms:

200 + 10x = 400

Subtract 200 from both sides:

10x = 200

Divide both sides by 10:

x = 20

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 20 toys per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we can calculate the weight of each dog and then add them together.

Given that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, we can calculate the weight of Elijah's dogs as follows:

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so its weight is 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so its weight is 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of both dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Therefore, Elijah and Kory's dogs weigh 45 pounds altogether."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach, utilizing the concept of inverse operations to backtrack from the information provided.

Let's denote the initial number of stickers Seth had as 'x'. We know that Luis received half of these stickers, so he had x/2 stickers. After giving half to Kris, Luis had x/4 stickers left. Since Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, Kris initially had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: x/4 = 16. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4, yielding x = 64.

Therefore, Seth initially had 64 stickers.

The final answer is: 64"
"To determine the number of small bags John can make, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's and then divide it by the number of M&M's per small bag.

First, we calculate the total number of M&M's by multiplying the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Total M&M's = 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag * 30 M&M's/ounce
Total M&M's = 3 * 10 * 30
Total M&M's = 900

Now, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag to find the number of small bags.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag
Number of small bags = 900 / 10
Number of small bags = 90

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M's."
"To determine the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can employ the concept of division. 

Given that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can calculate the number of days required to cover half of the earth's circumference by dividing the total distance by his daily distance.

Half of the earth's circumference = 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

Number of days = Total distance / Daily distance
= 20,000 km / 400 km
= 50 days

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the speed of the faster car, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the speed of the average car as A, the speed of the 2nd fastest car as B, and the speed of the faster car as C.

Given that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can express this relationship as:

B = 5A

We are also given that the average car can go 120 mph, so A = 120. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

B = 5(120)
B = 600

Now, we know that the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:

C = 1.25B

Substituting the value of B, we get:

C = 1.25(600)
C = 750

Thus, the faster car can go 750 mph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine Vince's current age, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Vince's current age as 'x'. Two years ago, Vince's age was 'x - 2'. According to the problem, Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age two years ago. We can set up the equation:

Liam's age 2 years ago = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago
14 = 2(x - 2)

Now, we can solve for 'x' by distributing the 2 on the right side of the equation:

14 = 2x - 4

Next, we add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with 'x':

14 + 4 = 2x - 4 + 4
18 = 2x

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x':

18/2 = 2x/2
9 = x

Therefore, Vince's current age is 9.

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We are given that A = M, C + S = 30, and C = S + 12. We can use these equations to solve for the individual values of A, C, and S.

First, we can express C in terms of S: C = S + 12.

Next, we can substitute C = S + 12 into the equation C + S = 30, which gives us (S + 12) + S = 30. Simplifying this, we get 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation, we get 2S = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we find S = 9.

Now that we know S = 9, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives us C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, we know that A = 13.

To find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted, we can calculate C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we can break down the problem into two parts: the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is:

Weight of crayons = Number of crayons * Weight of each crayon
= 200 * 1
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of crayons to pounds:

Weight of crayons (in pounds) = Weight of crayons (in ounces) / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

Next, we need to calculate the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes. So, the total weight of the boxes is:

Weight of boxes = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Converting the weight of boxes to pounds:

Weight of boxes (in pounds) = Weight of boxes (in ounces) / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

Now, we can find the total weight of the crayons and boxes by adding their individual weights:

Total weight = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To calculate the total earnings, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps. 

First, we determine the total number of logs John can create from the tree. Since the tree is 80 feet long and he cuts it into 4-foot logs, we can calculate the number of logs as follows:

80 feet / 4 feet/log = 20 logs

Next, we find the total number of planks by multiplying the number of logs by 5, as each log can be cut into 5 planks:

20 logs * 5 planks/log = 100 planks

Finally, we calculate John's total earnings by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank ($1.2):

100 planks * $1.2/plank = $120

Therefore, John's total earnings from selling the planks are $120."
"To determine the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to calculate their combined salaries.

Valerie's monthly salary is $5000, which is half of her brother's salary. Therefore, her brother's monthly salary is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

Since their mother earns twice their combined salary, her monthly salary is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

Now, let's add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000."
"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk, we can break down the problem into two parts: the time spent walking on the beach and the time spent walking on the sidewalk.

Let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as x miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, we can set up the equation:

2x = 40

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 20 miles per minute

Now that we know Grandma's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is twice her speed on the beach:

Sidewalk speed = 2x = 2(20) = 40 miles per minute

Next, we can calculate the time it takes for Grandma to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 1 mile / 40 miles per minute
= 1/40 minutes per mile

Since Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, it will take her:

1/40 minutes per mile × 1 mile
= 1/40 minutes

Now, we can add the time it takes to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time:

Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
= 40 minutes + 1/40 minutes
= 40 + 1/40
= 40 + 0.025
= 40.025 minutes

Therefore, it takes Grandma approximately 40.025 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40.025}$"
"To determine the number of additional weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we can use the concept of linear growth. Since Jane saves $4 per week, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Let x be the number of weeks it takes to save $60.

The total amount saved is the product of the weekly savings and the number of weeks:
4x = 60

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:
x = 60 ÷ 4
x = 15

However, this represents the total number of weeks it would take to save $60, assuming she starts with $0. Since she has already saved $32, we need to subtract the initial savings from the total:
15 - 8 = 7

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

Final answer: 7"
"To determine the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can employ the principle of addition. We have three distinct scenarios to consider:

- Three trees, each containing 7 blue birds, can be represented as 3 × 7.
- Two trees, each with 4 blue birds, can be represented as 2 × 4.
- One tree, with 3 blue birds, is a straightforward count.

Using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can calculate the total number of blue birds as follows:

3 × 7 + 2 × 4 + 3

First, we'll calculate the products:

3 × 7 = 21
2 × 4 = 8

Now, we'll add the results:

21 + 8 + 3 = 32

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the situation. Let's denote the initial number of marbles Bob has as 'x'. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. 

We can set up the equation: x + 24 = 60

To solve for x, we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: x = 60 - 24
x = 36

Now, we know that Bob initially has 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as x degrees.

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces. The amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount of water from the other mug is 1 ounce. We can set up the following equation:

(4/8) * 33 + (1/8) * x = 40

This equation represents the total amount of water Donny has after pouring from both mugs. We can simplify the equation:

(1/2) * 33 + (1/8) * x = 40

Multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate the fractions:

4 * 33 + x = 320

132 + x = 320

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x = 188

However, this solution is not valid since the temperature of the second mug must be at least 40 degrees. We can re-examine the original equation to find a valid solution.

"To calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of cows and the number of chickens.

Let's start with the cows. The farm initially has 50 cows, and 20 cows are added per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cows added in 3 weeks is:

20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

The initial number of cows is 50, so the total number of cows after 3 weeks is:

50 + 420 = 470 cows

Now, let's calculate the number of chickens. The farm initially has 20 chickens, and 10 chickens are added per day. Again, there are 21 days in 3 weeks, so the total number of chickens added is:

10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

The initial number of chickens is 20, so the total number of chickens after 3 weeks is:

20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 + 230
= 700

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"To determine the cost of each bagel after the discount, we can use the following steps:

First, calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels: 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Next, calculate the discount amount: 10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Finally, divide the final cost by the number of bagels in a pack (9) to find the cost per bagel: $36.00 / 9 = $4.00.

Therefore, the cost of each bagel after the discount is $4.00.

The final answer is: $4.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps.

Let's denote the number of scoops Gomer ate as 's' and the number of potatoes needed for 's' scoops as 'p'. We are given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so s = 23 - 5 = 18.

We are also given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be represented as:

p = (6 - 3) / (3 - 1)
p = 3 / 2
p = 1.5

Now, we know that 1.5 potatoes are needed for 1 scoop. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we multiply 1.5 potatoes by 18 scoops.
p = 1.5 * 18
p = 27

However, we are asked to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, not how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. Since Gomer ate 5 scoops less than 23 scoops, we need to subtract 5 scoops from the total number of scoops Gomer ate.
Total scoops = 23 - 5 = 18
Since we know that 1.5 potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we can find the total number of potatoes Gomer ate by multiplying 1.5 potatoes by 18 scoops.
Total potatoes = 1.5 * 18
Total potatoes = 27

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of eggs consumed in the first 30 days and the number of eggs consumed in the next 30 days.

Let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed in the first 30 days: 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of eggs consumed in the next 30 days: 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we'll add the total number of eggs consumed in both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

To convert the total number of eggs to dozens, we'll divide by 12: 240 eggs / 12 = 20.

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To determine the number of blue jellybeans, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of blue jellybeans as B, the number of green jellybeans as G, and the number of red jellybeans as R. We are given that G = 17 and R = 2G. The total number of jellybeans is 60, so we can set up the equation:

B + G + R = 60

Substituting R = 2G and G = 17, we get:

B + 17 + 2(17) = 60

Simplifying the equation:

B + 17 + 34 = 60

Combine like terms:

B + 51 = 60

Subtract 51 from both sides:

B = 9

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9."
"To calculate the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we can utilize the concept of multiplication. 

The number of trees (T) is 5, and the number of lemons collected per tree (L) is 6. The number of years in a decade (Y) is 10. 

The total number of lemons collected in a decade can be calculated using the formula: Total lemons = T * L * Y

Substituting the given values, we get: Total lemons = 5 * 6 * 10

Total lemons = 300

Therefore, the total number of lemons collected in a decade is 300."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of passengers on the bus is 84, and we need to find the number of women who remained after 20 women alighted from the bus.

First, we can find the total number of parts in the ratio by adding the number of parts for men and women: 5 + 9 = 14.

Next, we can divide the total number of passengers by the total number of parts to find the value of one part: 84 ÷ 14 = 6.

Since the ratio of women is 9 parts, we can multiply 9 by the value of one part to find the initial number of women: 9 × 6 = 54.

Now, we can subtract the number of women who alighted from the bus to find the number of women who remained: 54 - 20 = 34.

Therefore, the number of women who remained on the bus is 34.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the total number of sunflowers sold, we can start by calculating the number of bouquets sold. Given that Faraday earned $56 from the bouquet per day and he sold it for 3 days, the total number of bouquets sold is $56 ÷ $8 = 7.

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold can be found by multiplying the number of bouquets sold by the number of sunflowers per bouquet: 7 * 12 = 84.

Therefore, Faraday sold 84 sunflowers in total.

Final answer: 84"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks and the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory.

Let's assume Adam buys x number of rocks. The cost of the rocks is $5x.

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, the number of rocks sold is 0.6x.

The revenue from selling 0.6x rocks at $7 each is 0.6x * 7 = $4.2x.

The total cost is $5x, and the total revenue is $4.2x. Since Adam invested all his money, the total revenue should be equal to the total cost.

However, this equation doesn't make sense, as the revenue is less than the cost. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Since Adam can't sell all his rocks, let's assume he sells 0.6x rocks and keeps the remaining 0.4x rocks.

The revenue from selling 0.6x rocks is 0.6x * 7 = $4.2x.

The cost of the rocks is $5x, and the cost of the remaining 0.4x rocks is 0.4x * 5 = $2x.

The total cost is $5x + $2x = $7x.

Since Adam invested all his money, the total revenue should be equal to the total cost.

We can set up the equation: 4.2x = 7x

However, this equation doesn't make sense.

Let's re-evaluate the problem again.

Since Adam can't sell all his rocks, let's assume he sells 0.6x rocks and keeps the remaining 0.4x rocks.

"To determine the total number of days required to complete the project, we can calculate the time it takes to complete each type of picture scene and then add them together.

Let's analyze the situation:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since the days for each type of scene are not the same, we need to find the maximum number of days, which is 9 days.

Therefore, the total number of days required to complete the project is 9 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of eggs each child receives, we can utilize the concept of division. In this scenario, we have a total of 36 eggs, which can be expressed as 36. We are dividing this quantity by the number of children, which is 4.

The division operation can be represented as:

36 ÷ 4 = 9

This calculation yields a quotient of 9, indicating that each child will receive 9 eggs."
"To calculate the total cost of food for Jen's fish in May, we can utilize the formula for calculating total cost, which is the product of the number of days and the daily cost per fish.

Let's denote the number of days in May as 'd' and the daily cost per fish as 'c'. We are given that d = 31 and c = $1.

Total cost = d * c
Total cost = 31 * $1
Total cost = $31

Therefore, Jen spends $31 on food for her fish in May."
"To determine the total number of roses Patricia has now, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. 

We start with the initial number of roses, which is 30. Then, we subtract the number of roses given to her mother, 24, and finally add the number of roses she bought, 15.

Using the associative and commutative properties of addition, we can rearrange the expression as follows:

Total number of roses now = (Initial number of roses - Number of roses given to her mother) + Number of roses bought
= (30 - 24) + 15
= 6 + 15
= 21

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses.

Final answer: 21"
"To calculate the average speed, we can utilize the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time.

Given that Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours and an additional 140 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate the total distance and total time as follows:

Total Distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total Time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can apply the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour

Therefore, the average speed is 50 miles per hour."
"In probability theory, we can model the scenario using the multiplication rule for independent events. Let's denote the probability of the first ticket winning as P(A) = 0.2 and the probability of the second ticket winning as P(B) = 0.6, since it's three times more likely to win.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each event: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12\%}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos as x, Jim as y, and Carrey as z.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. This can be expressed as:

y = x + 5

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so we can write:

x = 2z

Since the total number of seashells is the sum of what each person collected, we can set up the equation:

x + y + z = 81

Now we have a system of three equations:

1) y = x + 5
2) x = 2z
3) x + y + z = 81

We can substitute equation (1) into equation (3) to eliminate y:

x + (x + 5) + z = 81

Combine like terms:

2x + z + 5 = 81

Subtract 5 from both sides:

2x + z = 76

Now we can substitute equation (2) into the previous equation:

2(2z) + z = 76

Expand and simplify:

4z + z = 76

Combine like terms:

5z = 76

Divide both sides by 5:

z = 15.2

Now that we know Carrey collected 15.2 seashells, we can find x by substituting z into equation (2):

x = 2z
x = 2(15.2)
x = 30.4

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into equation (1):

y = x + 5
y = 30.4 + 5
y = 35.4

Since the total number of seashells is 81, we can verify that our solution is correct:

x + y + z = 30.4 + 35.4 + 15.2 = 81

Each person got 81 / 3 = 27 seashells.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of carrots Mason consumes on weekdays. Since there are 5 weekdays, and he eats 4 carrots each day, the total number of carrots consumed on weekdays is:

4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

Next, we calculate the total number of carrots Mason consumes on the weekend. There are 2 weekend days, and he eats 5 carrots each day, resulting in:

5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, we add the total number of carrots consumed on weekdays and the weekend to obtain the overall weekly consumption:

20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week."
"To determine the total time of the cassette, we can calculate the length of the second song by finding 60% of the length of the first song and adding it to the length of the first song.

Let's denote the length of the first song as x. The length of the second song is then x + 0.6x, which simplifies to 1.6x.

The total time of the cassette is the sum of the lengths of the two songs:
Total time = x + 1.6x
Total time = 2.6x

Since we know the length of the first song is 5 minutes, we can substitute x = 5 into the equation:
Total time = 2.6 * 5
Total time = 13 minutes

Therefore, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To calculate the total profit, we must first determine the total cost and the total selling price of the mobile devices.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is the sum of these two amounts: $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The selling price of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total selling price is the sum of these two amounts: $40 + $80 = $120.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost: $120 - $120 = $0.

The final answer is: $0"
"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we can analyze the given information using a step-by-step approach.

First, we know that Isabel is 7 feet tall. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can express this as:

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Next, we are told that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. Therefore, we can express Carl's height as:

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Now, we are given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. We can express this as:

Cane length = Carl's height / 2
Cane length = 6 / 2
Cane length = 3 feet

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"To determine the number of additional bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the demand, we can calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Total energy demand of 2300 people = 0.2 * 2300 = 460 people's energy demand
Since each bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the number of bottles needed to cover 460 people's energy demand.

Number of bottles needed = 460 / 0.2
Number of bottles needed = 2300

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the demand.

Additional bottles needed = 2300 - 4200
Additional bottles needed = -1900

However, since we can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the number of bottles needed per day to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Number of bottles per day = 2300 / 0.2
Number of bottles per day = 11500

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, they need to produce more bottles per day to meet the demand.

Additional bottles per day = 11500 - 4200
Additional bottles per day = 7300

To find the total number of additional bottles Hortex needs to produce, we can multiply the additional bottles per day by the number of days they need to produce them.

Total additional bottles = 7300 * 3
Total additional bottles = 21900

The correct answer is: $\boxed{21900}$"
"To determine the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

Let's break down the information provided:

- There are 8 babies in total.
- 3/4 of them are dressed in purple, which equals 6 babies.
- 1/4 of them are dressed in blue, which equals 2 babies.
- 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, which equals 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies.
- The total number of babies wearing bows is 4.

Now, we can calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:

Probability = (number of purple bow wearers) / (total number of bow wearers)
= 2 / 4
= 1/2
= 0.5
= 50%

The probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%."
"To determine the number of reports received on Wednesday, we can utilize the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

Let's denote the total number of reports received as T, the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday as M, the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday as F, and the number of reports received on Wednesday as W.

We are given the following information:

T = 5168
M = 1907
F = 2136

We can express the total number of reports received as the sum of the reports received on each day, minus the overlap between the days. Since we are not given any information about the overlap between Monday and Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, we will assume that there is no overlap between these days.

The total number of reports received on Wednesday can be calculated as:

T = M + F + W

Substituting the given values, we get:

5168 = 1907 + 2136 + W

Simplifying the equation, we get:

5168 = 4043 + W

Subtracting 4043 from both sides, we get:

W = 5168 - 4043
W = 1125

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To determine the total earnings from selling the unused land, we need to calculate the amount earned from each sale and add them together.

Abraham initially sold 40 square meters of land for $50. This can be expressed as:

40 m² × $50/m² = $2000

He then sold another 20 square meters for $30. This can be expressed as:

20 m² × $30/m² = $600

The remaining 20 square meters were sold for $3 per square meter. This can be expressed as:

20 m² × $3/m² = $60

Now, we add the earnings from each sale to find the total amount earned:

$2000 + $600 + $60 = $2660

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn $2660 after selling all his unused land.

The final answer is: $2660"
"To determine Geb's age, we can apply a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Haley's age as H and Geb's age as G. We are given that G = (1/2)H - 10.

We are also given that Haley is 26 years old, so H = 26. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

G = (1/2)(26) - 10
G = 13 - 10
G = 3

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

Final answer: 3"
"To determine the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to establish the daily face mask usage. Given that Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, we can calculate the daily usage as follows:

Daily face mask usage = Number of face mask changes per day * Number of times Tyrion goes out per day
Daily face mask usage = 2 * 3
Daily face mask usage = 6

Now, to find the total number of face masks used every 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:

Total face masks used every 2 days = Daily face mask usage * 2
Total face masks used every 2 days = 6 * 2
Total face masks used every 2 days = 12

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we must first calculate the total number of eggs found by each individual and then subtract that from the initial number of eggs.

Let's denote the number of eggs found by Lamar as L, Stacy as S, Charlie as C, and Mei as M. We are given the following information:

L = 5
S = 2L
C = S - 2
M = C/2

We can express these relationships as equations:

L = 5
S = 2(5) = 10
C = 10 - 2 = 8
M = 8/2 = 4

Now, we can calculate the total number of eggs found:
Total eggs found = L + S + C + M = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27

Since Cole initially hid 3 dozen eggs, which is equivalent to 36 eggs, we can find the number of eggs still hidden by subtracting the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs:
Eggs still hidden = 36 - 27 = 9

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply it by the number of collections per week and the payment per collection.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these complexes is 200 + 200 = 400.
2. The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.
3. The total number of apartments John collects garbage from is 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440.
4. Since he collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1440 * 3 = 4320.
5. He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 4320 * 0.40 = $1728.

Therefore, John's weekly earnings are $1728.

The final answer is: $1728"
"To calculate the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we can break down the problem into individual years and sum up the production.

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * 17150 - 200 = 17100 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 + 0 + 1000 = 52500

The total number of fruits that an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 52500."
"To calculate the amount of money Jack has now, we need to determine 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

1/5 of $100 can be calculated as (1/5) × $100 = $20.

Now, we add this amount to Jack's initial $100:

$100 + $20 = $120

Therefore, Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the lengths of the three ropes. Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We are given that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can express this relationship as:
B = Y - 7

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, which can be written as:
R = 4B

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
Y + B + R = 37

Substituting the expression for B in terms of Y into the third equation, we get:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the amount of money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, we can express this as an equation:

Let R be the amount of money Ronnie was given. Then, Rissa was given 3R.

We know that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money after giving an equal amount to her sister. If we let x be the amount Ronnie gave to her sister, then Rissa is left with 3R - x. Since she is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up the equation:

3R - x = (4/5) * (3R)

To solve for x, we can first simplify the right-hand side of the equation:

3R - x = (12/5)R

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 3R - (12/5)R
x = (15/5)R - (12/5)R
x = (3/5)R

Since Rissa gave her sister x dollars, and we know that x = (3/5)R, we can substitute this value back into the equation for Rissa's remaining money:

Rissa's remaining money = 3R - x
= 3R - (3/5)R
= (15/5)R - (3/5)R
= (12/5)R

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

(12/5)R = (4/5) * 15

To solve for R, we can multiply both sides by 5/4:

R = (4/5) * 15
R = 12

Now that we know Ronnie was given $12, we can find out how much money Ronnie has left:

Ronnie's initial money: $12
Ronnie gave her sister: $3
Ronnie's remaining money: $12 - $3 = $9

The final answer is: $9"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount of each color paint as 'x'. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and half the mural is yellow, we can set up the equation:

2x + x + x = 12

This equation represents the total amount of paint used, where 2x accounts for the equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and x accounts for the yellow paint.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x = 12

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:

x = 3

Since 'x' represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 3 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total area of Tom's house, we must first calculate the area of each room and then sum them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 feet x 12 feet = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 x 240 square feet = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

Therefore, the total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

Final answer: 2440"
"To calculate the total number of clouds Alice counted, we can utilize the concept of a geometric sequence. The number of clouds on each day forms a sequence with a common ratio of 2. The formula for the sum of a geometric sequence is:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where:
- S is the sum of the sequence
- a is the first term (3 clouds on Monday)
- r is the common ratio (2)
- n is the number of terms (5 days)

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S = 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1)
S = 3 * (-31) / (-1)
S = 3 * 31
S = 93

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To determine the number of cycles that can be run for $1, we need to calculate the cost per pod of the new box. 

The new box has 120 pods and costs $12. The cost per pod is $12 / 120 = $0.1 per pod.

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the number of cycles that can be run for $1 is 1 / $0.1 = 10 cycles.

Therefore, you can run 10 cycles for $1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of 5-dollar bills Thomas has, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20-dollar bills, resulting in 50 bills. He then loses 10 bills, leaving him with 40 bills. After using half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, he is left with 20 bills. Tripling his money means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills. Finally, converting all his bills to 5-dollar bills yields 60 * 5 = 300 5-dollar bills.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine the total number of goals scored in the match, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first half and the second half.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals, and team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, which is 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.5}$"
"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he needs to recycle the chalk, we can model the situation using a linear equation. Let's denote the total length of the chalk as L and the number of days as t.

Initially, the teacher has 5 inches of chalk, so L = 5. The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, which can be represented as 0.20L. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, which is 0.45L. Since he recycled the chalk when it was smaller than 2 inches, we can set up an equation to find the remaining chalk:

L - 0.45L = 2.25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.55L = 2.25

Now, we can solve for L:

L = 2.25 / 0.55
L = 4.09 inches

This means the teacher has approximately 4.09 inches of chalk left. To find the number of days it will take to use up the remaining chalk at a rate of 20% per day, we can set up another equation:

0.20L = 0.09L (since 4.09 - 0.09 = 3.99, and 0.20 * 3.99 = 0.798, which is close to 0.09)

However, to maintain precision, we can use the exact value of L:

0.20L = 0.09L

Since we know that 0.09L = 0.09 * 4.09 = 0.3699, we can set up the equation:

0.20L = 0.09L + 0.01L

0.20L - 0.09L = 0.01L
0.11L = 0.01L

This equation is not useful, so we can use the initial equation:

0.55L = 2.25

We can divide both sides by 0.55:

L = 2.25 / 0.55
L = 4.09

Now, we can use the equation:

0.20L = 0.09L + 0.01L

0.20L - 0.09L = 0.01L
0.11L = 0.01L

This equation is not useful, so we can use the initial equation:

0.55L = 2.25

We can divide both sides by 0.55:

L = 2.25 / 0.55
L = 4.09

Now, we can use the equation:

0.20L = 0.09L + 0.01L

0.20L - 0.09L = 0.01L
0.11L = 0.01L

This equation is not useful, so we can use the initial equation:

0.55L = 2.25

We can divide both sides by 0.55:

"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we can utilize the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

First, let's calculate the total number of students on varsity. We know that one-third of the girls and one-fourth of the boys are on varsity. 

Number of girls on varsity = (1/3) * 12 = 4
Number of boys on varsity = (1/4) * 12 = 3

Total number of students on varsity = 4 + 3 = 7

Now, we can find the number of students not on varsity by subtracting the total number of students on varsity from the total number of students in the class.

Total number of students in the class = 12 + 12 = 24

Number of students not on varsity = Total number of students - Total number of students on varsity
= 24 - 7
= 17

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is 17."
"To determine the number of face masks Johnny bought, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of face masks Mike bought as 'm'. According to the problem, Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, which can be expressed as 3m + 2.

We are given that Mike bought 5 face masks, so we can substitute m = 5 into the equation: 3(5) + 2.

First, we calculate 3 times 5, which equals 15. Then, we add 2 to get 17.

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

Final Answer: The final answer is 17."
"To determine the percentage of James' teeth fixed, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the total number of teeth fixed: 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let W represent Wendy's current age and C represent Colin's current age. From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 3:

3C + 75 = W

Now we have two equations and two variables:

W = 5C + 35
3C + 75 = W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

Therefore, Colin's current age is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of books Bob can buy per school, we need to calculate the total number of sets of 100 books he can purchase with $27,000.

First, we'll divide the total amount by the cost of one set of 100 books: $27,000 ÷ $500 = 54 sets.

Next, we'll divide the total number of sets by the number of schools: 54 sets ÷ 3 schools = 18 sets per school.

Since each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find the total number of books per school: 18 sets per school × 100 books per set = 1800 books per school.

Therefore, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1800}$"
"The problem at hand involves a series of events that result in a sequence of apple collections and releases. To determine the total number of apples brought home, we can analyze the situation as a series of additions and subtractions.

Initially, Newton starts with 2 apples. He then adds 5 more apples, resulting in a total of 2 + 5 = 7 apples. After putting one apple in his pocket, he is left with 7 - 1 = 6 apples. Throwing one apple at the tree causes 6 more apples to fall out, bringing the total to 6 + 6 = 12 apples. Finally, he picks up all the remaining apples, which is 12.

Therefore, the total number of apples brought home is 12.

"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we can calculate the total number of slices required and then divide it by the total number of slices per pizza.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, resulting in a total of 10 slices per friend. With 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, the total number of slices per pizza is 12 + 8 = 20. To find the number of pizzas needed, we can divide the total number of slices eaten (60) by the total number of slices per pizza (20).

60 ÷ 20 = 3

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 pizzas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total miles Sam ran this week, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic series. The miles Sam ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday can be represented as an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 0, since the distance remains constant. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:

S = n/2 * (a1 + an)

where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, n = 3 (days), a1 = 3 miles, and an = 3 miles. Plugging in these values, we get:

S = 3/2 * (3 + 3) = 3/2 * 6 = 9 miles

The miles Sam ran on Tuesday and Thursday can be represented as a constant value, 5 miles, multiplied by 2 days. Therefore, the total miles for these two days is:

5 miles * 2 days = 10 miles

Now, we can add the miles from both sets of days to find the total miles Sam ran this week:

Total miles = 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the time it takes Jay to build 60 snowballs, we can use the concept of net change. Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour but loses 2 snowballs every 15 minutes. 

First, let's calculate the net change in snowballs per hour. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, the total number of snowballs lost per hour is 2 * 4 = 8. 

The net change in snowballs per hour is 20 - 8 = 12.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Total Snowballs / Net Change per Hour.

Time = 60 / 12

Time = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to build 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine Jim's age, we can utilize the given information that John is twice as old as Jim. This can be expressed as an equation:

Let J = Jim's age
J = 2J

However, this equation is not accurate, as it implies Jim's age is twice John's age, which contradicts the given information. Instead, we can rephrase the problem as:

Let J = Jim's age
J = 1/2 * John's age

Given John's age is 28, we can substitute this value into the equation:

J = 1/2 * 28
J = 14

Therefore, Jim's age is 14."
"To determine the total number of slices eaten, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

Let's denote the number of slices Doxa ate as D, the number her sister ate as S, and the number her brother ate as B. We are given the following information:

1. D = 1
2. S = D + 1
3. B = S + 1

We can express S and B in terms of D:
S = D + 1
B = (D + 1) + 1
B = D + 2

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding D, S, and B:
Total slices = D + S + B
Total slices = D + (D + 1) + (D + 2)
Total slices = 3D + 3

Substituting D = 1:
Total slices = 3(1) + 3
Total slices = 3 + 3
Total slices = 6

Therefore, the total number of slices eaten is 6."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to represent the situation. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. This means they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had x + 12 bandages from the first day, so they had x + 12 + 28 = x + 40 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had x + 40 - 25 = x + 15 bandages left.

We are given that they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation:

x + 15 = 78

Subtracting 15 from both sides gives us:

x = 63

Therefore, the nurses started with 63 bandages on the first day.

The final answer is: 63"
"To calculate the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to determine the length of her hair and then apply the respective costs.

The initial length of her hair is 10 inches, and the final length is 8 inches. The difference in length is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 x $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is $40. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color: $60 + $40 = $100.

Therefore, the total cost of May's haircut and color is $100."
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we can break down the problem into two components: her hourly earnings and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her total hours worked in April. Since there are 4 weeks in April and she works 7.5 hours a day, we can multiply the number of hours worked per day by the number of days worked per week and then by the number of weeks:

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks
= 7.5 * 6 * 4
= 180 hours

Next, we can calculate her total earnings from her hourly rate by multiplying the total hours worked by her hourly rate:

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour
= $270

Since Jen has complete attendance, she receives an additional $10. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:

Total earnings = $270 + $10
= $280

The final answer is: $280"
"To calculate Jason's total earnings, we can apply the principle of arithmetic addition. 

First, we multiply the number of times Jason emptied the dishwasher by the corresponding weekly rate: 6 * $0.50 = $3.00. 

Next, we calculate the earnings from doing laundry: 1 * $3.00 = $3.00. 

Then, we find the earnings from taking the trash out: 2 * $0.75 = $1.50. 

Lastly, we calculate the earnings from cleaning the room: 1 * $1.50 = $1.50.

Now, we add these amounts together: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00.

The final answer is: $8.00"

Let's denote the number of people who entered in the morning as M, the number of people who entered at 10:00 as T, and the number of people who entered by evening as E.

We are given the following information:

M = 50 (number of people who entered in the morning)
T = 40 (number of people who entered at 10:00)
E = 3T (number of people who entered by evening, which is three times the number of people who entered at 10:00)

We can express the total number of people who entered the restaurant as the sum of the people who entered in each period:

Total = M + T + E
= 50 + 40 + 3(40)
= 50 + 40 + 120
= 210

Therefore, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 210.

The final answer is: $\boxed{210}$"
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the number of red pens: 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 pens.

Next, we calculate the number of black pens, which is twice the amount of red pens: 2 * 25 pens = 50 pens.

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens to find the total: 25 pens + 50 pens = 75 pens.

Therefore, Alain has a total of 75 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the total cost of John's purchases, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac.

First, we calculate the cost of the scotch. The total cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:

Cost per bottle of scotch = Total cost ÷ Number of bottles
= $600 ÷ 10
= $60 per bottle

Next, we calculate the cost of the cognac. The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. To find the cost of the cognac per bottle, we multiply the cost of the scotch by 1.5 (100% + 50%):

Cost per bottle of cognac = Cost per bottle of scotch × 1.5
= $60 × 1.5
= $90 per bottle

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, the number of bottles of cognac is 2 × 10 = 20.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the cognac:
Total cost of cognac = Number of bottles of cognac × Cost per bottle of cognac
= 20 × $90
= $1800

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the overall total cost:
Total cost = Total cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac
= $600 + $1800
= $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of White Oak trees and the number of Lodgepole Pine trees.

Let's denote the number of White Oak trees planted on the first day as W1 and the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day as P1. We are given that W1 = 20. Since Mr. Julius planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees on the first day, we can express P1 as 2W1, which equals 2 * 20 = 40.

On the second day, the number of White Oak trees planted is W2 = W1 + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is P2 = P1 + (1/4)P1 = 40 + (1/4) * 40 = 40 + 10 = 50.

The total number of trees planted on the first day is W1 + P1 = 20 + 40 = 60. The total number of trees planted on the second day is W2 + P2 = 30 + 50 = 80.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is the sum of the trees planted on each day: 60 + 80 = 140.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the amount of root beer available for the party, we must consider the sequence of events that affected the quantity of root beer.

Initially, Fred had 24 gallons of root beer. On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, resulting in 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remaining.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, reducing the amount to 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, resulting in 8 - 3 = 5 gallons.

To find the amount available for each person, we divide the remaining 5 gallons by the number of people (3) and obtain 5/3 gallons per person.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{5}{3}}$"
"To solve this linear equation, we can employ basic algebraic techniques. The equation is 4x + 8 = 40. 

First, we'll subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with the variable: 4x = 40 - 8, which simplifies to 4x = 32.

Next, we'll divide both sides by 4 to solve for x: x = 32 / 4, which simplifies to x = 8.

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

Final Answer: The final answer is 8."
"To determine the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we can break down the problem into two steps.

First, we need to find one-third of the total number of fish, which is 66. This can be calculated as:

(1/3) × 66 = 22

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish. To do this, we first need to find the number of remaining fish, which is:

66 - 22 = 44

Now, we can calculate 5/11 of 44:

(5/11) × 44 = 20

Therefore, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:

22 + 20 = 42

The final answer is 42."
"To determine the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we must consider the initial number of colors from both the palettes and the makeup sets.

Amy initially had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, resulting in a total of 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes. Additionally, she had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, contributing a total of 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets. Therefore, the total number of colors Amy initially had is 8 + 18 = 26.

However, her sister stole one palette containing 4 colors, reducing the total number of colors to 26 - 4 = 22.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 colors. The remaining colors from this set are 6 - 3 = 3.

To find the total number of colors Amy has left, we add the remaining colors from the palettes (2) and the remaining colors from the makeup sets (3), resulting in a total of 2 + 3 = 5 colors.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to find the height of the first floor. Since the house is 7 times as high as Mattison, and Mattison is 60 inches tall, we can express this as:

Height of first floor = 7 * Height of Mattison
= 7 * 60
= 420 inches

Next, we need to find the height of the second floor. Since the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, we can express this as:

Height of second floor = 3 * Height of Mattison
= 3 * 60
= 180 inches

Now, we can find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor by subtracting the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor:

Height of roof from second floor = Height of first floor - Height of second floor
= 420 - 180
= 240 inches

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"To determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we must first calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders.

Team Alphas found 40% of the total shells, which can be calculated as:

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells

The remaining shells after team Alphas found 280 shells are:

700 - 280 = 420 shells

Team The finders then found 60% of the remaining shells, which can be calculated as:

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells

To find the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we subtract the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells:

420 - 252 = 168 shells

Therefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To determine the walking distance required for the last dog, we can utilize the concept of averages and the given information about the other three dogs. 

First, we calculate the total walking distance required for the first three dogs: 
1 mile (first dog) + 4 miles (second dog) + 3 miles (third dog) = 8 miles.

Since there are four dogs in total, and the average walking distance per dog is 3 miles, we can set up the following equation:

Total walking distance / Number of dogs = Average walking distance
8 miles / 4 dogs = 3 miles

Now, we can solve for the total walking distance required for all four dogs:
Total walking distance = Average walking distance * Number of dogs
Total walking distance = 3 miles * 4 dogs
Total walking distance = 12 miles

To find the walking distance required for the last dog, we subtract the total walking distance of the first three dogs from the total walking distance:
12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debts, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find 40% of the house's value, which is the loan amount. This can be calculated as:

Loan Amount = 0.4 x $250,000 = $100,000

Next, we need to find 60% of the loan amount, which is the amount used to pay off debts. This can be calculated as:

Amount Used for Debts = 0.6 x $100,000 = $60,000

Finally, we subtract the amount used for debts from the loan amount to find the amount leftover:

Amount Leftover = Loan Amount - Amount Used for Debts
= $100,000 - $60,000
= $40,000

Therefore, John had $40,000 leftover after paying his debts."
"To calculate the total earnings from selling the tunas, we need to multiply the total weight of the tunas by the cost per kilogram. 

The total weight of the tunas is 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms. 

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the cost per kilogram:

Total Earnings = Total Weight * Cost per Kilogram
Total Earnings = 128 kg * $0.50/kg
Total Earnings = $64

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To calculate Trinity's profit, we can use the formula:

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price

Given that the selling price is 11/8 of the cost price, we can express this as:

Selling Price = (11/8) * Cost Price

We are given that the cost price is $72. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

Selling Price = (11/8) * 72
= (11 * 9)
= 99

Now, we can calculate the profit:

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
= 99 - 72
= 27

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we can calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day, and Brian ran it for 3 days, resulting in a total of 1 * 3 = 3 liters. The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Running it for 3 days yields a total of 2 * 3 = 6 liters. Lastly, the high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Running it for 5 days results in a total of 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

The total amount of water removed is the sum of these amounts: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the number of balloons thrown, we can utilize the concept of subtraction. Given that there are 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack, the total number of balloons is calculated as follows:

Total number of balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons

Since 12 balloons are left, we can find the number of balloons thrown by subtracting the remaining balloons from the total:

Number of balloons thrown = Total number of balloons - Number of balloons left
= 300 - 12
= 288

Therefore, the number of balloons thrown is 288."
"To determine the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we must first calculate the amount of each medicine in one dose. 

Let's denote the amount of the first medicine as x. According to the problem, the amount of the second medicine is 3 times that amount, so it can be represented as 3x.

We are given that the amount of the first medicine is 14 mL, so x = 14. Therefore, the amount of the second medicine is 3x = 3(14) = 42 mL.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of medicine in one dose by adding the amounts of both medicines: x + 3x = 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8: 56 mL x 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: $\boxed{448}$"
"To determine the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the capacity of John's school first. Since each class in John's school has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying the capacity of Ali's class by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = (1/8) * 120
= 120/8
= 15

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is 2 * 15
= 30

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of their capacities: 120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school)
= 120 + 30
= 150

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To calculate the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to determine the interest on the initial loan amount of $300. The interest rate is 2% per annum, but since the interest is compounded monthly, we'll use the monthly interest rate of 0.5% (2%/12).

Monthly interest rate = 0.5% = 0.005

The total amount owed after 11 months, including the monthly payments, can be calculated as follows:

Total amount owed after 11 months = Initial loan amount + (Monthly payment * 11)
= $300 + ($25 * 11)
= $300 + $275
= $575

Now, we calculate the interest accrued on the total amount owed after 11 months:

Interest = Total amount owed after 11 months * Monthly interest rate
= $575 * 0.005
= $2.875

The amount to be paid in the twelfth month is the sum of the monthly payment and the interest:

Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = Monthly payment + Interest
= $25 + $2.875
= $27.875

The final answer is: $27.88"
"To determine the number of diapers Jordan changes per day, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Given that there are 2 children, each requiring 5 diaper changes, the total number of diaper changes is calculated as follows:

2 children * 5 diaper changes per child = 10 diaper changes

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, we can express this as a fraction:

10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of red jelly beans in the jar, we must first calculate the total volume of the jar. Given that the jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches, we can calculate the volume using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

V = lwh

where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

V = 6 * 6 * 15
V = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans have an efficiency of 80%, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to account for the packing efficiency:

Total jelly beans = V / 0.8
Total jelly beans = 540 / 0.8
Total jelly beans = 675

Next, we need to calculate the number of red jelly beans, which is 30% of the total number of jelly beans:

Number of red jelly beans = Total jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 675 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 202.5

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number:

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Estimated number of red jelly beans
Difference = 900 - 202.5
Difference = 697.5

The final answer is: $\boxed{697.5}$"
"To calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, bringing the total to 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second station. The total number of people on the bus is now 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, resulting in a total of 90 * 2 = 180 people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the remaining spaces on the bus are 200 - 180 = 20.

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we can break down the problem into two parts: the initial 5 years and the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit was $2, and she visited the museum 3 times a year. The total cost for the first 5 years is 5 * 3 * $2 = $30.

After a 150% increase, the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. For the next 3 years, she visited the museum 3 times a year, so the total cost for the next 3 years is 3 * $5 = $15.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits is $30 + $15 = $45.

The final answer is $45."
"To determine the total time required for everyone to try the escape room, we can employ a simple division-based approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of students: 10 students/grade * 3 grades = 30 students. Since 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

To accommodate the fractional group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students. The time required for each group is 45 minutes. 

The total time required for 3 full groups is 3 * 45 minutes = 135 minutes. For the 4th group with 2 students, the time required is 45 minutes.

Total time required = 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Therefore, the total time required for everyone to try the escape room is 180 minutes."
"To determine the total amount Ali has to pay John, we can calculate the cost of the items separately and then add them together.

The cost of 4 tables at $20 each can be calculated using the formula for multiplication: 4 × $20 = $80.

Similarly, the cost of 2 roof frames at $10 each can be calculated using the same formula: 2 × $10 = $20.

Now, we add the costs of the tables and the roof frames to find the total amount: $80 + $20 = $100.

Therefore, Ali has to pay John a total of $100."
"To determine the length of the longer piece of the board, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We can set up the equation based on the total length of the board:

x + 4x = 40

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 40

Dividing both sides by 5, we find:

x = 8

Now that we have the value of x, we can calculate the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x
= 4(8)
= 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."

"To determine the total amount of fabric Luke needs to buy, we must calculate the total width of the windows and then multiply it by 2.

The total width of the windows can be found by multiplying the number of windows (5) by the width of each window (35 inches).

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we can break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is:
16 × $0.25 = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, so the total cost is:
20 × $0.20 = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

Therefore, the total cost of the 36-minute call is $8.00."
"To determine the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we must first calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. 

Then, we add 1 more inch to this amount, so the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

Therefore, the total inches of rain on Tuesday is 5 inches."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as x. Since Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies can be represented as 3x - 2.

We know that the total number of treats is 10, and each person receives 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats can be expressed as 2 times the number of people, which is 5. This gives us the equation:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

To solve for x, we can combine like terms and isolate the variable:

4x - 2 = 10

Adding 2 to both sides of the equation yields:

4x = 12

Dividing both sides by 4:

x = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount, we can use the following steps:

First, find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount: $35 (manicure) + $40 (pedicure) = $75.

Next, calculate the discount amount: 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost: $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art sessions (5 for each hand). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, add the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount to the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $90 for the manicure, pedicure, and nail art.

"To determine the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we can break down the problem into individual components and calculate the total number of issues from each magazine.

First, we have 3 magazines that send 12 issues each, resulting in a total of 3 x 12 = 36 issues per year.

Next, we have 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 x 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, we can add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives a total of 66 magazines per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{66}$"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. 

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley's total number of paintings can be expressed as x + 8.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha's total number of paintings can be represented as (x + 8) - 12.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."

"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we can break down the problem into two parts: the standard rate lessons and the veteran lessons.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard rate lessons. Charlie has 4 one-hour lessons at the standard rate of $80 per hour. We can calculate this as:

4 * $80 = $320

Next, we need to calculate the earnings from the veteran lessons. Charlie has 2 one-hour lessons with a veteran, and his rate is reduced by 25% of the standard rate. The reduced rate is:

$80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - 0.25 * $80 = $80 - $20 = $60

Now, we can calculate the earnings from the veteran lessons:

2 * $60 = $120

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to get the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

$320 + $120 = $440

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To calculate the mean score, we need to find the sum of all the scores and divide by the total number of scores. The formula for the mean is:

Mean = (Sum of all scores) / (Total number of scores)

Given the scores: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60

First, let's add up the scores:
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

Now, let's divide the sum by the total number of scores (9):
Mean = 630 / 9
Mean = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To determine the number of pomelos Eve gave away, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of pomelos Eve gave away as x. Since she had 1/4 of the original amount left, we can express this as:

20 - x = (1/4) * 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 - x = 5

To isolate x, we can subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

-x = -15

Multiplying both sides by -1 to solve for x, we get:

x = 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the amount of money Walter received from selling the remaining apples, we must first calculate the number of apples remaining after he ate 2/5 of the initial 60 apples.

The fraction 2/5 represents the proportion of apples eaten, so we can calculate the number of apples eaten as follows:

(2/5) × 60 = (2 × 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples

The remaining number of apples is then:

60 - 24 = 36 apples

Next, we calculate 25% of the remaining apples, which Walter gave to his sister:

(25/100) × 36 = 0.25 × 36 = 9 apples

The number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:

36 - 9 = 27 apples

Since Walter sold the remaining apples at $3 each, we can calculate the total amount of money he received as:

27 apples × $3/apple = $81

Therefore, Walter received $81 from selling the remaining apples to his uncle.

The final answer is: $81"
"To determine the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a proportion based on the given information. Since 9 novels represent 3 quarters of the total novels written this year, we can express this relationship as:

9 = (3/4) × Total Novels

To solve for the total number of novels, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3:

Total Novels = 9 × (4/3)

Total Novels = 9 × 4 / 3

Total Novels = 36 / 3

Total Novels = 12

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

Final answer: 12"
"To calculate the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we can use the formula:

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100

Given that the total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km and Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr, we can calculate the distance covered as follows:

Time = Total distance / Average speed
Time = 6000 km / 50 km/hr
Time = 120 hours

Since Michael traveled for 3 days, the total hours he traveled is 3 * 24 = 72 hours. However, this is not the correct approach. We should use the actual time taken to cover the distance at the given speed.

To find the correct time taken, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 6000 km / 50 km/hr
Time = 120 hours

However, this is the time taken to cover the entire distance at the given speed. Since Michael traveled for 3 days, we can calculate the correct time taken as follows:

Time = 3 days * 24 hours/day
Time = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance covered using the correct time:

Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance covered = 3600 km

Finally, we can calculate the percentage of the distance covered:

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 / 6000) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the initial number of grapes, we can work backwards by considering the information provided.

First, we know that the mother used 48 grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. This means the total grapes used by the mother can be represented as 4 * 12 = 48.

We also know that Madeline and her brother used a total of 36 grapes. To find the initial number of grapes, we need to add the grapes used by the mother to the grapes used by Madeline and her brother.

Let's denote the initial number of grapes as x. Since Madeline ate 6 grapes, her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, which is 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. The total grapes used by the family is 6 (by Madeline) + 30 (by her brother) + 48 (by the mother) = 84 grapes.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x - 6 - 30 - 48 = 84

Combine like terms:

x - 84 = 84

Add 84 to both sides:

x = 168

Therefore, there were 168 grapes at the beginning.

Final answer: 168"
"To determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School, we can utilize the principle of addition. The number of teachers who were absent due to illness (13) and the number of substitute teachers (9) can be combined to find the total number of teachers present.

Let's calculate the total number of teachers:

Total number of teachers = Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers
= 13 + 9
= 22

Therefore, the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School that day was 22.

Final Answer: The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we can break down the costs into their respective components. The cost of pasta is a constant $1.00 per box, while the cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00 per week, and the cost of gruyere cheese is twice that amount, which is $6.00 per week.

The total weekly cost can be represented as:

$1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00 per week

To find the total cost per year, we can multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year (52):

$10.00 per week * 52 weeks per year = $520.00 per year

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 per year on making macaroni and cheese.

The final answer is: $520"
"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we can calculate the ratio of cleaning time to the total time worked and then convert it to a percentage.

The custodian spends 20 hours cleaning and works a total of 40 hours over 5 days. 

First, we find the ratio of cleaning time to total time worked: 
20 hours / 40 hours = 0.5

To convert this ratio to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 
0.5 * 100 = 50%

Therefore, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we must first establish the capacity of each shelf. We know that the middle two shelves can hold 10 books each, and the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. Therefore, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the shelves: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books
Total capacity: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, we can divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves to find the number of bookcases needed. 

To avoid fractional bookcases, we must round up to the nearest whole number. 

The number of bookcases needed is equal to the ceiling of 110 / 45.

Let's calculate the ceiling of 110 / 45.

110 / 45 = 2.44

The ceiling of 2.44 is 3.

Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases.

Final answer: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate Rose's profit, we must first determine the total cost and the total selling price.

The total cost can be found by multiplying the number of dozens by the cost per dozen: 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of eggs, which is 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Now, we can calculate the total selling price by multiplying the number of eggs by the selling price per egg: 60 * $1 = $60.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price: $60 - $12 = $48.

Therefore, Rose's profit is $48."
"To determine the number of white hats, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we find the number of hats that are not red. Since half of the hats are red, the remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

Next, we calculate the number of blue hats, which is 3/5 of the remaining hats. This can be expressed as (3/5) * 50 = 30.

Now, to find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20.

Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the cost per stick of beef jerky, we can apply the concept of unit price. The formula for unit price is:

Unit Price = Total Cost / Total Quantity

In this case, the total cost is $15.00 (after the $3.00 discount) and the total quantity is 30 sticks. 

Unit Price = $15.00 / 30
Unit Price = $0.50

To express the unit price in cents, we can multiply by 100:

Unit Price = $0.50 × 100
Unit Price = 50 cents

Therefore, each stick of beef jerky costs 50 cents.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to get correct on the second test, we can calculate the total number of questions she needs to get correct overall. Since she must achieve a 70% passing score, we can set up the following equation:

Total questions = 70 (first test) + 40 (second test) = 110

Let x be the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test. Then, the total number of questions she needs to get correct overall is:

0.7(110) = 77

Since she already got 60% of the first test correct, which is 0.6(70) = 42 questions, we can set up the following equation:

42 + x = 77

Solving for x, we get:

x = 77 - 42
x = 35

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to achieve a 70% passing score and move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is 35."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as x. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can express the number of blueberry cubes as 5x - 4.

We are given that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combining like terms, we get:

6x - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides yields:

6x = 120

Dividing both sides by 6 results in:

x = 20

Now that we have found the value of x, we can calculate the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

The final answer is: $\boxed{96}$"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored, we can utilize the formula for calculating total points:

Total Points = Number of Games Played * Points per Game

Given:
Number of Games Played per Year = 40
Number of Years = 4
Points per Game = 21

Total Points = 40 * 4 * 21

First, multiply the number of games played per year by the number of years:
40 * 4 = 160

Then, multiply the result by the points per game:
160 * 21 = 3360

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To determine the number of marbles Brendan ended up with, we can break down the events as follows:

Initially, Brendan had 10 marbles. He lost half of them, which is equivalent to 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. Therefore, he was left with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles.

However, he then found 3 more marbles, increasing the total to 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.

Finally, he picked up a bead instead of a marble, so we need to subtract 1 from the total. This results in 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Therefore, Brendan ended up with 7 marbles.

Final answer: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given average conversion rates.

Let's break down the problem into two conversion rates:

1. The conversion rate from potential customers to customers: 1 potential customer yields 1/2 customer.
2. The conversion rate from customers to car sales: 1 customer yields 1 car.

We can combine these rates to find the conversion rate from potential customers to car sales: (1/2) * (1/1) = 1/2.

Now, we can use this combined conversion rate to calculate the number of potential customers Jason needs to generate to sell 15 cars:

Number of potential customers = Number of cars / Combined conversion rate
= 15 / (1/2)
= 15 * 2
= 30

Finally, we can calculate the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to generate 30 potential customers:

Number of telephone calls = Number of potential customers / Potential customer conversion rate
= 30 / (1/25)
= 30 * 25
= 750

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

750"
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights, we can break down the problem into two components: the number of candles and the number of flashlights.

First, let's calculate the total number of candles. We have two types of candles: small and medium. Half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

The number of rooms with small candles is 8 / 2 = 4. 
The total number of small candles is 4 * 4 = 16.

The number of rooms with medium candles is also 4. 
The total number of medium candles is 4 * 5 = 20.

The total number of candles is the sum of small and medium candles: 16 + 20 = 36.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights. Since there is one flashlight for each person, and there are 4 people in the house, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Therefore, the total number of candles and flashlights is 36 + 4 = 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of chips each person will receive, we can employ a straightforward division operation. Given that Mitchell has 110 chips in total and there are 5 family members, we can calculate the number of chips per person as follows:

Number of chips per person = Total number of chips ÷ Number of family members
= 110 chips ÷ 5
= 22 chips

Therefore, each family member will receive 22 chips.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To calculate the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we can break down the process into individual segments and apply the given time constraints.

Let's denote the time taken to solve the first side as t1, the second and third sides as t2, and the last two sides as t3. We are given the following information:

t1 = 5 minutes
t2 = 2t1
t3 = 2t1/2

Since the last two sides take half as long as the first, we can simplify t3 as t3 = t1/2.

Now, we can express the total time (T) as the sum of the individual times:

T = t1 + t2 + t2 + t3 + t3
T = t1 + 2t2 + 2t3
T = t1 + 2t1 + 2(t1/2)
T = t1 + 2t1 + t1
T = 4t1

Substituting the given value of t1, we get:

T = 4(5)
T = 20 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 20 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of items in the changing room, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the number of helmets, robots, and footballs.

Let's denote the number of helmets as H, the number of robots as R, and the number of footballs as F. We are given that H = 20 and H = R/2. We can use this information to find the number of robots and footballs.

First, we can express the number of robots in terms of helmets: R = 2H. Substituting H = 20, we get R = 2(20) = 40.

Next, we can express the number of footballs in terms of helmets: F = 2H. Substituting H = 20, we get F = 2(20) = 40.

Now, we can calculate the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs: Total = R + H + F = 40 + 20 + 40 = 100.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we can utilize the concept of unitary method. 

First, we need to calculate the total minutes Tim spends on calls in a week. Since he spends 6 hours a day on calls, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

6 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day

Since there are 5 days in a work week, the total minutes he spends on calls in a week is:

360 minutes/day × 5 days = 1800 minutes

Now, we can calculate the total number of calls by dividing the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a single call (15 minutes):

1800 minutes ÷ 15 minutes/call = 120 calls

Therefore, Tim deals with 120 calls in a week."
"To determine the additional time required for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings, we can calculate the difference in drying times between the two varnishes.

Let's denote the time it takes for the old varnish to dry on one painting as 7 minutes and the time for the new varnish as 12 minutes. We are interested in finding the difference in drying time for 6 paintings.

The time it takes for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings is 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

The time it takes for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings is 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we can break down the problem into three distinct groups based on the watering requirements.

First, we'll calculate the amount of water needed for the 4 plants that require half a cup of water. This can be expressed as 4 × 0.5 cups.

Next, we'll calculate the amount of water needed for the 8 plants that require 1 cup of water. This can be expressed as 8 × 1 cup.

Lastly, we'll calculate the amount of water needed for the remaining 8 plants, which require a quarter of a cup of water. This can be expressed as 8 × 0.25 cups.

Now, we'll add the water needed for each group: 4 × 0.5 + 8 × 1 + 8 × 0.25.

Let's calculate the total amount of water needed: 4 × 0.5 = 2 cups, 8 × 1 = 8 cups, and 8 × 0.25 = 2 cups. Adding these amounts together, we get 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we can break down the problem into two parts: the time spent hopping on land and the time spent swimming in water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance can be represented as 200 yards. We can calculate the time spent on land and water separately.

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute
Time on land = 5 minutes

Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute
Time in water = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on land + Time in water
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 15 minutes

Therefore, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is 15 minutes."
"To determine the total cost of the popsicle sticks needed for Bob's project, we can employ a straightforward division operation to calculate the number of boxes required.

Let's denote the number of popsicle sticks needed as N and the number of sticks per box as S. We are given that N = 56 and S = 8. To find the number of boxes needed, we can use the formula:

Number of boxes = N / S

Substituting the given values, we get:

Number of boxes = 56 / 8
= 7

Since each box costs $2.00, the total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of boxes by the cost per box:

Total cost = Number of boxes × Cost per box
= 7 × $2.00
= $14.00

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we can break down the costs as follows:

Let's denote the cost of the main phone as M and the cost of each additional phone as A. We are given that M = 2A and M = $20. From this, we can solve for A:

M = 2A
$20 = 2A
A = $20 / 2
A = $10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone, we can calculate the total cost of the additional phones:

Number of additional phones = 4
Cost of each additional phone = $10
Total cost of additional phones = 4 x $10
Total cost of additional phones = $40

Finally, we add the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones to find the total cost of the whole phone plan:

Total cost = M + Total cost of additional phones
Total cost = $20 + $40
Total cost = $60

Therefore, the total cost of the whole phone plan is $60."

"To calculate the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we must first determine his new speaking speed in words per minute. 

Given that his original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM) and his speed increases by a factor of 2.5 after training, we can calculate his new speed as follows:

New speed = Original speed × 2.5
New speed = 150 WPM × 2.5
New speed = 375 WPM

Next, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages, with each page containing 450 words. 

Total words = Number of pages × Words per page
Total words = 10 pages × 450 words/page
Total words = 4500 words

Now, we can calculate the time it would take to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM:

Time = Total words ÷ New speed
Time = 4500 words ÷ 375 WPM
Time = 12 minutes

"To calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we can break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, we need to find the number of people on the first three days. On the first day, Conor found 50 people at the beach. The next day, 20 more people were present, resulting in 70 people. On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, which is 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people for the first three days:
50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people

For the remaining four days, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. To find the total number of people for these days, we can multiply the average by the number of days:
60 * 4 = 240 people

"To determine the total number of kernels that popped, we can break down the problem into four distinct intervals and calculate the number of kernels popped during each interval.

Let's denote the initial rate of popping as r. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop, which can be expressed as 20 = r * 0.5. Solving for r, we get r = 40 kernels per second.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to 4 times the initial rate, resulting in 4r = 4 * 40 = 160 kernels.

In the subsequent 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to 4 times the previous rate, resulting in 4 * 160 = 640 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate decreases to half the previous rate, resulting in 320 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped:
20 + 160 + 640 + 320 = 1120 kernels

However, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. A quarter of 320 is 320 / 4 = 80 kernels.

The total number of kernels that popped is 1120 + 80 = 1200 kernels.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1200}$"
"To determine the total number of lemons required, we must first calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed. Since Tim wants to make 5 gallons of lemonade, and each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, we can calculate the total number of cups of lemon juice needed as follows:

5 gallons × 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed by dividing the total number of cups of lemon juice by 6:

5 cups ÷ 1 cup/6 lemons = 5 × 6/6 = 5

Therefore, Tim will need 5 lemons.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total amount of dog food required, we must consider the daily consumption of both breeds. 

First, we calculate the total daily consumption by adding the individual daily consumption of German Shepherds and Bulldogs. 

The daily consumption of German Shepherds is 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg/day. 
The daily consumption of Bulldogs is 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg/day. 
The total daily consumption is 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg/day.

To find the total weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7. 
Total weekly consumption = 21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To calculate the total number of pairs of animal legs, we can utilize the concept of combinatorics and basic arithmetic operations.

First, we need to find the total number of legs. Since there are 10 two-legged animals and 15 four-legged animals, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

Total legs = (2 * number of 2-legged animals) + (4 * number of 4-legged animals)
Total legs = (2 * 10) + (4 * 15)
Total legs = 20 + 60
Total legs = 80

Now, to find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:

Total pairs of legs = Total legs / 2
Total pairs of legs = 80 / 2
Total pairs of legs = 40

Therefore, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40."
"To determine the number of red blocks in the tower, we can utilize the principle of addition to find the total number of blocks and then subtract the known quantities of blue and yellow blocks.

Let's denote the number of red blocks as 'r'. We are given that the tower consists of 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, which translates to 2 * 4 = 8 yellow blocks. The total number of blocks in the tower is 32.

We can set up the equation: 4 (blue blocks) + 8 (yellow blocks) + r (red blocks) = 32 (total blocks)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12 + r = 32

Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation, we get: r = 20

Therefore, the number of red blocks in the tower is 20."
"To determine the net distance from Elvis's house, we can utilize the concept of relative motion. Since Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18mph, the distance covered in this direction is:

Distance = Speed × Time = 18mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Conversely, he traveled east for 8 hours at the same speed, covering a distance of:

Distance = Speed × Time = 18mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

To find the net distance from his house, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:

Net Distance = Distance Traveled East - Distance Traveled West
= 144 miles - 90 miles
= 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

Final answer: 54"
"To calculate the value of the boat after three years, we can apply the concept of depreciation using the formula:

Value after n years = Initial value * (1 - Depreciation rate)^n

In this case, the initial value is $9000, and the depreciation rates are 30% for the first two years and 20% for the third year.

Year 1:
Value after 1 year = $9000 * (1 - 0.3) = $9000 * 0.7 = $6300

Year 2:
Value after 2 years = $6300 * (1 - 0.3) = $6300 * 0.7 = $4410

Year 3:
Value after 3 years = $4410 * (1 - 0.2) = $4410 * 0.8 = $3528

Therefore, the boat is worth $3528 after three years.

The final answer is: $3528"
"To determine the number of pink candies in the bag, we must first establish the quantities of the other colors. We are given that the bag contains 54 red candies, twice that amount of orange candies, and half as many yellow candies as red candies.

Let's calculate the number of orange candies:
Orange candies = 2 * 54
Orange candies = 108

Next, we calculate the number of yellow candies:
Yellow candies = 54 / 2
Yellow candies = 27

Now, we can find the total number of non-pink candies:
Red + Orange + Yellow = 54 + 108 + 27
Red + Orange + Yellow = 189

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of non-pink candies from the total number of candies in the bag:
232 - 189
Number of pink candies = 43

The final answer is 43."
"To calculate the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to determine the cost of the bus trips and add it to the cost of the hotel.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 10% of $80. This can be calculated as:

$80 × 0.10 = $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is:

$8 × 7 = $56

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is the sum of these two amounts:

$80 + $56 = $136

Therefore, the total cost of Helen's trip is $136."
"To determine the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we can utilize the concept of subtraction. We know that Dallas initially received an unknown number of marbles from Mazie, denoted as x. After receiving x marbles, Dallas dropped 4, resulting in a total of 21 marbles. This can be represented as:

x - 4 = 21

To solve for x, we can add 4 to both sides of the equation:

x = 21 + 4
x = 25

Now that we know Dallas initially received 25 marbles, we can find the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla by subtracting 25 from the total number of marbles Mazie had:

52 - 25 = 27

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the family's outing, we can break down the expenses into two categories: ticket prices and popcorn costs.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and the cost of a child ticket is $8. Since there are two adults and one child, the total cost of the tickets can be calculated as follows:

2 adult tickets = 2 x $12 = $24
1 child ticket = $8
Total cost of tickets = $24 + $8 = $32

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the popcorns. The cost of two popcorns is $3 each, so the total cost of the popcorns is:

2 popcorns = 2 x $3 = $6

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns:

Total cost = $32 + $6 = $38

Therefore, the family pays a total of $38 for their outing."
"To calculate the total weight of the car and its contents, we must consider the combined weight of the vehicle, luggage, and the two children. This can be represented as:

Total weight = Weight of the car + Weight of luggage + Weight of the children
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds
Force = 0.01 * 1600 pounds
Force = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we can utilize the formula for calculating the mean of two numbers: 

Average = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Given that Mia is 40 years old and is 16 years younger than Emma, we can determine Emma's age as follows:

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can calculate the average of their ages:

Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of their ages is 48."
"To determine the total number of good seashells, we must first calculate the total number of seashells found by the three individuals and then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

Let's denote the number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny as T, N, and B, respectively. We are given:

T = 214
N = 432
B = 86

The total number of seashells is the sum of the seashells found by each individual:

Total seashells = T + N + B
Total seashells = 214 + 432 + 86
Total seashells = 732

We are also given that 67 seashells were cracked. To find the number of good seashells, we subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total:

Number of good seashells = Total seashells - Number of cracked seashells
Number of good seashells = 732 - 67
Number of good seashells = 665

Therefore, the total number of good seashells is 665."
"To calculate the total cost of the place settings, we can apply the principle of multiplication to determine the cost of each type of plate and then sum the results.

The cost of 12 dinner plates at $6.00 each can be calculated as 12 × $6.00 = $72.00.

The cost of 12 salad plates at $4.00 each can be calculated as 12 × $4.00 = $48.00.

The cost of 12 bowls at $5.00 each can be calculated as 12 × $5.00 = $60.00.

"To determine the amount of feed left after a week, we must first calculate the total daily feed consumption. With 5 pigs, each consuming 4 pounds of feed twice a day, the total daily consumption is:

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7:

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Now, we subtract the total feed consumed from the total ordered to find the remaining feed:

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

Therefore, there are 20 pounds of feed left after a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of hot dogs required for the party, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

Let's denote the number of guests as 'g' and the number of hot dogs per guest as 'h'. We are given that g = 20 and h = 2. The total number of hot dogs required can be calculated as:

Total hot dogs = g * h
Total hot dogs = 20 * 2
Total hot dogs = 40

Since John already has 4 hot dogs, we need to add those to the total:
Total hot dogs = 40 + 4
Total hot dogs = 44

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs. To determine the number of packs required, we can divide the total number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack:

Number of packs = Total hot dogs / 6
Number of packs = 44 / 6
Number of packs = 7.33

Since we cannot buy a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, John needs 8 packs of hot dogs.

The cost of each pack is $2. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
Total cost = Number of packs * $2
Total cost = 8 * $2
Total cost = $16

Therefore, John needs to spend $16 on hot dogs."
"To calculate Frances' remaining funds, we must first determine her total revenue and subtract her total expenses.

Frances' revenue from cupcakes is calculated as 20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake, which equals $40. Additionally, she earns $40 from selling 40 cookies at $1 each. Therefore, her total revenue is $40 + $40 = $80.

Next, we calculate her total expenses. Frances purchases five trays at $4 each, resulting in a total cost of 5 * $4 = $20.

To find Frances' remaining funds, we subtract her total expenses from her total revenue: $80 - $20 = $60.

Therefore, Frances has $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the total number of children following the ice cream truck, we can utilize a simple arithmetic progression (AP) formula. 

Let's denote the initial number of children as 'a', the common difference as 'd', and the number of terms as 'n'. We know that the initial number of children (a) is 5. 

On the second street, each child is joined by another child, so the number of children becomes a + d. Since each of the 5 children is joined by another child, the common difference 'd' is 1. 

On the third street, each of the existing children is joined by 2 more children, so the number of children becomes a + 2d. Since each of the 10 children (from the previous step) is joined by 2 more children, the common difference 'd' is 2.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 
a + (n-1)d = a + 2d + 2d
Since a = 5 and d = 1 for the first two steps, we can simplify the equation to:
5 + (n-1) = 5 + 3d
5 + (n-1) = 5 + 3(1)
5 + (n-1) = 5 + 3
(n-1) = 8
n = 9

Now, we can calculate the total number of children:
Total number of children = a + (n-1)d
= 5 + (9-1)1
= 5 + 8
= 13

Therefore, there are 13 children following the truck.

13"

"To determine the total age of the siblings, we can break down the problem into manageable steps. 

First, we know that the age of the older brother is twice the age of the younger brother. Let's denote the age of the younger brother as 'x'. Since the younger brother is 12 years old, we can set up the equation:

x = 12

Now, we can find the age of the older brother by multiplying 'x' by 2:

Age of older brother = 2x
= 2 * 12
= 24

Next, we know that all three sisters are the same age, which is 16 years old. To find the total age of the siblings, we can add up the ages of all the siblings:

Total age = Age of younger brother + Age of older brother + (Age of one sister * 3)
= 12 + 24 + (16 * 3)
= 12 + 24 + 48
= 84

Therefore, the total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we can break down the problem into two components: time spent on meditation and time spent on yoga.

First, let's calculate the total time spent on meditation. Charisma meditates for 15 minutes, twice a day, for 4 weeks, and 7 days a week. This can be represented as:

2 * 15 * 4 * 7 = 420 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent on yoga from hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:

1 * 5 * 4 * 7 = 140 hours
140 * 60 = 8400 minutes

Now, we can add the total time spent on meditation and yoga to find the overall total:

420 + 8400 = 8820 minutes

Therefore, Charisma has spent a total of 8820 minutes on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks.

"To determine the total number of sunflower seeds, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since 1 dozen is equivalent to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

Next, we calculate 50% of the number of seeds in a small sunflower. This can be found by multiplying 36 by 0.5, resulting in 18.

Now, we add the 50% increase (18) to the original number of seeds in a small sunflower (36), yielding 54 seeds for the large sunflower.

Finally, we sum the seeds from both sunflowers: 36 (small sunflower) + 54 (large sunflower) = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To determine the number of pens Sarah has, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the number of pens owned by Timothy and George, and subsequently, Sarah.

Given that Timothy has three times the number of pens as George, and George has 18 pens, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Let T = number of pens Timothy has
Let G = number of pens George has

T = 3G
T = 3(18)
T = 54

Now, since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can express this relationship as:

Let S = number of pens Sarah has
S = (1/2)T
S = (1/2)(54)
S = 27

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens."
"To determine Jackie's height before the summer, we can work backwards from the given information. 

We know Albert's height is 36 inches, and Anne is twice the size of Albert, making her 2 x 36 = 72 inches tall. Since Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, her height can be calculated as 72 - 2 = 70 inches.

To find Jackie's height before the summer, we subtract the growth of 3 inches: 70 - 3 = 67 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{67}$"
"To calculate the total revenue generated by the company from selling chocolate bars over a two-week period, we can employ the concept of multiplication. 

First, we need to determine the total number of bars produced in two weeks. Since the company produces 5000 bars per day, we can multiply this rate by the number of days in two weeks (14 days).

Total bars produced = 5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70,000 bars

Next, we multiply the total number of bars produced by the selling price per bar, which is $2.

Total revenue = Total bars produced * Price per bar
Total revenue = 70,000 bars * $2/bar
Total revenue = $140,000

Therefore, the company will receive $140,000 for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks.

"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the T-shirts and the cost of the shoes.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8, and Jake buys 2 T-shirts. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, we can calculate the total cost of the T-shirts as follows:

Cost of T-shirts = (1 x $8) + (0.5 x $8)
= $8 + $4
= $12

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake buys them at 40% off. We can calculate the discount as follows:

Discount = 0.4 x $40
= $16

Cost of shoes = Original price - Discount
= $40 - $16
= $24

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store by adding the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes:

Total cost = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes
= $12 + $24
= $36

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36.

"To determine the profit made from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we must first calculate the total cost of producing one jar and then multiply it by 10.

The cost of producing one jar consists of the costs of passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey. Given the respective prices of these ingredients, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Cost of passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
Cost of jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
Cost of honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20
Total cost of one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, to find the profit per jar, we subtract the total cost from the selling price:
Profit per jar: $50 - $44 = $6

To determine the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
Total profit = 10 * $6 = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"To calculate the total dollar amount in the jar, we can utilize the concept of place value and the respective values of each coin type.

"To calculate Josh's earnings over a 2-week period, we can employ a straightforward approach. Since Josh operates 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) and services 3 cars per day, we can first determine the total number of working days in 2 weeks.

Number of working days in 2 weeks = 6 days/week * 2 weeks = 12 days

Next, we can calculate the total number of cars serviced in 2 weeks by multiplying the number of working days by the number of cars serviced per day.

Total cars serviced in 2 weeks = 12 days * 3 cars/day = 36 cars

Finally, we can calculate Josh's total earnings by multiplying the total number of cars serviced by his hourly wage.

Total earnings = 36 cars * $4/car = $144

Therefore, Josh's total earnings over a 2-week period are $144."
"To determine the total number of cookies Randy has now, we can analyze the sequence of events:

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.

1. He eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This results in:
   - 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

2. He then eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, leaving him with:
   - 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
   - 4 sugar cookies (no change)

3. Next, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, resulting in:
   - 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 chocolate chip cookies
   - 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

4. Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner, adding:
   - 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
   - 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

"To determine the total amount Matthew would earn, we can calculate the earnings from each half of his collection separately and then sum them.

Let's denote the total number of toys as N. Since Matthew is willing to sell half of his collection at $5 per toy and the other half at $7 per toy, we can express this as:

Earnings from the first half = (N/2) * 5
Earnings from the second half = (N/2) * 7

Since N = 12, we can substitute this value into the expressions:

Earnings from the first half = (12/2) * 5 = 6 * 5 = $30
Earnings from the second half = (12/2) * 7 = 6 * 7 = $42

Total earnings = Earnings from the first half + Earnings from the second half
Total earnings = $30 + $42
Total earnings = $72

Therefore, Matthew would earn a total of $72 if he agrees to the buyer's offer."
"To determine the number of weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. 

First, we calculate the net change in the number of holes per day, which is the difference between the number of holes filled and the number of holes dug. This net change is 9 - 6 = 3 holes per day.

Next, we divide the total number of holes by the net change in the number of holes per day to find the number of days required to fill the holes. This can be expressed as:

Total holes / Net change in holes per day = 84 / 3 = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days to weeks by dividing by 7:

28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so T = 16 / 2 = 8.
We also know that Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.
The total number of items Igor had is T + B + P, and we know this equals 29. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

8 + B + 16 = 29

Simplifying the equation, we get:

B = 29 - 8 - 16
B = 5

However, this is the number of beakers Igor should have gathered. Since Igor actually gathered the correct number of beakers, we need to find the difference between the correct number of beakers and the number he gathered. Let's denote the number of beakers Igor gathered as x. We know that x = 7 (the correct number of beakers). The number of beakers Igor lost is then:

Number of beakers lost = Correct number of beakers - Number of beakers gathered
= 7 - x

Since we know that Igor gathered 7 beakers, we can substitute x = 7 into the equation:

Number of beakers lost = 7 - 7
= 0

However, this is not possible, as Igor lost some beakers. Let's re-examine the equation:

8 + B + 16 = 29

We can rewrite the equation as:

B = 29 - 8 - 16
B = 5

Since Igor gathered 7 beakers, the correct equation should be:

7 = 8 + B - 16

Simplifying the equation, we get:

7 = B - 8
B = 15

Now, we can find the number of beakers Igor lost:

Number of beakers lost = Correct number of beakers - Number of beakers gathered
= 15 - 7
= 8

The correct answer is 8."
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we can calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and then subtract this from the total number of screws he has.

The number of screws needed for each table is 4 legs * 2 screws per leg = 8 screws per table. Since James is assembling 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 screws per table * 4 tables = 32 screws.

Given that James has 40 screws, we can calculate the number of screws left over as follows:

40 (total screws) - 32 (screws required) = 8 screws

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over."
"To determine the total number of eggs in both baskets, we can utilize the principle of addition. Given that the second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first basket, we can express this relationship as a ratio or a multiplier. In this case, the second basket's egg count is 2 times the first basket's egg count.

Let's denote the number of eggs in the first basket as x. Since the second basket has twice as many eggs, its egg count can be represented as 2x.

The total number of eggs in both baskets can be calculated by adding the egg counts of both baskets:

x (eggs in the first basket) + 2x (eggs in the second basket) = 3x

Since we know the first basket contains 10 eggs, we can substitute x with 10:

10 + 2(10) = 10 + 20 = 30

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To calculate the total amount of money raised, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the amount of money raised by Alexandra as A, Kim as K, Maryam as M, and Sarah as S.

We are given the following information:

A = S + 430
K = A + 320
M = S + 400

We can substitute the expression for A into the equation for K:
K = (S + 430) + 320
K = S + 750

Now, we can substitute the expressions for A and K into the equation for M:
M = S + 400
M = (S + 430) + 320
M = S + 750

Since we know that M = S + 400 and M = S + 750, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:
S + 400 = S + 750

Subtracting S from both sides, we get:
400 = 750

This is a contradiction, indicating that the initial equations are inconsistent. However, we can still calculate the total amount of money raised by adding the given values:
A = S + 430
K = S + 750
M = S + 400
S = 300

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money raised:
Total = A + K + M + S
Total = (300 + 430) + (300 + 750) + 300
Total = 730 + 1050 + 300
Total = 2080

Therefore, the total amount of money raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we can employ the concept of relative speeds and distances. Let's denote Vanessa's speed as V miles per minute and Aaron's speed as A miles per minute. We are given that Aaron's speed is twice that of Vanessa's, so we can express this as:

A = 2V

We are also given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, while Aaron ran 2 miles. Since speed is distance divided by time, we can express their times as:

Time = Distance / Speed

For Aaron, the time taken to run 2 miles is:

t_A = 2 / A
= 2 / (2V)
= 1 / V

For Vanessa, the time taken to run 4 miles is:

t_V = 4 / V

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

1 / V = 16

To solve for V, we can take the reciprocal of both sides:

V = 1 / 16

Now that we have Vanessa's speed, we can find the time it took her to complete her part of the race:

t_V = 4 / (1 / 16)
= 4 * 16
= 64

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

64"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that he requires 3 feet of line for every foot of dock and the existing dock measures 200 feet, the total line required can be calculated as follows:

Total line required = 3 feet/foot of dock * 200 feet of dock
Total line required = 3 * 200
Total line required = 600 feet

However, the caretaker already possesses 6 feet of line. To find the total amount he needs to purchase, we subtract the amount he has from the total required:

Total line to purchase = Total line required - line already available
Total line to purchase = 600 - 6
Total line to purchase = 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to determine the daily revenue. Given that the restaurant receives 6 reservations per night, with each reservation consisting of 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine, we can calculate the daily revenue as follows:

Daily revenue = (Number of reservations per night * Number of meals per reservation * Meal price) + (Number of reservations per night * Bottle price)
= (6 * 2 * $5) + (6 * $5)
= $60 + $30
= $90 per night

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, we can then calculate the weekly revenue by multiplying the daily revenue by 2:

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 2
= $90 * 2
= $180

The final answer is: $180"
"To determine the selling price of each watermelon, we can use the formula for calculating the selling price with a percentage profit:

Selling Price = Cost Price + (Profit Percentage * Cost Price)

Given:
Cost Price = $80
Profit Percentage = 25% = 0.25

Selling Price = $80 + (0.25 * $80)
= $80 + $20
= $100

To find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling Price per Watermelon = Total Selling Price / Number of Watermelons
= $100 / 50
= $2

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. 

First, we need to find the current age of James. Since James is twice as old as Dora, and Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, we can calculate James' current age as follows:

Let's denote Dora's current age as D. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, we can set up the equation: D + 3 = 12. Solving for D, we get D = 12 - 3 = 9.

Now that we know Dora's current age, we can find James' current age, which is 2 times Dora's age: James' current age = 2 * 9 = 18.

Next, we need to find John's current age. We know that James was born when John was 19 years old, and James is currently 18 years old. So, John's current age can be calculated as: John's current age = 19 + 18 = 37.

Now, we need to find John's youngest son's current age. We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, John's youngest son's current age can be calculated as: John's youngest son's current age = 37 - 32 = 5.

Finally, we need to find John's youngest son's age in 3 years. We can calculate this by adding 3 to his current age: John's youngest son's age in 3 years = 5 + 3 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane, we can calculate their individual rates of peeling oranges.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so her rate is 1 orange / 3 minutes. Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so her rate is 1 orange / 4 minutes.

To find the difference in the number of oranges peeled in 60 minutes, we can set up an equation:

Let x be the number of oranges peeled by Ana and y be the number of oranges peeled by Jane.

We know that x + y = 60 (total oranges peeled in 60 minutes)

We also know that x = (1/3) * 60 and y = (1/4) * 60

Simplifying these expressions, we get:

x = 20 and y = 15

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is x - y = 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first determine the discounted price of the radiator. The original price is $400, and Mark receives an 80% discount.

The discount amount is 80% of $400, which can be calculated as 0.8 * $400 = $320. To find the discounted price, we subtract the discount from the original price: $400 - $320 = $80.

Next, we calculate the labor cost by multiplying the number of hours worked (3) by the hourly rate ($50): 3 * $50 = $150.

Finally, we add the discounted price of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total cost: $80 + $150 = $230.

The total cost Mark paid is $230."
"To solve this problem, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as x and the number of cows as y. We are given that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

x + y = 20

We are also given that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write another equation:

2x + 4y = 70

Now, we have a system of linear equations. We can solve for x by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation:

2x + 2y = 40
2x + 4y = 70
-------------------
2y = 30
y = 15

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it into the first equation to solve for x:

x + 15 = 20
x = 5

Therefore, there are 5 chickens.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we calculate the total number of slices: 7 pizzas × 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices.

Next, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 slices ÷ 4 people = 14 slices/person.

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
