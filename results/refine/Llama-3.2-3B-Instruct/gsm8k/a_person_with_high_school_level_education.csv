"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fiber separately.

The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. Since it takes half that much white fiber, we can calculate the amount of white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the amount of blue and white fiber to find the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
= 2 bolts + 1 bolt
= 3 bolts

Therefore, the total number of bolts required for the robe is 3."
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To find the new value, we multiply the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase). 

New value = $80,000 * 2.5
= $200,000

Now, we subtract the original price from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

The final answer is: $120,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs per week, we need to multiply the number of sprints per week by the number of meters per sprint.

James runs 180 meters per week."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we need to calculate the total amount of feed given to her chickens so far and then subtract that from the total daily feed requirement.

The total daily feed requirement for 20 chickens is 3 cups per chicken multiplied by 20 chickens, which equals 60 cups. However, Wendi has already given her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. 

So, the total feed given so far is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find the amount of feed needed for the final meal, we subtract the total feed given so far from the total daily feed requirement: 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.
The cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to follow the given information:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To calculate the total time it takes to download the file, we need to consider the two parts of the download separately.

First, Carla downloads 2 GB/minute for 80% of the file, which is 160 GB. The time taken for this part is:

Time = Total size / Download speed
Time = 160 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 80 minutes

Then, the download is interrupted and restarted. The second download also takes 80 minutes.

Total time taken = Time for first download + Time for second download
Total time taken = 80 minutes + 80 minutes
Total time taken = 160 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down the journey into segments.

First, let's calculate the distance John traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, he doesn't move, so the distance remains 180 miles.

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

Now, he drives for 2 hours at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles

The total distance traveled is the sum of these segments:
Total distance = 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles

Since he initially drove 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
Distance from home = Total distance - Initial distance = 355 - 180 = 175 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings are:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Total earnings for the week:
$400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

First, we calculate the downloads for Month 2, which is three times the downloads of Month 1. This can be expressed as 3 * 60.

Month 2 downloads = 3 * 60
Month 2 downloads = 180

Next, we calculate the downloads for Month 3, which is 30% less than Month 2. This can be expressed as 0.7 * Month 2 downloads.

Month 3 downloads = 0.7 * 180
Month 3 downloads = 126

Now, we add the downloads for all three months to find the total.

Total downloads = Month 1 + Month 2 + Month 3
Total downloads = 60 + 180 + 126
Total downloads = 366

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

The initial cost of the tree is $90. Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. So, the net profit per year is $10.50 (income from lemons) - $3 (expenses) = $7.50.

To find the number of years it takes to cover the initial cost, we can divide the initial cost by the net profit per year: $90 รท $7.50 = 12 years.

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

Final answer: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more at the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we need to find out how many she started with.

Let's assume Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold 1/3 of x at the green house, which is x/3. She sold 2 more at the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red house is x/3 + 2.

The number of vacuum cleaners remaining after selling at the green and red house is x - (x/3 + 2) = 2x/3 - 2.

She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/6 - 1.

The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is x/3 + 2 + x/6 - 1. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation: x - (x/3 + 2 + x/6 - 1) = 5.

To simplify the equation, we need to find a common denominator, which is 6. Multiply the first term by 2/2 to get 2x/6.

Now the equation becomes: 2x/6 - x/6 - 2 + x/6 - 1 = 5.

Combine like terms: 2x/6 - x/6 + x/6 - 2 - 1 = 5.

Simplify: x/6 - 3 = 5.

Add 3 to both sides: x/6 = 8.

Multiply both sides by 6: x = 48.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

The jewelry market is expected to increase by 2.5%, and the electronic gadgets market is expected to rise by 1.2%. We can calculate the potential value of each option by multiplying the initial cost by the respective market increase.

For the jewelry: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250
For the electronic gadgets: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since the potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is higher than the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

The profit is calculated by subtracting the initial cost from the potential value. 

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

The merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances covered on the first day (westward) and the second day (northward). Since they traveled the same distance westward, each train covered 80 miles on the first day. On the second day, they traveled 150 miles northward. Since they traveled the same distance, each train covered 150 miles northward.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of the distances covered on both days:
80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{230}$"
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to find her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Jill earns $20 per hour as a teacher and $30 per hour as a cheerleading coach. She works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from teaching: 
35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from coaching: 
15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week

Now, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching: 
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

And her annual earnings from coaching: 
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Finally, let's add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary: 
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

"To calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to multiply the number of eggs she makes per day by the number of days in 4 weeks.

Since there are 7 days in a week, 4 weeks will have 4 x 7 = 28 days. 

Now, we multiply the number of eggs she makes per day (3) by the total number of days (28):
3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 84 eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:
84 eggs รท 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs

The final answer is 7."
"To find the speed required for the remaining distance, we need to calculate the time Marissa has left to cover the remaining 6 miles. Since she wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can find the total time she needs to spend.

Total distance = 12 miles
Average speed = 4 miles per hour
Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 / 4
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already spent 2 hours, so she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to cover the remaining distance.

Remaining distance = 6 miles
Time left = 1 hour
Speed required = Distance / Time
Speed required = 6 / 1
Speed required = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before and after spilling.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in 10 liters of orange drink is:
10 * (2/3) = 20/3 liters

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is:
15 * (3/5) = 9 liters

The total amount of water in both drinks initially is:
20/3 + 9 = 49/3 liters

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water left in the orange drink is:
20/3 - 1 = 17/3 liters

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
17/3 + 9 = 17/3 + 27/3 = 44/3 liters

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:
44 รท 3 = 14.67

The final answer is: 14.67"
"To find the age of Raymond, we need to subtract 6 from Samantha's age, since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. 

Samantha's age is 31, so Raymond's age is 31 - 6 = 25.

Now, we know Raymond's age and the age of his son. To find out how many years ago the son was born, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age.

25 (Raymond's age) - 23 (son's age) = 2

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: 2"

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. Henry stopped after 20 miles, so the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.

Since Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:
40 - 45 = -5 miles

However, since distance cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's re-calculate the distance between the first and second stops.

The distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 40 miles, and the distance from the first stop to the second stop is 20 + 15 = 35 miles. Since Henry traveled 20 miles before the first stop and 15 miles after the first stop, the distance between the first and second stops is the difference between these two distances.

Distance between the first and second stops = 20 + 15 = 35 miles

"To find the cost of the boots, we need to first find the cost of the two pairs of heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 * $33 = $66.

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost five dollars less than the two pairs of heels, the cost of the boots is $99 - $5 = $94.

The final answer is 94."
"To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we need to first determine their current ages. Since their ages are in the ratio of 7:11, we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x, respectively.

We know that their total age is 162, so we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162.

Combine like terms: 18x = 162.

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9.

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63, and Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.

"To find the number of gold coins, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he got from selling his Lego sets. He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left after buying the video games, so the amount he spent on video games and had left is $195 - $160 = $35.

Since he spent $35 on video games and had $5 left, he must have had $35 + $5 = $40 initially.

Now, we know John had $40 initially and spent $195 on Lego sets. To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we can divide the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets by the price of each set: 195 / 15 = 13.

However, the question asks how many Lego sets he still has. Since he sold all his Lego sets, he doesn't have any left.

"To find John's speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and divide it by the total time.

Since John runs 3 days a week, and he runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

Distance = Speed ร Time
We know the total time is 6 hours (3 hours on the first day and 1.5 hours on each of the other two days).

Let's denote John's speed as 's'. Since he runs 3 hours on the first day, the distance covered on the first day is 3s. On the other two days, he runs 1.5 hours each, so the distance covered on those days is 1.5s + 1.5s = 3s. The total distance is the sum of these distances: 3s + 3s = 6s.

We are given that the total distance is 60 miles. So, we can set up the equation:

6s = 60

To find John's speed, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:

s = 60/6
s = 10

Therefore, John's speed is 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total distance Dana can travel in six hours, we need to calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she spends 6 hours in total, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 = 2 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is 3 miles per hour * 2 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to calculate the remaining calories in your daily target and then divide that by the calories per serving.

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have.

200 รท 250 = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 300g, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving to find the total weight.

0.8 ร 300 = 240g

So, you can eat 240g of chips."
"To calculate Charlie's net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. 

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Charlie uses 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks, which costs $10.00. Since he makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, the cost of the wicks is already included in the $10.00. 

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of hours she spent on each day.

First, let's calculate the hours she spent on Monday. She wrote 5 articles, and each article takes 4 hours. So, the total hours spent on Monday is 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours she spent on Tuesday. She wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. She wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, so on Wednesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she spent on each day: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially, we need to add the notes she had in her purse and the notes she used at work.

Let's denote the number of notes in the package she purchased as x. We know that she initially had 80 notes in her purse and used 220 notes at work. Since she had 23 notes remaining, the total number of notes she had initially is 80 + 220 + 23 = 323.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation: 80 + 220 + x = 323. Solving for x, we get:

80 + 220 + x = 323
300 + x = 323
x = 23

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total amount spent on ties, we need to calculate the cost of the red ties first. Since the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, we can find the cost of a red tie by adding 50% of the cost of a blue tie to the cost of a blue tie.

Cost of a blue tie = $40
Increase in cost = 50% of $40 = 0.5 x $40 = $20
Cost of a red tie = $40 + $20 = $60

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:
Number of blue ties = 5
Number of red ties = 2 x 5 = 10

The total amount spent on red ties is:
10 x $60 = $600

The total amount spent on ties is:
$200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to divide the total length of the wire (in inches) by the length of each piece.

First, convert the length of the wire from feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

"To find the total number of occupied units, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total units in the building.

Total units = 15 floors * 8 units per floor
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can find the number of occupied units by multiplying the total units by 3/4.

Occupied units = 120 * 3/4
Occupied units = 90

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total units.

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Unoccupied units = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To calculate the amount of money Lloyd makes per week, we need to first find out how many eggs he sells per week. Since his chickens produce 252 eggs per day, we can multiply this number by 7 to get the total number of eggs per week.

252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens.

1764 eggs per week รท 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, we can multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find the total amount of money Lloyd makes per week.

147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to calculate the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM and then use that distance to determine the time it takes to return.

Since Tom is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 mph x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove from his book bag. We know that he needs to remove a total of 15 pounds and he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books. 

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Weight of toys to remove = Total weight to remove - Weight of comic books removed
Weight of toys to remove = 15 - 7.5
Weight of toys to remove = 7.5

Now, we can divide the weight of toys to remove by the weight of a single toy to find the number of toys:
Number of toys to remove = Weight of toys to remove / Weight of a single toy
Number of toys to remove = 7.5 / 0.5
Number of toys to remove = 15

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: 15"
"To determine which day the mechanic earned more revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360, and the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480. The total revenue on Friday is $480.

To find out which day the mechanic earned more, we compare the revenues. Since $480 is greater than $520, the mechanic earned more on Friday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is $520 - $480 = $40. Since the result is negative, it means the mechanic earned less on Friday than on Thursday.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens by multiplying Trixie's kittens by 3.

Patchy's kittens = 3 * 12
Patchy's kittens = 36

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 

Total kittens = Patchy's kittens + Trixie's kittens
Total kittens = 36 + 12
Total kittens = 48

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find the number of bags Jean can fill, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2.

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the remaining lollipops are:
30 - 2 = 28

$42 รท $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15

To avoid any potential division errors, we can convert the weight of the boxes to a more manageable number by finding the largest multiple of 15 that is less than or equal to 1245. 

Since 1245 รท 15 = 83, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83.

The final answer is: 83"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 x $40.00 = $10.00. 

The total extra fees are $10.00 (25% fee) + $3.00 (delivery fees) = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the number of individual raspberries.

The raspberry bush has 6 clusters of 20 fruit each. To find the total number of raspberries in the clusters, we multiply the number of clusters by the number of raspberries in each cluster: 6 * 20 = 120.

Final Answer: The final answer is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the number of bad, sour, and unripe oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Now, subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges."
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the construction, and the insurance.

First, we add the cost of the material and the construction: $500 + $800 = $1300.

Next, we calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of $1300. To find 10% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.10. So, 0.10 x $1300 = $130.

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the total cost so far: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

Janet paid a total of $1430."
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break it down into two parts: the fixed pension for the first 20 years and the 5% of the pension value for the remaining 10 years.

First, let's calculate the total amount she receives in the first 20 years:
$50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000

After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension is $1,000,000. So, her annual pension after 20 years is:
$1,000,000 * 5% = $50,000

Since she quits after 30 years, she receives the fixed annual pension for 10 years and the 5% annual pension for 10 years.

The total amount she receives in the remaining 10 years is:
$50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000
$50,000/year * 5% = $2,500/year * 10 years = $25,000
Total amount = $500,000 + $25,000 = $525,000

Now, we add the total amount she received in the first 20 years and the total amount she received in the remaining 10 years:
$1,000,000 + $525,000 = $1,525,000

To find the average annual pension, we divide the total amount by the total number of years:
$1,525,000 / 30 years = $50,833.33

The final answer is: $50,833.33"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in a half year, we can multiply the monthly cost by 6 to find the total cost for the first half of the year:

140 ร 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. To find 10% of $140, we can multiply 140 by 0.1:

140 ร 0.1 = $14

Now, we subtract the 10% from the original amount to find the reduced amount:

140 - 14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, we multiply the reduced amount by 6 to find the total cost for the second half of the year:

126 ร 6 = $756

Finally, we add the total cost for the first half of the year and the total cost for the second half of the year to find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service:

$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to find out how many miles she can get per gallon. We know that her tank holds 12 gallons and she used 4 gallons to fill it up. 

First, let's find out how many gallons she has left: 12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons remaining.

Now, we can divide the miles she has already traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she has left (8 gallons) to find the miles per gallon: 100 miles รท 8 gallons = 12.5 miles per gallon.

So, Sophia can drive approximately 12.5 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours spent each week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time, and he reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total hours spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of teams and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players is 2 teams per school * 5 players per team = 10 players per school.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 players per school * 4 schools = 40 players.

Each school also sent a coach, so the total number of coaches is 4 schools * 1 coach per school = 4 coaches.

The total number of people sent by the schools is the sum of the total number of players and coaches: 40 players + 4 coaches = 44 people.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44}$"
"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone.

Let's start by finding the number of rubies. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, we can subtract 35 from the number of diamonds:

Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35
= 175 - 35
= 140

Next, we know that the number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. So, we can multiply the number of rubies by 2:

Number of emeralds = 2 * Number of rubies
= 2 * 140
= 280

Finally, we can add up the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to find the total number of gems:

Total number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds
= 175 + 140 + 280
= 595

The final answer is 595."

"To find the average square footage of each level of the sandcastle, we need to calculate the total square footage of all levels and divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can express this as a geometric sequence:

Level 1: 16
Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8
Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4
Level 4: 4 / 2 = 2

The sum of the square footage of all levels can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum, a is the first term (16), r is the common ratio (1/2), and n is the number of terms (4).

S = 16 * (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2)
S = 16 * (1 - 1/16) / (1/2)
S = 16 * (15/16) / (1/2)
S = 16 * (15/16) * 2
S = 30

Now, we can find the average square footage by dividing the total square footage by the number of levels:

Average = S / n
= 30 / 4
= 7.5

"To calculate the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the amount of food used in the first 180 days and the amount used for the rest of the year.

For the first 180 days, Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food used in the first 180 days is:
1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

For the rest of the year (365 - 180 = 185 days), Cecilia feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food used in the rest of the year is:
2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

The total amount of food used in the first year is:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags used in the first year is:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

"To find the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David, we need to first determine how much laundry each person does.

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Let's say David does x pounds of laundry. Then, Sarah does 4x pounds of laundry.

We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so we can set up the equation:

4x = 400

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 400 / 4
x = 100

So, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can find his laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2:

Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"

"To find out how much water was left, we need to calculate the total amount of water initially and then subtract the amount given to the girls and the boy.

The total amount of water is 24 liters. Since the two girls each got 1/6 of the water, we can calculate it as follows:

Total water = 24 liters
Girls' share = 2 * (1/6) = 2/6 = 1/3 = 8 liters

Now, we subtract the water the boy got from the total:

Water left = Total water - (Girls' share + Boy's share)
= 24 - (8 + 6)
= 24 - 14
= 10 liters

Therefore, there were 10 liters of water left."
"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he had initially and then subtract the number of stickers he gave away and used.

Charlie initially had 10 stickers. He then acquired 21 more stickers from a store and received 23 stickers as a birthday gift. This gives us a total of 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers.

However, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card. To find the total number of stickers he has left, we need to subtract the number of stickers he gave away and used from the total number of stickers he had.

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's say the number of games lost is x. Since they won 8 more than they lost, the number of games won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22. So, the sum of the number of games won and lost is 22.

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by adding 8 to x:
x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of shirts he has from each vacation.

Gene was 23 years old when he started vacationing and is now 34 years old. So, the number of years he has been vacationing is 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of shirts (and thus quilt blocks) is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44}$"
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the duration of each ring and add them up.

The first time it rang for 4 times. 
The second time it rang for 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.
The third time it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of times the alarm rang: 
4 (first time) + 12 (second time) + 6 (third time) = 22

The alarm rang 22 times in total."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the increase in her salary for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

Year 8:
Increase = 10% of $1169.23 = 0.1 * $1169.23 = $116.923
Salary after 8 years = $1169.23 + $116.923 = $1286.153

Year 9:
Increase = 10% of $1286.153 = 0.1 * $1286.153 = $128.6153
Salary after 9 years = $1286.153 + $128.6153 = $1414.7683

Year 10:
Increase = 10% of $1414.7683 = 0.1 * $1414.7683 = $141.47683
Salary after 10 years = $1414.7683 + $141.47683 = $1556.24513

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of pets Cindy has as 'x'. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia's pets can be represented as 'x + 2'. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan's pets can be represented as '3(x + 2)'.

We are given that Cindy has 4 pets, so we can set up the equation: x = 4.

Now, we can substitute the value of x into the expressions for Marcia and Jan's pets: Marcia's pets = 4 + 2 = 6, and Jan's pets = 3(4 + 2) = 18.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we can use the information given about the age differences between the siblings.

Let's denote the age of Jackson as J, Amy as A, Corey as C, and James as M. We know that M = 10 and M = C - 1, so we can find C by adding 1 to M: C = M + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11.

We also know that A = C - 2, so A = 11 - 2 = 9.

Lastly, we know that A = J + 5, so J = A - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first determine the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Next, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we can add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he watched on other days and subtract that from the total time he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total time watched on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is equal to 90 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched. To do this, we divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes. 90 / 30 = 3.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many cookies, so he bakes 2x cookies. However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually bakes 2x + 15 cookies. He then drops 5 cookies, leaving him with 2x + 15 - 5 cookies.

We know that he has a total of 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

To solve for x, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 100

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of x:

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which Julia's boat is taking on water and then multiply it by the total distance she rows to reach the shore.

First, let's find Julia's rowing speed. We know that she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. To find her speed, we can divide the distance by the time:

Speed = Distance / Time
= 20 feet / 16 seconds
= 1.25 feet/second

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. To find the rate at which the boat takes on water, we can divide 2 liters by 10 feet:

Rate of water intake = 2 liters / 10 feet
= 0.2 liters/foot

Since Julia rows at a speed of 1.25 feet/second, we can find the total distance she rows to reach the shore:

Distance = Speed * Time
= 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds
= 80 feet

Now, we can find the total amount of water taken on by the boat:

Total water taken on = Rate of water intake * Distance

"To find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we need to divide the total number of photographs on Jamal's phone by 6, since his phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.

Let's denote the number of photographs on Jamal's phone as J and the number of photographs on Brittany's phone as B. We know that J = 1800 and B = J / 6.

We are also given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This can be represented as B = 50x, where x is the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

Since B = J / 6, we can substitute B in the equation B = 50x to get J / 6 = 50x.

Now, we can substitute J = 1800 into the equation to get 1800 / 6 = 50x.

Simplifying the equation, we get 300 = 50x.

Dividing both sides by 50, we get x = 300 / 50 = 6.

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

"To find Adrien's current salary, we need to calculate 30% of his old salary and add it to his old salary.

30% of $40000 = 0.3 * 40000 = $12000
Adrien's current salary = $40000 + $12000 = $52000

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$40000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30769.23

Now, we need to find Lylah's current salary. Since her salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate 40% of her old salary and add it to her old salary.

40% of $30769.23 = 0.4 * 30769.23 = $12307.69
Lylah's current salary = $30769.23 + $12307.69 = $43077.92

Now, we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their current salaries.

Total distance covered in 7 hours = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters as x. We know that Jennie stamped one-third of the letters needing stamps, which is 60. So, the number of letters she stamped is 60 / 3 = 20.

We are also given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x + 20 = 30

To solve for x, we can subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

x = 30 - 20
x = 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as x. We know that she initially had some spoons, her husband gave her 5 spoons, and she used 3 spoons to sample her stew. In the end, she had a total of 12 spoons.

We can set up an equation based on the information:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Combine like terms:

x + 2 = 12

Subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 10

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages.

The number of fish sausages is 6 more than the number of chicken sausages. So, we can represent the number of fish sausages as 38 + 6.

Number of fish sausages = 38 + 6
Number of fish sausages = 44

Total number of sausages = Number of chicken sausages + Number of fish sausages
Total number of sausages = 38 + 44
Total number of sausages = 82

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends, we can simply add the number of friends Amy and Lily have. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, we can represent Amy's friends as 50 + 20, which equals 70.

Now, we add the number of friends Amy and Lily have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The total number of friends they have together is 120."
"To find the total cost of the items Dillon is buying, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, we know that a pepper costs 15$. Since a watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * 15 = 45$. 

An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is 45 - 5 = 40$.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dillon is buying:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers: 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges: 10 * 40 = 400$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$.

The final answer is: $880"
"To calculate the profit, we need to find the total time spent on patients and the total revenue from patients and doctors.

First, let's calculate the total time spent on patients. There are 500 patients per day, and each patient is seen for 24 minutes. So, the total time spent on patients is:

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:

12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital charges the doctors $150 per hour, and the hospital charges the patients $200 per hour. The total revenue from patients is:

500 patients * $200/patient = $100,000

The total revenue from doctors is:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from patients and doctors:

$100,000 + $30,000 = $130,000

Since there is no cost mentioned for the hospital, the profit is:

$130,000 - $0 = $130,000

The hospital makes a profit of $130,000."
"To find the number of elves left, we need to calculate the number of elves that quit after children vomit on them and then subtract that from the initial number of elves. 

A third of the elves quit, which is 60 / 3 = 20 elves. So, 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the remaining 40 elves: 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

The number of elves left is 30."
"To find the total expenditure, we need to add the expenditure in May and June. 

Expenditure in May = $500
Expenditure in June = $500 - $60 = $440

The final answer is: $940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.
They both rode the luge 2 times, so they used 2 * 6 * 2 = 24 tickets.

In total, they used 12 + 24 + 24 = 60 tickets.

The total number of tickets used that day is 60."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to calculate the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday first.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

The total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Since the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, we can subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

41 - 28 = 13

Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To calculate the total cost of car washes in a year, we need to multiply the number of car washes per month by the number of months in a year and then multiply by the cost of each car wash.

Let's break it down step by step:

Number of car washes per month: 4
Number of months in a year: 12

Total car washes in a year = 4 car washes/month * 12 months/year = 48 car washes/year

Cost of each car wash: $15

Total cost of car washes in a year = 48 car washes/year * $15/car wash = $720/year

The final answer is: $720"
"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to first determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Since Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, we can set up the equation:

Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5
Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to calculate two thirds of the total number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to add up the cost of each item and then apply the delivery fee and tip.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:

2 subs at $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
2 bags of chips at $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
2 cookies at $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

Total cost of the order: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost:

Delivery fee: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the total cost:

$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we need to add the $5.00 tip:

$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To find the total number of questions Mark completed, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed in each test.

For the first test, Mark completed 5 questions per hour for 8 hours, so he completed 5 * 8 = 40 questions.

For the second test, Mark completed 5 questions per hour for 6 hours, so he completed 5 * 6 = 30 questions.

In total, Mark completed 40 + 30 = 70 questions.

Since the first test had 75 questions and Mark completed 70, he left 75 - 70 = 5 questions incomplete.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's represent the number of blue gumballs as 'b' and the number of pink gumballs as 'p'. We are given that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be written as an equation:

p = 4b + 22

We are also given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so we can substitute b = 12 into the equation:

p = 4(12) + 22
p = 48 + 22
p = 70

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first determine the number of semi-automatic cars. We know that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. 

The number of semi-automatic cars can be found by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars: 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4.

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100: (4 / 20) * 100 = 20%.

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of queens as Q. Since there are twice as many babies as queens, the number of babies is 2Q. And since there are twice as many worker bees as babies, the number of worker bees is 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can set up the equation: Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. Combining like terms, we get 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we find that Q = 100. Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of worker bees: 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400.

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400."
"To calculate the total amount of money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to multiply the number of hours he works in a week by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would work 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

His hourly wage is $10, so his total earnings in a week would be 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 in a week if he spent his video game time working.

Final answer: $140"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the tax on non-food items and add it to the total cost of food items.

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total non-food items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Tax on non-food items: 10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

Total cost of non-food items with tax: $10 + $1 = $11

Food items: 
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total food items: $2 + $3 = $5

Total cost of everything: $11 (non-food items) + $5 (food items) = $16

"To calculate Kim's profit, we need to find the total expenses and subtract it from his total income.

Kim has 8 clients, and each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, and the cost of cloths is $5 per pack.

Total bottles of bleach needed = 8 clients * 2 bottles per client = 16 bottles
Total cost of bleach = 16 bottles * $2 per bottle = $32

Total packs of cloths needed = 8 clients * 1 pack per client = 8 packs
Total cost of cloths = 8 packs * $5 per pack = $40

Total expenses = Total cost of bleach + Total cost of cloths
Total expenses = $32 + $40
Total expenses = $72

Total income = $92
Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

"To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per year and then divide it by the frequency of harvesting.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples per year:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples/year

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to multiply the total number of pineapples per year by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year):
1000 pineapples/year * 4 = 4000 pineapples/year

So, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.
The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first box, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box:
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

The final answer is: 2125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Debra starts by observing 30 bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees. 

Next, in the following 6 hours, twice as many bees as the initial 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees. 

The total number of bees that left before the last 6 hours is 30 + 60 = 90 bees. 

In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return to the hive. Since 15 bees returned in the previous 6 hours, 90 - 15 = 75 bees return in the last 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, she must have given the cashier $22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the number of friends James has, we can use a simple ratio-based approach. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can set up a proportion to represent this relationship.

Let's denote the number of friends Dorothy has as ""x"". Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can write the equation:

Charlie's friends = 3x
We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation:

12 = 3x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 12 / 3
x = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4:

James' friends = 4x
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the time Tim will be waiting for Steve, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to get home and then find the difference between their times.

Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is equivalent to 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet. His speed is 440 feet per minute, so his time is 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is equivalent to 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet. His speed is 264 feet per minute, so his time is 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

Since Steve finishes first, we need to find the difference between their times to determine how long Tim will be waiting for Steve. The time Tim will be waiting is 40 - 36 = 4 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. So, the remaining fries after the seagull ate 7 fries is 14 - 7 = 7.

Then, three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total. The remaining fries after the pigeons ate 9 fries is 7 - 9 = -2. However, since we can't have a negative number of fries, we need to re-evaluate the previous step.

Let's re-evaluate the step where the seagull ate 7 fries. If the seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, then the seagull ate 7 fries, and the remaining fries after the seagull ate 7 fries is 14 - 7 = 7.

However, we know that the pigeons ate 9 fries, which is more than the remaining fries after the seagull ate 7 fries. This means that the seagull didn't eat half of the fries that Dave ate. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's say the original amount of fries is x. The seagull ate 7 fries, and the remaining fries after the seagull ate 7 fries is x - 7. Then, three pigeons ate 9 fries, and the remaining fries after the pigeons ate 9 fries is (x - 7) - 9 = x - 16.

We know that a raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, so the raccoon ate (2/3)(x - 16). The remaining fries after the raccoon ate 2/3 of the fries is (1/3)(x - 16).

We also know that ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, (1/3)(x - 16) - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get x - 16 - 3 = 15. Then, we can add 16 to both sides to get x = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them up.

Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, so he spends 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 days, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.

He also has 2 classes of 2 hours each on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so he spends 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 days, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 9 * 16 = 144 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 8 * 16 = 128 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

The total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{272}$"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good and add them together.

First, let's calculate the total length of the rolls. Since there are 300 rolls, each 4 inches long, we can multiply the number of rolls by the length of each roll:

300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the rolls to feet by dividing by 12:

1200 inches / 12 inches/foot = 100 feet

Next, let's calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants. There are 120 croissants, each 6 inches long:

120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches

We can convert the length of the croissants to feet by dividing by 12:

720 inches / 12 inches/foot = 60 feet

Now, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes. There are 60 baguettes, each 2 feet long:

60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Finally, we add the lengths of all the baked goods together:

100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet

The total length of the baked goods is 280 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month. 

First, let's add up the monthly requirement:
200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to multiply the monthly requirement by 2:
700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas."
"To determine the winner of the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. Since he's running back and forth, we can consider this as 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, his total distance is 15 * 2 * 100 yards = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so her total distance is 34 * (100 + 80) yards = 34 * 180 yards = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is greater than 3000 yards, Kelly wins.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 6120 - 3000 = 3120 yards.

The final answer is: 3120"

"To determine the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond, we need to consider the initial number of tadpoles and the changes that occurred.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 tadpoles came out of hiding, and 2 tadpoles hid under a rock. To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see now, we subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the total number of tadpoles initially.

Let's calculate the number of tadpoles Finn can see now:

11 (initial tadpoles) - 6 (tadpoles that came out) + 0 (tadpoles hiding under a rock) = 5

Therefore, Finn can see 5 tadpoles in the pond now.

"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Additionally, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Total number of fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

"To calculate the price of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to find the price after each 2-month period.

Initial price = $20
Increase after 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Increase after 4 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

Increase after 6 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Increase after 8 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.91
Price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47

Increase after 10 months = 20% of $41.47 = 0.20 * $41.47 = $8.29
Price after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76

Increase after 12 months = 20% of $49.76 = 0.20 * $49.76 = $9.95
Price after 12 months = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71

Increase after 14 months = 20% of $59.71 = 0.20 * $59.71 = $11.94
Price after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65

Increase after 16 months = 20% of $71.65 = 0.20 * $71.65 = $14.33
Price after 16 months = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98

Increase after 18 months = 20% of $85.98 = 0.20 * $85.98 = $17.20
Price after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18

Increase after 20 months = 20% of $103.18 = 0.20 * $103.18 = $20.64
Price after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82

Increase after 22 months = 20% of $123.82 = 0.20 * $123.82 = $24.76
Price after 22 months = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58

Increase after 24 months = 20% of $148.58 = 0.20 * $148.58 = $29.72
Price after 24 months = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30

Increase after 26 months = 20% of $178.30 = 0.20 * $178.30 = $35.66
Price after 26 months = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96

Increase after 28 months = 20% of $213.96 = 0.20 * $213.96 = $42.79
Price after 28 months = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75

Increase after 30 months = 20% of $256.75 = 0.20 * $256.75 = $51.55
Price after 30 months = $256.75 + $51.55 = $308.30

Increase after 32 months = 20% of $308.30 = 0.20 * $308.30 = $61.66
Price after 32 months = $308.30 + $61.66 = $369.96

Increase after 34 months = 20% of $369.96 = 0.20 * $369.96 = $73.99
Price after 34 months = $369.96 + $73.99 = $443.95

Increase after 36 months = 20% of $443.95 = 0.20 * $443.95 = $88.79
Price after 36 months = $443.95 + $88.79 = $532.74

The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $532.74."
"To find the total cost of all the toys, we need to establish the cost of each item relative to the others.

Let's denote the cost of an action figure as A, the cost of a red car as R, and the cost of the doll as D.

We know that:
1. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so D = 3A.
2. One red car costs $4, so R = $4.
3. The cost of an action figure is $5, so A = $5.

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation D = 3A to find the cost of the doll:
D = 3 * $5
D = $15

Now, we can find the total cost of all toys:
Total cost = (5 red cars * $4) + (3 action figures * $5) + (1 doll * $15)
Total cost = (5 * $4) + (3 * $5) + $15
Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15
Total cost = $50

The final answer is: $50"
"To figure out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to compare the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, she'll lose 3 hours of freelance work, which would result in a loss of $35 per hour. So, the total loss would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's compare this to the cost of hiring the accountant, which is $90.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the total loss:

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

Final answer: $15"
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the accessories she bought.

The total cost of the accessories is:
โฌ1090 (computer) + โฌ157 (scanner) + โฌ74 (CD burner) + โฌ102 (printer) = โฌ1423

Elvira's budget is โฌ1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

โฌ1500 - โฌ1423 = โฌ77

So, Elvira will have โฌ77 left for her clothing.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote Seth's current age as x and Brooke's current age as y. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this as x = 2y.

In 2 years, Seth's age will be x + 2, and Brooke's age will be y + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 + y + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

x + y + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

x + y = 24

Now, substitute x = 2y into the equation:

2y + y = 24

Combine like terms:

3y = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 8

Now that we know Brooke's current age, we can find Seth's current age by substituting y = 8 into the equation x = 2y:

x = 2(8)

x = 16

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has and then add $2.

We know Ethel has $8. Twice the amount of money Ethel has is 2 x $8 = $16. Since Jimmy has $2 more than twice the amount of money Ethel has, we add $2 to $16, resulting in $16 + $2 = $18.

The final answer is $18."
"To find the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately.

Pancho walks 20 miles a day on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. So, the total miles he walks on weekdays is 5 * 20 = 100 miles.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles a day, and there are 2 weekend days in a week. So, the total miles he walks on weekends is 2 * 10 = 20 miles.

To find the total miles he walks in a week, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 x $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
$25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

Insects: 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs
Mutant invertebrates: 3 mutant invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs

The final answer is: 1210"
"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of each bird.

We know that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old.

Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can add up the ages of all four birds: 8 (Sally Thirty-two) + 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To calculate how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to find out how much she pays per month and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's add up the minimum payments for her debts:
Minimum payment for student loans: $300
Minimum payment for credit card: $200
Minimum payment for mortgage: $500
Total minimum payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 x $1000 = $500

Now, let's add the 50% increase to the total minimum payment:
$1000 + $500 = $1500

This is the amount Jessica pays per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply this amount by 12:
$1500 x 12 = $18,000

"To find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato, then multiply it by the number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
Total time to prepare one potato: 1.5 minutes + 5 seconds = 1.5 + 0.0833 = 1.5833 minutes

Now, we multiply the total time to prepare one potato by the number of potatoes:
60 potatoes * 1.5833 minutes/potato = 94.999 minutes

Converting the total time to seconds: 94.999 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 5699.94 seconds

So, it will take Billy approximately 5699.94 seconds to finish prepping the potatoes.

Final answer: 5699.94"
"To find out how much Juan and his brother Carlos spent on lemons, we need to calculate the total cost of lemons for the amount of lemonade they sold.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and profit is the difference between revenue and cost, we can set up an equation:

Revenue - Cost = Profit
$10 - Cost = $25

To find the total cost, we can add $25 to both sides of the equation:
$10 + $25 = $35

This is the total cost for 1 gallon. Since they need lemons and sugar for each gallon, the cost of lemons and sugar for 1 gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

To find the total cost of lemons, we can divide the total cost by 1 gallon:
$35 รท 1 gallon = $35 per gallon

Since they need lemons for 1 gallon, the cost of lemons is $35.

The final answer is: $35"
"To find the number of Chinese girls, we need to first find the total number of Chinese participants. 

We know that the total number of Asians is 240, and the number of Japanese participants is 80. To find the number of Chinese participants, we subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of Asians.

Number of Chinese = Total number of Asians - Number of Japanese
= 240 - 80
= 160

Since we are given that the number of Chinese boys is 60, we can find the number of Chinese girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of Chinese girls = Total number of Chinese - Number of Chinese boys
= 160 - 60
= 100

Therefore, the number of Chinese girls on the team is 100."
"To find out how much Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations, we need to calculate the amount he spends and subtract it from his total income.

Zaid's monthly income is 6000$.

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = $1500.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = $2000.

The total amount spent so far is $1500 + $2000 = $3500.

The remaining amount is $6000 - $3500 = $2500.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * $2500 = $1250.

The amount left after donation is $2500 - $1250 = $1250.

He gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700, so the total amount spent on these is $200 + $700 = $900.

The amount left after these expenses is $1250 - $900 = $350.

Therefore, Zaid will have $350 left after all these expenses and donations."
"To find the total number of crabs, we need to first find out how many crabs each person has.

Since Bo has 40 crabs, and Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, we can calculate Monic's crabs by subtracting 4 from Bo's total: 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so we add 10 to Monic's total: 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can add up the number of crabs each person has: 
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find the total amount Lloyd earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each week and add them together.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of red roses, we need to first determine the number of white carnations. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. Let's represent the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, we can set up the equation:

5x = 200

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, the number of red roses is 4x:

Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps.

Let's denote Jan's current age as J, Mark's current age as M, and Jean's current age as E. We know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can write an equation: E = M + 2.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. We can express this as: M - 2 = (J / 2) + 5.

We are given that Jan is 30 years old, so we can substitute J = 30 into the second equation: M - 2 = (30 / 2) + 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get: M - 2 = 15 + 5, which simplifies to M - 2 = 20.

Adding 2 to both sides, we get: M = 22.

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age by substituting M into the first equation: E = 22 + 2.

E = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together.

The first runner runs 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team's time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (6).

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes (2, 4, and 6) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (6).

Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = (2/6) * (2/6) = 4/36 = 1/9 = 0.1111

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities and express it as a percentage.

Difference in probability = (0.5 - 0.1111) * 100% โ 0.3889 * 100% โ 38.89%

So, Jerry is approximately 38.89% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To find the total number of apples picked, we can use simple arithmetic. Jenna's mom picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. This means Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

The total number of apples picked is the sum of the apples picked by Jenna and her mom. So, we add 20 (mom's apples) and 10 (Jenna's apples).

Total number of apples picked = 20 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the total number of apples picked is 30."
"To find the number of rats in each cage, we need to first determine the total number of straw pieces used for the rats. We know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw, and a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw. The total straw used for these animals is 50 (hamsters) + 20 (rabbits) = 70.

Since the total straw used for all animals is 160, the straw used for the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

Now, we know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. To find the number of straw pieces per cage, we can divide the total straw used for rats by 3:

Straw pieces per cage = 90 / 3 = 30

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can divide the straw pieces per cage by 6 to find the number of rats in each cage:

Number of rats in each cage = 30 / 6 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the interest, we need to first calculate the interest for 1 month, then multiply it by 3.

Interest for 1 month = Principal * Rate
Interest for 1 month = $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

Total interest for 3 months = Interest for 1 month * 3
Total interest for 3 months = $2 * 3 = $6

Now, we add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.
Amount to be paid = Principal + Total interest
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6

"To find the number of bags of wheat the trader sold, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold: 
Total Revenue = 30x

The total cost is the cost of buying the bags plus the cost of transportation:
Total Cost = 20x + 2x
Total Cost = 22x

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
400 = 30x - 22x
400 = 8x

To find the number of bags sold, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 400 / 8
x = 50

The trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"To find the total cost of the food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets.

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

The total cost of the rides is $66.

Now, we need to find the total cost of all expenses.
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.
Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts. 

First, we know that Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2 to find out how many sentences he edits for each publisher.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. To find out how much Mark earns from Publisher A, we can multiply the number of sentences by the rate:

500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can multiply the amount Mark earns from Publisher A by 2:

2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we can add the amounts he earns from both publishers:

"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to multiply the number of acres by the number of tons produced per acre, and then multiply that by the number of barrels produced per ton.

The farm has 10 acres, and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate the total number of barrels as follows:

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. So, he used 7 * 2 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. So, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

For dinner, Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (dinner) = 31 slices of cheese.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens in each color and add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of pens in the blue bags:
6 bags of blue pens * 9 pens per bag = 54 blue pens

Next, let's calculate the number of pens in the red bags:
2 bags of red pens * 6 pens per bag = 12 red pens

Now, let's add the number of pens of each color:
22 green pens + 10 yellow pens + 54 blue pens + 12 red pens = 98 pens

Janet now has 98 pens."
"To find the required score on the sixth test, we need to calculate the total score of the six tests. Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we'll first find the total score of the first five tests and then determine the required score for the sixth test.

The total score of the first five tests is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438. To find the average of the six tests, we'll multiply the desired average by 6: 93 * 6 = 558.

Now, we'll subtract the total score of the first five tests from the desired total score: 558 - 438 = 120. This is the required score for the sixth test.

The final answer is 120."
"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the kilometers he rode in two different periods.

In the first period, Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks. 
This can be calculated as 5 times/week * 4 weeks = 20 times
Then, multiply the number of times by the distance he rode each time: 20 times * 25 kilometers/time = 500 kilometers

In the second period, Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks.
This can be calculated as 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 6 times
Then, multiply the number of times by the distance he rode each time: 6 times * 60 kilometers/time = 360 kilometers

Total kilometers = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers

The final answer is: $\boxed{860}$"
"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought 3 times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 x 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 x 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To find the cost of each cup, we need to first calculate the total cost of 20 dozen cups. We know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is 3 plates. The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

20 dozen cups = 20 * 12 cups = 240 cups
Cost of 20 dozen cups = $18000 - $1200
Cost of 20 dozen cups = $16800

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups:

Cost per cup = $16800 / 240 cups
Cost per cup = $70

The final answer is: $70"
"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 = $50.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $50 - $10 = $40 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $40, we can divide $40 by $5, which is 8 sessions.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing sessions. Since she earns $4 per session, we can divide $40 by $4, which is 10 sessions.

Since 8 babysitting sessions would not be enough to cover the cost, we need to find the least common multiple of 8 and 10. The least common multiple of 8 and 10 is 40.

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 40 / 4 = 10 times to earn $40.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's represent the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is 42, and the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, while the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. This can be represented by the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all its sides. Since the park is a rectangle, we add the lengths of all four sides:

Perimeter = 2(length + width)
Perimeter = 2(1.5 + 6)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the number of customers on the first two days.

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. Since Sloane counted 50 more customers on the second day, the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50), which equals 100 + 150. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (x + 50) = 250

Combine like terms:

2x + 50 = 250

Subtract 50 from both sides:

2x = 200

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 100

Now that we know the number of customers on the first day (x = 100), we can find the number of customers on the second day (x + 50 = 100 + 50 = 150).

The total number of customers on the third day is given as 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we can subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day:

500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250

Simplify the expression:

500 - 250 = 250

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have two pools, both leaking at 4 gallons/minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Then, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in both pools has decreased by 4 gallons/minute for the past 4 minutes. So, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Then, the big pool has 4y gallons of water now.

We can set up an equation based on the information: 2x - 16 = 4y. We also know that the small pool lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has x - 16 gallons of water. We are given that the small pool has y gallons of water now, so we can set up the equation: x - 16 = y.

We can solve the system of equations by substituting x - 16 for y in the first equation: 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16). Simplifying, we get 2x - 16 = 4x - 64. Adding 64 to both sides, we get 2x + 48 = 4x. Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get 48 = 2x. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 24.

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation x - 16 = y: 24 - 16 = y, so y = 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to subtract the total cost of the items she wants to buy from her hourly wage.

Total cost of items = $320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00

Now, divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

$352.00 รท $8.00 = 44 hours

Lori needs to work 44 hours to make her purchase."
"To find the remaining balance Janeth owes, we need to calculate the total amount she borrowed and the total amount she pays.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. So, the total amount she borrowed is $2000 + 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

Total amount borrowed = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. To find the total amount she pays, we multiply the monthly payment by the number of months.

Total amount paid = $165 * 12
= $1980

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount borrowed to find the remaining balance.

Remaining balance = Total amount borrowed - Total amount paid
= $2200 - $1980
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias.

Let's denote the number of roses as R and the number of dahlias as D. We know that R = 4 and D = R + 7. 

We can substitute the value of R into the equation for D: D = 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding R and D: Total = R + D = 4 + 11 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the average age of the three in three years, we need to find their current ages and add them up, then divide by 3.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. This gives us 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Next, we can calculate Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3. This gives us 3 * 21 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

The average age of the three in three years will be (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

We know that Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. 68 + 44 + 85 = 197

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the points scored by the other three students from the total points.

251 - 197 = 54

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points."

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Then, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, we multiply 30 by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

Now, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

Final answer: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias.

The number of geraniums is given as 90. Since Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias by subtracting 40 from 90.

Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias.

Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

He starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

He loses 8 water type cards, so the new number of water type cards is 40 - 8 = 32.
He buys 14 grass type cards, so the new number of grass type cards is 20 + 14 = 34.

Now, the total number of cards is 90 - 8 + 14 = 96.

The number of water type cards is 32.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%. Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"To calculate the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to add up the costs of each item.

The base burrito costs $6.50. Chad adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, and avocado for $1.00. He also gets 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 x $0.25 = $0.50. The upgrade adds $3.00 to his meal.

Let's add up the costs:
$6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50
$8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50
$9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50
$10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00
$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Since Chad has a gift card for $5.00, we subtract that from the total:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00."
"To determine the time it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of completing the puzzle.

Kalinda can complete 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can complete half as many pieces per minute, which is 2 pieces per minute. Together, they can complete 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the time it will take them to complete the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces (360) by their combined rate (6 pieces per minute).

Time = Total pieces / Combined rate
Time = 360 / 6
Time = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours by dividing by 60.

Time (in hours) = 60 minutes / 60
Time (in hours) = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

"To find the number of watermelons ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home.

Now, let's find the number of watermelons remaining on the farm.

Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. To find the number of watermelons ready for harvest, we need to calculate 3/4 of 84.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest.

To find the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total remaining watermelons.

Watermelons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21

"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes required per week. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we can calculate his weekly consumption as follows:

Steve's weekly consumption = 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

His girlfriend's weekly consumption = 42 tomatoes/week / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total weekly consumption by 3 to find the number of vines needed:

Total weekly consumption = Steve's consumption + girlfriend's consumption = 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes/week

Number of vines needed = Total weekly consumption / 3 = 63 / 3 = 21

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend.

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow the steps below:

First, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as:

Number of students through exit A = 30% of 1000
= 0.3 * 1000
= 300 students

Next, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit A from the total number of students to find the remaining students:

Remaining students = 1000 - 300
= 700 students

Then, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, we can calculate this as:

Number of students through exit B = 3/5 * 700
= (3/5) * 700
= 420 students

Finally, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students to find the number of students who went out through exit C:

Number of students through exit C = Remaining students - Number of students through exit B
= 700 - 420
= 280 students

The number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using algebra to represent the number of candies each person has. Let's use 'R' to represent the number of candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can write an equation:

2R = 54

To find the value of R, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

R = 54 รท 2
R = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find the number of candies James has by adding 6 to Robert's total:

J = R + 6
J = 27 + 6
J = 33

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we can subtract James' total from John's total:

Difference = J - R
= 33 - 27

Therefore, John has 6 more candies than James."
"To find the total number of books Dolly and Pandora will collectively read, we need to consider the books each person has and the books they will read from the other person.

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book, so she will read a total of 2 + 2 = 4 books.

Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book, so she will read a total of 1 + 1 = 2 books.

The total number of books they will collectively read is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

Therefore, the total number of books Dolly and Pandora will collectively read is 6."
"To find the total time Mike spends writing per week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to minutes.

Since Mike receives and sends 3 letters per week, and each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he writes per week is 3 * 5 = 15 pages.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing per week is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.5}$"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left in his phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes he used for his daily call with his boss and add the extra minutes he had.

Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days. So, the total minutes used for this call is:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

He also had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, the total minutes used is:
450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (for other people) = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan:
1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. 

First, let's determine how many fries Griffin had after Kyle took some. Griffin initially had 24 fries, and Kyle took 5, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.

Next, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.

Let's say Ginger gave Griffin x fries. After that, Griffin had 9 + x fries. Colby then took 3 less fries than Kyle, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, Griffin had 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. We can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to solve for x.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

Final answer: 20"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. According to the problem, this difference is equal to twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since we know that there are 14 fish in each aquarium, we can conclude that the correct answer is:

The number of fish in each aquarium is 14."
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we need to find the total hours worked and then apply the discount.

The makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 days a week, so the total hours worked per week is 6 * 4 = 24 hours. Since the movie takes 5 weeks to finish, the total hours worked is 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour, so the total cost without discount is 120 * 250 = $30,000.

A 10% discount is applied to the total cost. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1: 0.1 * 30,000 = $3,000.

The total amount paid is the total cost minus the discount: 30,000 - 3,000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find the total cost of all the party supplies, we need to add up the individual costs of each item.

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

The final answer is $32."
"To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply by the cost per pound.

Number of bags: 4
Weight per bag: 50 pounds
Cost per pound: $1.50

Total weight: 4 * 50 = 200 pounds
Total cost: 200 pounds * $1.50 = $300

The chef spent $300."
"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday, we can multiply her sister's cookies by 4. 

Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies
Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies
Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

Since we know the number of cookies eaten by both Sue and her sister, we can calculate the difference in calories consumed. Given that 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can multiply the total number of cookies eaten by each person by 200.

Calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

To find the difference in calories consumed, we subtract the calories consumed by her sister from the calories consumed by Sue.

Calories consumed by Sue more than her sister = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, the total number of girls is 50% of 3 classes, which is 1.5 classes.

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls is 1.5 * 20 = 30 girls.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

This means that the third class has 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

Since there are 3 classes, the number of boys in each class is 30 / 3 = 10 boys.

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 10."
"To find the number of apps on Travis' tablet now, we need to subtract the number of apps he deleted from the initial number of apps and then add the number of apps he downloaded.

Initial number of apps: 61
Number of apps deleted: 9
Number of apps downloaded: 18

Number of apps now = Initial number of apps - Number of apps deleted + Number of apps downloaded

The final number of apps on Travis' tablet is 70."
"To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to break down the information given.

First, let's calculate the number of wolves and cougars Rick killed each day.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves.

Today, he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.

Now, we add up the total number of animals Rick killed:

Wolves: 10 (last night) + 45 (today) = 55 wolves
Cougars: 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27 cougars

Total number of animals Rick killed: 55 wolves + 27 cougars = 82 animals.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the floor Bill is on now, we need to multiply his starting floor (3) by 4 and add 6.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to calculate the number of times Anne went down the slide first. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we need to first calculate the total number of cows after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows. 

Initially, there were 20 cows in each stall, so the total number of cows in 20 stalls is:
20 stalls * 20 cows/stall = 400 cows

After Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, the total number of cows becomes:
400 cows + 40 cows = 440 cows

Since the cows are divided equally among the 20 stalls, we can divide the total number of cows by 20 to find the number of cows in each stall:
440 cows / 20 stalls = 22 cows/stall

Now, to find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8:
22 cows/stall * 8 stalls = 176 cows

The final answer is: $\boxed{176}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to convert each type of coin to dollars and add them to the value of the dollar bills.

First, let's calculate the value of each type of coin:

- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2

Now, let's add the values together: $1 + $2 + $2 = $5

Adding the value of the dollar bills: $5 + $40 = $45

Therefore, Brady has $45 in his piggy bank."
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.30 (which is equivalent to 30%):

8000 pounds * 0.30 = 2400 pounds

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood to find the weight of the remaining wood:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds.

Final answer: 5600"
"To calculate the total amount Nancy owes, we need to consider the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue. 

The cost of the overdue books can be calculated by multiplying the number of books by the cost per book: 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

Since Nancy has at least one book over a week overdue, she has to pay the flat fee of $2.00.

The total amount Nancy owes is the sum of the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Therefore, Nancy owes a total of $6.00."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using algebra to represent the number of bananas Jamal has. Let's say Jamal has x bananas. Since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, Andrea has x/2 bananas.

We are also given that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can set up the following equations:

Jamal's apples = x - 4
Andrea's apples = (x - 4) + 8
Andrea's apples = x + 4

We are also given that Andrea has 52 apples. So, we can set up the equation:
x + 4 = 52

To solve for x, we can subtract 4 from both sides:
x = 52 - 4
x = 48

Now that we know Jamal has 48 bananas, we can find out how many bananas Andrea has:
Andrea's bananas = x/2
Andrea's bananas = 48/2
Andrea's bananas = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have:
Andrea's total fruits = 52 + 24 = 76
Jamal's total fruits = 48 + 48 = 96

The total number of fruits is 76 + 96 = 172.

The final answer is: $\boxed{172}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we can calculate the total number of cookies she's making and then divide that by 12, since 2 cups of flour are required for a dozen cookies.

Total number of cookies = 36 (today) + 30 (tomorrow) = 66 cookies

Now, we'll divide the total number of cookies by 12 to find out how many cups of flour Carla needs:

66 cookies รท 12 = 5.5 cups

Therefore, Carla will need 5.5 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to calculate two thirds of 9,300 pennies.

Two thirds of 9,300 pennies is (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200 pennies.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply the number of pennies by the value of each penny:

6,200 * $0.01 = $62.

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62."
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has, we can use simple arithmetic. 

First, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box: 5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles.

Therefore, Maddison now has 270 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. 

First, we know Chris has 6 trees. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, we can calculate Ferdinand's trees by dividing Chris's trees by 2. This gives us 6 / 2 = 3 trees for Ferdinand.

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. We know Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. To find this, we multiply Ferdinand's trees by 2 and then add 5. This gives us 2 * 3 + 5 = 11 trees for Harry.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard. To do this, we subtract Ferdinand's trees from Harry's trees: 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 x $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 x $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Total price of the house: $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference is:
$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees and brokerage fee. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, which is 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000.

The total amount paid is the sum of the transfer fees and brokerage fee, which is $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the selling price to find the net proceeds: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

The final answer is: $368,000"
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil and the time it takes to cook the chicken.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. It takes 20 minutes to heat up the oil, and then it takes 40% longer than that. 40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. So, the total time to heat up the oil to 400 degrees is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to warm up the oil. Since it took 28 minutes to heat up the oil, it will take 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.

Finally, we add the time it took to heat up the oil and the time it took to cook the chicken to get the total time. Total time = 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

To find the number of stitches for the two sleeves, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater:
1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:
630 รท 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break down the information given.

The solo song has 54 lines. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, we add up the lines from the song and both scenes: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138.

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. However, the problem doesn't provide that information. 

Let's assume their current ages are x and y. We know that the sum of their ages is 20, so we can write an equation:

x + y = 20

We also know that in 10 years, their ages will be x + 10 and y + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (y + 10) = x + y + 20.

Since x + y = 20, we can substitute this into the equation:

x + y + 20 = 20 + 20
x + y + 20 = 40

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up two equations based on the given information. Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write the equation:
R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, we can substitute R = 6S into the second equation:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old."

"To calculate the total number of people, we need to consider the team members, coaches, and their guests. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, and each team member brings 2 guests. 

First, we calculate the total number of guests: 12 team members * 2 guests/team member = 24 guests. Then, we add the number of coaches to get the total number of people: 24 guests + 3 coaches = 27 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3 to find out how many pizzas are needed: 27 people / 3 people/pizza = 9 pizzas.

The cost of each pizza is $15, so the total cost will be 9 pizzas * $15/pizza = $135.

The final answer is: $135"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to calculate the total space between the topaz gemstones. Since there are 8 topaz gemstones, each 1 inch long, the total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the topaz gemstones take up 8 inches, so the space between the gemstones is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can divide the total space between the gemstones (17 inches) by the length of each bead (1/4 inch) to find the number of beads used:

17 inches รท (1/4 inch) = 17 x 4 = 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"To calculate the total number of stories written, we need to find the number of stories each child wrote in the second week and add them to the number of stories they wrote in the first week.

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories.

In the second week, Alani doubled her stories from the first week, so she wrote 20 x 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen doubled his stories from the first week, so he wrote 40 x 2 = 80 stories.
Margot doubled her stories from the first week, so she wrote 60 x 2 = 120 stories.

Alani: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot: 60 + 120 = 180

The total number of stories written is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To find the brother's age in 3 years, we need to add 3 to his current age. 

The brother's current age is twice Ann's age, and Ann is 9 years old. So, the brother's current age is 9 * 2 = 18 years.

To find the brother's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 18 + 3 = 21 years.

The brother's age in 3 years will be 21 years."
"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left after buying a can of pop, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is 5 x 25 cents = 125 cents.
She also has 2 dimes, which is 2 x 10 cents = 20 cents.

The total amount of money Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents she will have left, we subtract 55 from 145:
145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Since the flag has 76 stars, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

To find the number of rows, we divide 40 by 5, which is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight the truck can carry.

First, calculate the total weight of the flagstones: 
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

Final answer: 3"
"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, we can start by finding the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, we can represent Izzy's medals as 22 - 5 = 17. 

The total number of medals they have together is 22 + 17 = 39. 

Now, we know that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. We can set up the equation: 10x = 39.

To find x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10: x = 39 / 10.

x = 3.9

The total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars first. There are 4 adults and 8 children, so the total number of people is 4 + 8 = 12.

Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16.

Now, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars among the children. There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to determine the total number of minutes she works and then divide that by 10 to find out how many $5 intervals she completes.

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes to get the total minutes worked: 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract 30 minutes from the total minutes she works: 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total minutes worked by 10 to find out how many $5 intervals she completes: 150 รท 10 = 15.

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we can multiply the number of intervals by $5 to find her total earnings: 15 * $5 = $75.

The final answer is $75."
"To find the total points of the three players after the extra points are distributed, we need to calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points, Jim has 3 points less than Mike, which is 21 - 3 = 18 points. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, each player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. So, Mike and Tony get an extra point each, and Jim does not get an extra point.

- Mike's points: 21 + 1 = 22
- Jim's points: 18
- Tony's points: 42 + 1 = 43

Now, we add up the points of all three players to find the total points:
22 + 18 + 43 = 83

The final answer is 83."
"To determine the number of unwashed oranges, we need to calculate the total number of oranges washed by the sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washed 8 oranges. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. Therefore, he washed 4 oranges.

The total number of oranges washed by the sons is 8 (oldest son) + 4 (youngest son) = 12 oranges.

Since Will bought 15 oranges initially, the number of unwashed oranges is 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To find the total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity on both days and add them together.

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the total count of each activity:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

The final answer is: $\boxed{370}$"
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg รท 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

The rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and then add the crates sold over the weekend.

Crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday: 15 + 12 + 18 = 45
Crates sold over the weekend: 20
Total crates sold: 45 + 20 = 65

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we need to subtract the total crates sold from the target to find the difference.

120 - 65 = 55

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the final cost of the desk, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carmen spent. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time. Since there were 3 other people who bid once, the bids rose 3 times. 

The first bid was $200. 
The second bid was $200 + $50 = $250.
The third bid was $250 + $50 = $300.
The fourth bid was $300 + $50 = $350.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $300, $350, and $400. 

The final bid was $400 + $50 = $450.

Carmen's total cost is $200 + $300 + $350 + $400 = $1250.

The final answer is: $1250"
"To calculate the total cost of driving per year, we need to consider two main components: the cost of driving and the bonus given to the driver.

The cost of driving is calculated by multiplying the total miles driven per year by the cost per mile. Since John drives 60 miles per day (30 miles to work and 30 miles back) and works 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. With 50 weeks in a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year. The cost of driving is then 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000.

Additionally, John receives a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800.

The total cost of driving per year is the sum of the cost of driving and the bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to first find out how many minutes he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the combined time by 2.

2 x 39 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the tabloid.

Since the tabloid is folded in half, we have two sides: left and right. 

- The left side has 16 pages (pages 1-16).
- The right side has 16 pages (pages 17-32).

Since each side has 16 pages, and we have two sides, we need 2 pieces of paper to make one side of the tabloid. 

Therefore, to make a 32-page tabloid, we need 2 pieces of paper for the left side and 2 pieces of paper for the right side, making a total of 4 pieces of paper.

The correct answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to subtract the money she spent from the total amount she brought.

Annika brought $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

Total money spent = $25 + $10 = $35

Now, let's subtract the total money spent from the initial amount:
$50 - $35 = $15

Annika has $15 left.

Final answer: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine the number of books she sold in the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that she has 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

Since we know the total number of books sold in the first two years (200) and the number of books sold in the first year (90), we can find the number of books sold in the second year by subtracting 90 from 200: 200 - 90 = 110.

Now that we know she sold 110 books in the second year, we can calculate the total amount of money she earned in the second year by multiplying the number of books sold (110) by the price per book (20$: 110 * 20 = 2200.

The final answer is: $2200"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in April.

Watson works 10 hours a day and earns $10 per hour, so his daily earnings are $100. Since April has 30 days, his total earnings for the month would be $100 * 30 = $3000.

Additionally, he gets a $300 bonus for the whole month, so his total earnings for April would be $3000 + $300 = $3300.

The final answer is: $3300"
"To find the number of people John lost to, we need to calculate 20 x 0.2 (since 80% is equivalent to 0.8).

20 x 0.8 = 16

So, John lost to 16 people."
"To find the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning. Two-thirds of 60 loaves is equal to (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

Next, we subtract the morning sales from the total number of loaves to find the number of loaves left: 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, we divide the remaining loaves by 2: (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

The loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, so we divide the 10 loaves by 2: 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week. 

Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide 8 by 4 to find his weekly weight loss. 

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

The answer is 4."
"To find the savings, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price, and then subtract the total cost at the discounted price.

The original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26.
The original cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $0.5 = $2.
The total original cost is $26 + $2 = $28.

The discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22.
The discounted cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $0.5 = $2.
The total discounted cost is $22 + $2 = $24.

Savings = Total original cost - Total discounted cost
Savings = $28 - $24
Savings = $4

"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the daily egg consumption of the family members and then multiply it by 7.

There are 3 people who eat 3 eggs each day, so their total daily consumption is 3 x 3 = 9 eggs. 
There are 2 people who eat 2 eggs each day, so their total daily consumption is 2 x 2 = 4 eggs.

The total daily egg consumption is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 x 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find Trent's age, we can use the given information. Since Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now, Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so we can calculate Trent's age as follows:

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"To find the current population of Chile, we need to follow these steps:

First, we know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, we can find Noah's current age by adding 6 to Cera's age.

Noah's current age = Cera's current age + 6
Noah's current age = 46 + 6
Noah's current age = 52

Next, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. We can use this information to find the population of Chile six years ago.

Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * Noah's current age
Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * 52
Population of Chile six years ago = 156,000

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can find the current population by multiplying the population six years ago by 2.

Current population of Chile = Population of Chile six years ago * 2
Current population of Chile = 156,000 * 2
Current population of Chile = 312,000

The final answer is: 312,000"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting the number of players on the defense be 'x'. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. We know that the total number of players is 105. 

So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 
2x + 4x + x = 210
Combine like terms: 7x = 210
Divide both sides by 7: x = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30."
"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people with previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to follow these steps:

Solomon initially bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna and added them to a store that already had 50 marbles. His father then gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

First, we calculate 2/5 of 20, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. Now, we add the marbles from the store to the marbles Solomon bought and his father gave him: 50 (in the store) + 20 (bought) + 8 (given by father) = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight: 78 marbles * 2kgs = 156kgs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth.

Volume = Length x Width x Depth
Volume = 6 ft x 4 ft x 5 ft
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill, the total cost to fill the pool would be:

Total Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
Total Cost = 120 cubic feet x $0.1 per cubic foot
Total Cost = $12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we can break down the problem into smaller parts. 

First, we know that the number of girls is 3 times the number of boys. Since there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

Next, we need to find the number of nongendered children, which is 1/10 of the number of boys. This can be calculated as 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the number of electric poles, we can use the ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 3 electric wires, there is 1 electric pole. 

We know that the total number of electric wires is 45. To find the number of electric poles, we can divide 45 by 3.

45 รท 3 = 15

Since each set of 3 electric wires requires 1 electric pole, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the number of women left at the party, we need to first determine the total number of people who left. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, and we know that 22 men stayed, we can calculate the total number of people who left.

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. Since 1/4 of 'x' left, the number of people who left is x/4. We know that 3 men left, so the number of women who left is x/4 - 3.

We also know that the number of men who stayed is 22, so the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3. Since 3 men left, the number of women who left is x/4 - 3.

We are given that the initial number of women is 15. So, we can set up the equation:

x/4 - 3 = 15 - (number of women who left)

Since we don't know the number of women who left, we can set up another equation using the information that 3 men left:

x/4 = 3 + (number of women who left)

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the value of 'x'. 

First, let's solve the second equation for the number of women who left:
Number of women who left = x/4 - 3

Now, substitute this expression into the first equation:
x/4 - 3 = 15 - (x/4 - 3)

Simplify the equation:
x/4 - 3 = 18 - x/4

Add x/4 to both sides:
2x/4 - 3 = 18

Multiply both sides by 4:
2x - 12 = 72

Add 12 to both sides:
2x = 84

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 42

Now that we know the total number of people is 42, we can find the number of women who left:
Number of women who left = 42/4 - 3
= 10.5 - 3
= 7.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can verify if 7.5 is indeed the correct answer by checking if 7.5 women would leave 3 men.

7.5 women would leave 3 men, so the correct answer is indeed 7.5 women. However, since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to follow the given information:

The magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4. So, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 3 * 24 (assuming each box has 24 pencils) + 2 = 74.

Adding Meg's pencils, the total number of pencils is 74 + 46 = 120.

Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 24 to find the number of boxes needed.

120 / 24 = 5

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.

Final answer: 5"
"To find the total weakening of the coffee, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream.

The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, it means 5 ice cubes were used (65 / 13 = 5). 

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many old records the 5 people brought in. Since each person gets 1 new record for every 2 old records they trade, we can set up a proportion to represent the situation.

Let's say the number of old records the 5 people brought in is x. Since each person gets 1 new record for every 2 old records, the total number of new records they get is x/2.

We know that the total number of new records is 7, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 7

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 7 * 2

x = 14

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior and senior programmers.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The number of senior programmers is the remaining employees, which is 100 - 40 = 60.

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"

Let's break it down step by step:

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in.
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. This means a net gain of 8 - 7 = 1 person at the second stop.

Now, we know that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20. To find the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the net gain at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop.

20 - 1 = 19

Therefore, 19 people got on the bus at the terminal.

"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, we can break down the events step by step.

Initially, Oscar has 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops. Then, he passes 14 out to his friends, resulting in 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops. 

Next, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops. After eating 3 more that night, he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops. Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"To calculate the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to determine the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge. Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge 40% as follows:

40% รท 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes รท 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: 2"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we can follow a simple arithmetic sequence. 

First, we need to add the initial number of lollipops Erin had to the number her mother gave her. This can be represented as 7 + 10. 

7 + 10 = 17

Next, we need to subtract the number of lollipops Erin gave to Ella. This can be represented as 17 - 3.

17 - 3 = 14

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

Final answer: 14"
"To calculate the amount the customer paid, we need to consider the rewards they received and the discount from the coupon.

The customer spent $80 and got $1 off for every $20 spent. Since they spent $80, they got 80 / 20 = 4 rewards. However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the actual rewards they got is 4 * 2 = 8 dollars.

Now, subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: 80 - 8 = 72.

The customer paid $72 on this shopping trip.

Final Answer: The final answer is: $72"
"To compare the two jobs, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Annual salary: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Job B has a higher net pay rate of $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000.

The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we need to calculate 40% of the total number of castles and then divide that number by 2.

40% of 220 castles = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Half of the ruined castles are unmanned, so we divide 88 by 2:

88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

Final Answer: The final answer is 44."
"To calculate the total cost of each offer, we need to add the advance payment and the monthly installments.

Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

First, let's calculate the amount of sugar needed for suckers: 8 batches * 30 ounces per batch = 240 ounces.

Next, we'll calculate the amount of sugar needed for fudge: 1 batch * 70 ounces per batch = 70 ounces.

Now, we'll add the amounts together: 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

Therefore, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the value of each share after the price increase and decrease.

First, we calculate the increase in the first year. The stock price increases by 50%, which means the new price is 150% of the original price. To find 150% of $8, we multiply $8 by 1.5.

$8 * 1.5 = $12

So, the value of each share after the first year is $12.

Next, we calculate the decrease in the second year. The stock price decreases by 25%, which means the new price is 75% of the previous price. To find 75% of $12, we multiply $12 by 0.75.

$12 * 0.75 = $9

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is:

8 shares * $9 per share = $72

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can calculate Thomas's hot dogs as 3 * 2 = 6.

Next, we find out how many hot dogs John ate. Since John ate half the amount Thomas ate, we can calculate John's hot dogs as 6 / 2 = 3.

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. To do this, we subtract the amount Luke ate from the amount John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting x be the number of students in the smallest group. Since the other two groups are equal in number, each of them has 2x students. We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 2x = 200

Combine like terms:

5x = 200

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 40

So, the smallest group has 40 students."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to determine the number of cows and chickens. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, let's represent the number of cows as x. This means the number of chickens is 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 20

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens: 2x = 2(20) = 40 chickens.

Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 x 4 = 80 legs.
Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 x 2 = 80 legs.

The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"To determine the number of balls Josh has left, we need to calculate the total number of balls he had at the end of the fourth week. Since he added 1 ball each week, we can use the formula for an arithmetic sequence:

Total number of balls = 3 + (1 * 4)

This is because he started with 3 balls and added 1 ball for each of the 4 weeks.

Total number of balls = 3 + 4
Total number of balls = 7

However, Josh dropped 3 balls, but 2 were caught, so he lost 1 ball. To find the number of balls he has left, we subtract 1 from the total:

Number of balls left = 7 - 1
Number of balls left = 6

The final answer is 6."
"To find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we need to add the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and the container, and then subtract the weight of the red bird.

The pink frog weighs 50 pounds, the blue beetle weighs 50 pounds, the green toad also weighs 50 pounds, and the yellow snake weighs 60 pounds. The container weighs 20 pounds, and the red bird weighs 30 pounds.

First, we add the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, and yellow snake: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 = 210 pounds.

Next, we add the weight of the container: 210 + 20 = 230 pounds.

Finally, we subtract the weight of the red bird: 230 - 30 = 200 pounds.

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 200 pounds.

"To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to calculate the difference in price between the two.

We know that Juice Box A is $4, Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B is $4 + $5 = $9.

Since Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A, Juice Box C is $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: $11 - $9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To calculate the total number of legs, we need to find the total number of legs from the tables with 4 legs and the tables with 3 legs.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs from the tables with 4 legs: 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of legs from the tables with 3 legs: 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of tables: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs.

The total number of legs in the restaurant's tables is 310."
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is:
4 cookies/day * 5 days = 20 cookies

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is:
1 cookie/day * 7 days = 7 cookies

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is:
20 cookies + 7 cookies = 27 cookies

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is:
36 cookies - 27 cookies = 9 cookies

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, we need to calculate the discount on one shirt and then multiply it by 2.

First, calculate the discount on one shirt: 40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, subtract the discount from the original price of one shirt: $30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, multiply the discounted price by 2: $18 * 2 = $36

The final answer is $36."
"To find the percentage increase in daily revenue, we need to compare the revenue from tractors and silos.

The factory used to sell 10 tractors a day at $100 each, so the daily revenue from tractors was 10 * $100 = $1000.

Now, they sell 5 silos a day at $220 each, so the daily revenue from silos is 5 * $220 = $1100.

The total daily revenue is $1000 + $1100 = $2100.

To find the percentage increase, we'll divide the difference in revenue ($1100 - $1000 = $100) by the original revenue ($1000) and multiply by 100:

($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now."
"To calculate the total yearly cost of dog expenses, we need to break down the costs into their monthly components and then multiply by 12.

First, let's calculate the monthly cost of food. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the weekly cost of food is $25. Multiplying this by 4 gives us the monthly cost of food: $25 * 4 = $100.

Next, we add the monthly cost of treats, which is $20, and the monthly cost of medicine, which is $100. This gives us a total monthly cost of $100 + $20 + $100 = $220.

Now, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12 to get the yearly cost: $220 * 12 = $2,640.

The final answer is: $2640"
"To find the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them up.

Peyton has a one-hour yoga class on Monday, a cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday's yoga, which is 3 hours, a half-hour cheese-tasting event on Wednesday, a museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class, which is 1.5 hours, and two hours of errands on Friday.

Let's add up the hours:
1 hour (Monday) + 3 hours (Tuesday) = 4 hours
4 hours + 0.5 hours (Wednesday) = 4.5 hours
4.5 hours + 1.5 hours (Thursday) = 6 hours
6 hours + 2 hours (Friday) = 8 hours

The total hours of Peyton's after-work activities is 8 hours."
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of pots she needs. Since she needs twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 pots for the roses.

In total, April needs 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

Since she already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of pots she needs from the number she already had: 100 - 90 = 10.

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

Let's break it down step by step:

Initial amount = $36
Amount spent on sweater = $11

Total amount spent = $11 + $4 = $15

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$36 - $15 = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. He also watched 3 different shows that were 2 hours each, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time: 0.3x = 15. Solving for x, we get x = 15 / 0.3 = 50.

This means John spent 50 hours on vacation.

To find the time spent sightseeing, we can calculate 40% of the total time: 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add it to her initial savings.

Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job and worked for 20 hours. Her earnings from the first job are 20 * $10 = $200.

At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and worked for 15 hours. Her earnings from the second job are 15 * $5 = $75.

Now, let's add her initial savings of $80 to her total earnings: $200 + $75 + $80 = $355.

To find out how much she still needs to save, we subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45.

The final answer is $45."
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the height of the second tree. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

The combined height of the two shortest trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shortest trees, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wants to play once, so the total cost for mini-golf is $5. The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride the go-karts twice, so the total cost for go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20. 

The total cost of the activities is $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) = $25. 

Now, let's subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 (budget) - $25 (total cost) = $65.

Since each friend will also get $5 in arcade tokens, we need to subtract that from the remaining budget as well: $65 - $5 = $60.

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend (including the arcade tokens): $60 / $5 = 12.

So, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party."
"To calculate the total amount Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to find the difference between her daily pocket money and the total cost of lollipops.

Daily pocket money: $5
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4
Cost of each lollipop: $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days: $1 * 5 = $5

Since Marisa saves the change, we subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

The final amount Marisa saves in her piggy bank for 5 days is $0."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, he must have had $2 left as change. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 initially.

Now, we know that Billy spent $8 on gumballs, so he must have spent $10 - $8 = $2 on candy.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide the amount spent on candy ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5) to find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought: $2 / $1.5 = 1.33 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.33}$"
"To find the age of Carver's son, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S.

We know that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45. We also know that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, which can be written as:

C = 2S - 5

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get:

45 = 2S - 5

Adding 5 to both sides of the equation, we get:

50 = 2S

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:

S = 25

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total distance traveled by the train in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance).

The total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval:

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days

To convert 0.0375 days to hours, we multiply by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):

0.0375 days * 24 hours/day = 0.9 hours

To convert 0.9 hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

0.9 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 54 minutes

The train goes between services for approximately 54 minutes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing needed, we need to calculate the amount of stuffing required for each type of bed and then add them together.

A Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. Since a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between the first two kinds of beds, we can calculate it as follows:

Average = (Rottweiler bed + Chihuahua bed) / 2
Average = (8 + 2) / 2
Average = 10 / 2
Average = 5 pounds

So, a collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing.

To make 4 chihuahua beds, Mark needs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.

To make 3 collie beds, Mark needs 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles and the speed is 70 mph. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Time = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours

Next, we need to add the time taken for the detour. The detour is 10 miles and the speed remains 70 mph. We can use the same formula:

Time = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.14 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken to drive back home. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph. Again, we use the same formula:

Time = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Finally, we add the times together to get the total time taken:

Total time taken = 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours + 3 hours = 5.99 hours

The final answer is: 5.99"
"To determine the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we can use a simple subtraction method. 

First, we need to find the total number of students who were absent. We know that 5 girls and 4 boys were absent. 

Total absent students = 5 girls + 4 boys = 9

Now, we subtract the total absent students from the total number of students to find the number of boys present.

Number of boys present = Total students - Total absent students
= 96 - 9
= 87

Therefore, there were 87 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday."
"To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to determine the number of boys first. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can calculate the number of boys by dividing the number of girls by 2.

Number of boys = Number of girls / 2
Number of boys = 6 / 2
Number of boys = 3

Now, we add the number of boys and girls to find the total number of kids in the park.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 3 + 6
Total number of kids = 9

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. We can represent this as a variable, let's call it x. Then, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is 4x - 5. Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we can set up the equation 4x - 5 = 7 (since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting).

Solving for x, we get:
4x - 5 = 7
4x = 7 + 5
4x = 12
x = 12/4
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting: 4x - 5 = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.

We also know that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So, the number of customers kicked out for physical violence is 3(7) = 21.

The total number of customers kicked out is the sum of the customers kicked out for each reason: 3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31.

Since a total of 50 people were kicked out, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 31 = 19.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Sara had x points before. Then, Erin had 3x points.

We know that Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 14

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 14 / 3
x = 4.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a point, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can express the exact value of x as a fraction.

x = 14 / 3

Now, to find out how many points Erin had before, we can multiply Sara's points by 3:

Erin's points before = 3x
Erin's points before = 3 * (14 / 3)
Erin's points before = 14

The correct answer is 14."
"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break it down into parts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and an additional 20% of that cost is needed for the logo. 20% of $20 is $4, so the total cost per frame is $20 + $4 = $24. Since there are 44 frames, the total cost for the frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins, each costing $5. So, the total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 seniors. Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we add the costs of the frames, pins, and cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To calculate the cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to find 20% of the original cost and subtract it from the original cost.

Original cost = $400
Discount = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80

Total cost for DIY = Original cost - Discount
= $400 - $80
= $320

The total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

The store sold 14 pairs of shoes on Friday. On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, 6 people returned their shoes, so we need to subtract those from the total.

Total number of shoes sold = 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returned) = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total hours of dance practice per week, we need to calculate the hours for each day and add them together.

Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class. This means Saturday's practice is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Total hours per week = Tuesday hours + Thursday hours + Saturday hours
= 1 + 2 + 2
= 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Let's say the total number of pieces is x. Since 40% of the equipment were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The number of functioning pieces is x - 0.4x = 0.6x.

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is the total amount spent on all pieces minus the amount spent on faulty pieces. The total amount spent on all pieces is $400,000.

The amount spent on faulty pieces is 0.4x.

So, the amount spent on functioning pieces is 400,000 - 0.4x.

Since we know that 0.6x represents the number of functioning pieces, we can set up the equation:

0.6x = 400,000 - 0.4x

Combine like terms:

0.6x + 0.4x = 400,000

1x = 400,000

x = 400,000

Now that we know the total number of pieces is 400,000, we can find the number of functioning pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = 0.6x
= 0.6 * 400,000
= 240,000

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 400,000 - 0.4 * 400,000
= 400,000 - 160,000
= 240,000

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep.

Since Mary gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep and 2 kg of milk from the other half, we can calculate the total milk as follows:

Total milk = (1 kg * 15 sheep) + (2 kg * 15 sheep)
Total milk = 15 kg + 30 kg
Total milk = 45 kg

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"To find the number of rolls Mrs. Sherman had left after feeding her children, we subtract 6 from 12 (since she fed 6 children one each).

12 - 6 = 6

Then, she broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply 6 by 8.

6 * 8 = 48

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

Final answer: 48"
"To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we can break down the problem into steps:

First, we need to find the number of pupils who like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we can calculate this as:

Number of pupils who like blue = Total number of pupils / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Next, we need to find the number of pupils who like green. Since one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, we can calculate this as:

Number of pupils who like green = (Total number of pupils - Number of pupils who like blue) / 4
= (40 - 20) / 4
= 20 / 4
= 5

Finally, we can find the number of pupils who like yellow by subtracting the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:

Number of pupils who like yellow = Total number of pupils - (Number of pupils who like blue + Number of pupils who like green)
= 40 - (20 + 5)
= 40 - 25
= 15

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow."
"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to first determine how many apples Lucy picked on Monday. Since she sold all the apples picked on Monday and she got $56, we can divide $56 by $4 to find out how many apples she picked on Monday.

Let's calculate the number of apples picked on Monday: 56 รท 4 = 14 apples

Since Lucy picked double the number of apples on Wednesday compared to Tuesday, and she picked 12 apples on Tuesday, we can calculate the number of apples picked on Wednesday as 12 * 2 = 24 apples.

Now, we can add the number of apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday to find the total number of apples picked.

14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

The total number of apples picked is 50."
"To find the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed and subtract that from the total number of socks.

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair has 2 socks, she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

She also washed 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

Therefore, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies she initially had, the number of cookies Janet gave her, and the number of cookies her brother ate.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initial cookies: 23
2. Cookies from Janet: +42 (since Janet gave her cookies, we add)
3. Cookies eaten by brother: -44 (since her brother ate cookies, we subtract)

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies left:

Initial cookies + cookies from Janet - cookies eaten by brother
= 23 + 42 - 44
= 21

So, Rachel has 21 cookies left.

Final answer: 21"
"To calculate Karan's monthly payment, we need to find the interest first. The interest is 10% of the principal amount of $3,650. 

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we add the interest to the principal to get the total amount:
Total amount = Principal + Interest
Total amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5:
Monthly payment = Total amount / 5
Monthly payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly payment = $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"
"To find the difference in distance hiked between Cho and Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each of them covered.

Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. We can find the distance covered by Cho using the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 14 km/h x 8 h
Distance = 112 km

Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. We can find the distance covered by Chloe using the same formula:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 9 km/h x 5 h
Distance = 45 km

Now, we need to find the difference between the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:

Difference = Distance hiked by Cho - Distance hiked by Chloe
Difference = 112 km - 45 km
Difference = 67 km

The final answer is: $\boxed{67}$"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To calculate Millie's profit per hour, we need to first find her total revenue and total cost.

Her total revenue is the number of cups of lemonade she sells multiplied by the price per cup. Since she sells 4 cups per hour and she sells all 36 cups, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Her total cost is the amount she spends on supplies, which is $18.

Her profit is her total revenue minus her total cost: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells all the lemonade in 9 hours, her profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation: (2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26. Since the choir is performing with just the female members, there are 26 girls.

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find half of the total number of people performing. The total number of people performing is the number of girls (26) plus the 3 teachers, which is 26 + 3 = 29. Half of 29 is 29 / 2 = 14.5. Since we can't have half a person, we'll round down to 14.

So, the total number of people performing is 26 (girls) + 3 (teachers) - 14 (half of the performers) = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To calculate Wilson's current math grade, we need to find the average of his 5 test scores. The average is calculated by adding up all the scores and dividing by the number of tests.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Let x be the number of messages James delivers to Ms. Thompson. Then, the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu is 1/3x.

We know that James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson, so we can set up the equation:

x = 66

Now, we can find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu:

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3x
= 1/3(66)
= 22

Total number of messages = x + 1/3x
= 66 + 22
= 88

The final answer is 88."
"To determine how much David saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 9 ride tickets to the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

A ride bracelet costs $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. Therefore, he saves $30 - $18 = $12.

However, let's consider the scenario from Dasha's perspective. If Dasha buys 9 ride tickets, the cost is $18. If she buys a ride bracelet, the cost is $30.

In this case, Dasha actually spends more money when buying a ride bracelet. 

The final answer is 12."
"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon she has by the number of gifts she wants to make bows for.

Total gifts = 6 (for family) + 4 (for friends) + 2 (for teachers) = 12 gifts
Total ribbon = 144 inches

Ribbon per gift = Total ribbon / Total gifts
Ribbon per gift = 144 / 12
Ribbon per gift = 12 inches

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To find the number of popsicles each person has, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. 

Let's represent the number of popsicles Betty has as 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has as 6x, where x is a common multiplier. We know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. So, we can set up the equation:

5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms:
11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 15

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
Betty: 5x = 5(15) = 75
Sam: 6x = 6(15) = 90

To find the difference, subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To calculate the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to find the difference between the cost of the cable package and the cost of the streaming services.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling. 20% of $10 is $2, so the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.

To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42

Tim saves $42 per month by cancelling his cable package.

The final answer is: $42"
"To find the total work time, we need to convert the time spent recording from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 90 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

Time spent recording = 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours

Now, we can find the total work time by adding the time spent writing, recording, and editing:

Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
= 4 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours
= 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we can divide the time spent editing by the total work time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
= (1.5 hours / 7 hours) * 100
= 21.43%

"To determine how many days Mark needs to save for the bike, we can use a simple division problem. 

Mark has $50 initially and wants to buy a bike that costs $300. To find out how much more he needs to save, we subtract the initial amount from the cost of the bike:

$300 (cost of the bike) - $50 (initial amount) = $250 (remaining amount)

Since Mark earns $10 per day, we can divide the remaining amount by his daily earnings to find the number of days he needs to save:

$250 รท $10 = 25 days

Therefore, Mark needs 25 days to save enough money to buy the bike.

"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we need to calculate the difference between the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply these amounts by 4.

Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide the total amount of each by 2 to find the number of bags and bottles needed, respectively.

Flour bags: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags
Milk bottles: 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles

To find the difference, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4

"To find the energy saved, we need to calculate the difference in energy usage between 8 hours and 3 hours of air conditioner usage per day.

First, let's find the energy used in 8 hours a day: 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh). Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 Wh, we can convert this to kilowatts:

Energy used in 8 hours a day = 7200 Wh / 1000 = 7.2 kWh

Now, let's find the energy used in 3 hours a day: 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh, which is equal to 2.7 kWh.

The energy saved per day is the difference between these two values: 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To find the energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30: 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

The second package costs twice as much, so it costs 2 x $400 = $800.
The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 x $1200 = $240.
The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we can divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12.

She eats 2 cookies per night for 30 days, so the total number of cookies she needs is 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

To find out how many dozens she needs, we can divide 60 by 12:

60 รท 12 = 5

Since 5 is the result, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

Final answer: 5"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the intersection of the two sets. 

First, let's find 5% of 50,000 candles, which represents the number of candles with the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. This can be calculated as:

0.05 x 50,000 = 2,500 candles

Since these candles are also more dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog, we can assume that all 2,500 candles with the defect will explode.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 2,500.

Final answer: 2500"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to calculate the discount amount and then multiply it by the number of blouses.

The discount is 30% of the regular price of $20. 
Discount = 0.3 * $20 = $6

The discounted price of each blouse is the regular price minus the discount amount.
Discounted price = $20 - $6 = $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
Total cost = 4 * $14 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as x. Since her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, her sister gathers 2x apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is x + 2x + 15 + 45 = 3x + 60.

Since the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, we can set up the equation:

3x + 60 = 500 - y

We also know that the total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 3x + 60. Since the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - (3x + 60).

Now we can rewrite the equation as 3x + 60 = 500 - (500 - (3x + 60)).

Simplifying the equation, we get 3x + 60 = 3x + 60.

This equation is true for any value of x, which means that the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 0.

The final answer is 0."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.

We know that camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump. The total number of bumps (humps) is 304, so we can set up the equation:

2c + d = 304

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, since each animal has one head. Therefore, we can set up another equation:

c + d = 180

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously. We can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting 'c' into one of the original equations:

c + d = 180
124 + d = 180
d = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 km is:
0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

So, the total distance traveled in the first 6 days is:
800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we add the distances traveled in the first 6 days and the second week:
1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers."
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Peter's locker size by 4 to get Zack's locker size.

Peter's locker size = 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches

Since Timothy's locker is half as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2 to get Timothy's locker size.

Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the distance Oliver must climb, we need to calculate the difference in elevation between Stanley's comb and Oliver's current elevation.

The elevation of Stanley's comb is 10,000 feet, and Oliver is at 3,000 feet. 

10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 feet

Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial amount he had to the amount he received from the two banks.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initial capital: $5000
2. Amount received from the first bank: $4000
3. Amount received from the second bank: 2 * $4000 = $8000
4. Total amount received: $4000 + $8000 = $12000
5. Now, let's add the initial capital to the total amount received: $5000 + $12000 = $17000

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

First, we'll calculate the number of cats carried away by the boats. Since 4 boats carried away 5 cats each, the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

Next, we'll find the number of remaining cats on the rock. We subtract the cats carried away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

Then, we'll calculate 3/5 of the remaining cats that ran after a mouse. To do this, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

Finally, we'll subtract the cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The final answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory deal, the normal rate, and the increased rate.

The first 6 months were $8 per month, so the total cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months were at the normal rate of $12 per month, so the total cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.

The last 8 months were at the increased rate of $14 per month, so the total cost for this period is 8 * $14 = $112.

Now, let's add up the costs: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256.

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $256."
"To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we need to first find the total amount Cole saved. Since he saved a total of $6 and 1/3 of it came from the jogger jeans, 2/3 of the total savings came from the tattered jeans.

Let's assume the original price of the jogger jeans is x. Then, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, the amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * x.

The amount saved from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * (x + 6).

We know that the total savings is $6, so we can set up the equation:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * (x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

(1/3)x + (2/3)x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

(3/3)x + (2/3)x + 4 = 6

This simplifies to:

(5/3)x + 4 = 6

Subtract 4 from both sides:

(5/3)x = 2

Multiply both sides by 3/5:

x = 6/5

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $6/5, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

Original price of tattered jeans = x + 6
= 6/5 + 6
= 36/5

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:
$36/5 - $6
= 6/5

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.2}$"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each vehicle and add them together.

There are 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each, so the total capacity of the buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.

There are 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each, so the total capacity of the minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.

There are 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each, so the total capacity of the minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and Lillian buys 3 of them. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 x 20 = 60.

The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. She builds 3 of these feeders, so the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 x 30 = 90.

Now, we add the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

Final answer: $\boxed{150}$"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item.

The bagel costs $4. Since the soup costs 25% more than the bagel, we can calculate its cost by adding 25% of $4 to the original price. This can be expressed as:

Cost of soup = Cost of bagel + (25% of Cost of bagel)
= $4 + (0.25 * $4)
= $4 + $1
= $5

The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, so the cake costs:

Cost of cake = Cost of bagel / 2
= $4 / 2
= $2

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

Total cost = Cost of bagel + Cost of soup + Cost of cake
= $4 + $5 + $2
= $11

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine the total amount of money he made from selling the cards and then use that information to calculate the initial number of cards.

Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash, he must have made $50 from selling the cards. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Let x be the total number of cards Kenny started with. The number of cards he sells is x - 1/3. Since he sells each card for $1.5, the amount of money he made from selling the cards is 1.5(x - 1/3).

We know that the amount of money he made from selling the cards is $50. So we can set up the equation:

1.5(x - 1/3) = 50

To solve for x, we need to first simplify the equation:

1.5x - 0.5 = 50

Now, add 0.5 to both sides:

1.5x = 50.5

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 50.5 / 1.5
x = 33.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we round down to the nearest whole number.

x = 33

Therefore, Kenny started with 33 cards."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many guests were initially prepared for two hotdogs. Since half of the guests were prepared for two hotdogs, we can calculate this as follows:

36 guests / 2 = 18 guests were prepared for two hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that the caterer had enough hotdogs for 40 guests to have two hotdogs. Since 18 guests were prepared for two hotdogs, the remaining guests who only had one hotdog are:

40 guests - 18 guests = 22 guests

So, 22 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To find the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we need to calculate the number of letters in each name and then add them together.

Indras' name has 6 letters. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. Half of 6 is 3, and adding 4 to that gives us 7 letters in her sister's name.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7). 

6 + 7 = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to find 20% of the total cost and subtract it from the total.

First, let's find the total cost of the items:
Pot and pans: $120.00
Mixing bowls: $20.00
Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, let's calculate 20% of the total cost:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To determine how much more money Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and subtract the amount she already has.

The total cost of the items is $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost:

$19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

Final Answer: The final answer is $1."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Then, Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. This can be represented as 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Next, Prince Walter, using a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Finally, Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter using a nail file. This can be calculated as 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons.

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can multiply 15 gallons by 8 pints/gallon to get the total number of pints.

15 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 120 pints

Then, we need to find 1/4 of 120 pints.

1/4 of 120 pints = 120 * 1/4 = 30 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that George spent $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. Since he had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of his money, which is 500 - (500 x 1%) = 500 - 5 = 495 cents.

Next, we subtract the cost of chips (3 x 40 cents = 120 cents) from the total amount he spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars: 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many he bought: 375 / 75 = 5.

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

Total lollipops = 25
Lollipops kept by Ray = 5
Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5 = 20

Since the remaining lollipops were shared equally among 4 friends, we divide the remaining lollipops by 4.

Lollipops per friend = 20 รท 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"

The cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00.
The cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00.
The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2."
"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we need to calculate the time it takes for her to get to the theater and compare it to Wayne's travel time.

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 x 4 = 16 minutes.

If Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne.

Final answer: $\boxed{21}$"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width. We know the area is 360 square feet, so we can set up the equation:

360 = 9 * Width

To find the width, we can divide both sides by 9:

Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of the room is 98 feet."

"To calculate the total cost of the hay, we need to first find out how much hay the horse eats in 30 minutes. 

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

Time (in hours) = 30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, and it runs for 16 miles (32 MPH * 0.5 hours), the total amount of hay eaten is:

Hay eaten = 16 miles * 1/2 bail per mile = 8 bails

A bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:

Cost of hay = 8 bails * $3 per bail = $24

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30. To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money Michael has:

Change = $30 - $24

"To find the regular price of the popcorn, let's analyze the situation:

You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, which costs $20. This means the cost of the movie ticket and popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $20 - $2 = $18.

The super ticket includes one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. So, the cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $18 - $1 = $17.

The cost of the movie ticket is $12. To find the cost of the popcorn, we subtract the cost of the movie ticket from the cost without the super ticket: $17 - $12 = $5.

The cost of the soda is $3. However, we are only asked for the cost of the popcorn. Therefore, the regular price of the popcorn is $5."
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the new cost of filling 20 balloons. The original cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. After the price increase, the cost of filling each balloon was $20 more. So, the new cost of filling each balloon is $900 / 20 + $20 = $55.

$55 * 170 = $9350.

The final answer is $9350."
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then, it travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, covering a distance of 30 * 1 = 30 miles. The total distance traveled is 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, but she trades 3 sapphires. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

She received 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find the total number of apples eaten, we can multiply the number of apples each person eats per day by the number of days.

Since Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day, we can multiply 4 apples/day by 2 people (Marin and Nancy) to get the total number of apples eaten per day: 4 apples/day * 2 people = 8 apples/day.

To find the total number of apples eaten in 30 days, we can multiply the total number of apples eaten per day by 30: 8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples.

Therefore, Marin and Nancy will eat a total of 240 apples in 30 days."
"To calculate the total cost of potting soil, we need to find the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. 

The volume of one bed is length x width x height = 8 x 2 x 2 = 32 cubic feet.

"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to calculate the total number of puppies and the number of puppies with spots.

First, we add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has (8) to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has (12).

8 + 12 = 20

Next, we add the number of puppies with spots from both dogs. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.

3 + 4 = 7

Now, we divide the number of puppies with spots (7) by the total number of puppies (20) and multiply by 100 to find the percentage.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To calculate the total weight of the feed, we need to add up the weight of each item.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, which weigh 2 pounds each. He buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds. He also buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, and 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds.

Total weight of feed = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 42 * 75 pounds (hay) + 20 * 65 pounds (oats)
= 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300
= 4400 pounds

To find the number of trips the farmer needs to make, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck, which is 2250 pounds.

Number of trips = Total weight / Capacity of the truck
= 4400 / 2250
= 1.96

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic manipulation to isolate the variable x, which represents the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat.

Let's set up the equation based on the given information: Matt gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be represented as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we'll first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term involving x:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we need to calculate the combined length of the remoras and divide it by the length of the shark.

The length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 feet (since 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet). So, the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy by dividing the combined length of the remoras (1 foot) by the length of the shark (10 feet) and multiplying by 100.

(1 / 10) * 100 = 10%

So, the remoras occupy 10% of the shark's body length.

"To find the total number of students, we can set up an equation. Let's say the total number of students is x.

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x.

We know that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, so the number of students without a desktop computer is x - (3/4)x = (1/4)x.

We can set up the equation (1/4)x = 20 and solve for x. To do this, we can multiply both sides by 4:

(1/4)x * 4 = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level."
"To determine how long Jason needs to walk each day to break in his new shoes, we can divide the total number of minutes (240) by the total number of days (21).

240 minutes รท 21 days = 11.43 minutes per day

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, we can also calculate the daily time by dividing the total time by the number of days walked per week.

240 minutes รท 4 days/week = 60 minutes per week

Now, we can divide the weekly time by 7 days to find the daily time.

60 minutes/week รท 7 days/week = 8.57 minutes per day

However, we can also calculate the daily time by dividing the total time by the number of days walked per week and then dividing by 7.

"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to find the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's break it down step by step.

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost), where x is the number of guests. The cost of the second venue is $25x (per guest charge). Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the number of insects each person found.

Let's say Bodhi found x insects. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

So, Lily found 16 insects.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma. 

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, which is equivalent to 91 yards (since 1/4 * 364 = 91). Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is equivalent to 182 yards (since 1/2 * 364 = 182).

Total yards used = 91 + 182 = 273 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{273}$"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the gifts for each group of friends and add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts for the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of friends (2) by the number of gifts each friend wants (5), which gives us 2 x 5 = 10.

Next, we calculate the total number of gifts for the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of friends (3) by the number of gifts each friend wants (2), which gives us 3 x 2 = 6.

Now, we add the gifts for both groups together: 10 + 6 = 16.

Finally, Cherrie decides to get 10 more random gifts. So, we add these to the previous total: 16 + 10 = 26.

Therefore, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the length of the couch, we need to first find the width of the rug. Since the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 x 8 = 16 feet. The couch is 2 feet longer than that, so the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we need to first determine the total amount Suzie spent on the grape and green apple gum. Since she paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half as much for a pack of green apple gum, she spent $2 for the green apple gum.

The total amount spent on grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie spent a total of $7, the amount spent on strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we divide the total amount spent on strawberry gum by the number of packs, which is 2. So, the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $4 รท 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the most cost-effective option for Frederick, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber.

The cost per stick for 2 x 4 lumber is $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick. This is equivalent to $0.02.

The cost per stick for 2 x 8 lumber is $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick. This is less than $0.02, making it the more cost-effective option.

Since Frederick has $24 to spend, we can calculate the maximum number of 2 x 8 lumber he can buy: $24 / $6 = 4. This means he can buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 lumber.

The total number of sticks he can make is 4 x 400 = 1600 sticks.

The final answer is: 1600"
"To calculate the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's 6 sled dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by the cost of each pair of snowshoes.

The cost per pair of snowshoes is $12.00. Since each dog needs a pair, we can multiply the number of dogs by the cost per pair:

Total cost = Number of dogs * Cost per pair of snowshoes
Total cost = 6 * $12.00
Total cost = $72.00

Therefore, Mario will need to spend $72.00 to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs."
"To calculate the weekly cost of Janet's bus trips, we need to multiply the number of trips she takes per day by the cost per trip and then multiply that result by the number of days she takes the bus in a week.

Janet takes 2 bus trips per day, 5 days a week. The cost per trip is $2.20. 

First, we multiply the number of trips per day by the cost per trip: 2 trips/day * $2.20/trip = $4.40/day

Next, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days she takes the bus in a week: $4.40/day * 5 days/week = $22.00/week

If Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total number of animals in the farm and zoo, we need to calculate the number of cows and sheep in each location and then add them together.

First, we know the farm has 30 cows. Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

Next, we know the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of animals in the farm and zoo by adding the number of cows and sheep from both places.

Total animals = 30 (cows from the farm) + 60 (cows from the zoo) + 10 (sheep from the farm) + 20 (sheep from the zoo) = 120

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to divide the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought by 4.

"To calculate the calorie deficit needed for Andy to lose 30 pounds, we need to determine the total number of days he has to achieve this goal. 

Since Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st, we can count the days from December 31st to July 19th. 

December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming a non-leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days. 

So, the total number of days is 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 212 days.

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to create a calorie deficit of 3500 calories per day for 212 days. 

To find the total calorie deficit, we multiply the number of calories burned per day by the number of days: 3500 * 212 = 738,000 calories.

Now, to find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 738,000 / 212 โ 3485 calories per day.

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 3485 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday."

"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes:
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4 since the house costs three times as much as the lot.

Let's set up the equation:

House cost + Lot cost = Total cost
3x + x = 120,000
4x = 120,000

Now, divide both sides by 4:
x = 120,000 / 4
x = 30,000

So, the house cost $30,000."
"To find the profit earned by Tara, we need to calculate the difference between the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total cost of the bags. Since Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each, we can multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:

Total Cost = Number of packs * Cost per pack
Total Cost = 8 * $4
Total Cost = $32

Next, we need to find the total revenue. Tara sold the bags at a price of $8 each. Since she sold 8 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the selling price per bag:

Total Revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total Revenue = 8 * $8
Total Revenue = $64

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $64 - $32
Profit = $32

"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of cookies Suzanne made as S, Josh's cookies as J, and Kelsie's cookies as K.

We know that Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, so we can write an equation:

J = S/4

We also know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so we can write another equation:

K = 2J

We are given that Suzanne made 36 cookies, so we can substitute S = 36 into the first equation:

J = 36/4
J = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find Kelsie's cookies by substituting J into the second equation:

K = 2J
K = 2(9)
K = 18

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total amount of money Ali has, we need to add the amount of money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills.

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 x $10 = $40. 
Ali has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 x $20 = $120. 
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 
The remaining amount of money Ali has is $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. 
3/5 of $80 is (3/5) x $80 = $48. 
The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to represent the number of chairs Ophelia has. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Ophelia has is x - 2.

We are given that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so the number of chairs Jenna has is 3x.

We know Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation: x - 2 = 20.

Solving for x, we get x = 22.

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has: 3x = 3 * 22 = 66.

The total number of sofas and chairs is 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 108.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

Next, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

Finally, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which is 3 times the number who got off (21), so 3 * 21 = 63. So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 + 63 = 122.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James' cousin. 

Let's denote James' current age as J and his cousin's current age as C. We know that James will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is J = 27 - 5 = 22 years.

In 8 years, James' cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James' age. This can be expressed as C + 8 = 2J - 5.

Substituting J = 22 into the equation, we get C + 8 = 2(22) - 5.
C + 8 = 44 - 5
C + 8 = 39
C = 39 - 8
C = 31

Now that we know James' cousin's current age, we can find the age difference between James and his cousin: 31 - 22 = 9 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

Since the total cost of all three items is $2,400, the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2: $600 รท 2 = $300.

"To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we need to first determine the total number of seashells brought by the girls. 

Since the boys brought 60 shells each and there are 20 kids in total, the number of boys is half of 20, which is 10. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 
So, the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

Now, we need to divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls. 
There are 10 girls, so each girl brought 300 / 10 = 30 seashells.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of candies Nick had initially as 'N' and the number of candies George had initially as 'G'. We know that Nick had twice as many candies as George, so we can write an equation:

N = 2G

We also know that George ate 5 candies and had 3 left, so we can write another equation:

G = 3 + 5
G = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of candies Nick had:

N = 2G
N = 2(8)
N = 16

Therefore, Nick had 16 candies initially.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine Anne's age, we can follow a straightforward approach by analyzing the given information:

We know that Chenny is 10 years old, and Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny. This means Alyana's age can be calculated as:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Next, we are told that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. To find Anne's age, we add 2 to Alyana's age:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making his total $6 + $5 = $11.

The next day, he adds another $10 to his total, making it $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He saves some more money and triples the amount he had left after spending $8. This means he now has 3 times the amount he had after spending $8, which is 3 * $13 = $39.

Therefore, the eldest boy now has $39."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts. Let's start by finding out how much Elvis saves in the first half of the month. Since there are 30 days in April, the first half would be 15 days. 

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half as 'x'. Then, the total savings for the first half would be 15x. 

We know that Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, so the amount he saves each day in the second half would be 2x. Since there are 15 days in the second half, the total savings for the second half would be 15(2x) = 30x.

The total savings for the month is $1125, so we can set up the equation:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine like terms:

45x = 1125

Divide both sides by 45:

x = 25

So Elvis saves $25 per day in the first half of the month.

Since the second half is twice as much, Elvis saves 2x = 2 * 25 = $50 per day in the second half of the month.

Final answer: $50"

The cost of peaches: 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Total cost: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is: $20 - $13.00 = $7.00"
"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to calculate their earnings.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he earns 20 x $0.8 = $16.
Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she earns 20 x $0.5 = $10.

The difference between their earnings is $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4x dollars, Jeff gets 4(20) = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work. 

Distance to work = 3 miles
Distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Number of days worked per week = 5

Total miles walked per week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we can break down the process into three steps:

1. Elise writes the alphabet twice: This means she writes 26 letters twice, which equals 26 * 2 = 52 letters.
2. She writes half of the alphabet once: Since the alphabet has 26 letters, half of it would be 26 / 2 = 13 letters.
3. She re-writes everything she has already written: This means she re-writes the 52 letters from step 1 and the 13 letters from step 2, resulting in a total of 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is 65.

Final answer: $\boxed{65}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have a phone tree where Ali calls 3 families in the first round. Then, each family calls 3 other families in the second round, and so on. We need to find the total number of families notified in the fourth round.

In the first round, 3 families are notified.

In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 x 3 = 9 families are notified.

In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 x 3 = 27 families are notified.

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 x 3 = 81 families are notified.

To find the total number of families notified, we add the number of families notified in each round: 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to add the weight he lost to his final weight. Since Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, we can calculate his initial weight as follows:

Initial weight = Final weight + (Weight lost per month * Number of months)
Initial weight = 70 + (10 * 3)
Initial weight = 70 + 30
Initial weight = 100

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"To determine the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to find the number of toys he needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys.

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 402 toys."
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks = 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 2 pens = 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator = $12
The cost of 1 geometry set = $10

Total cost of all items = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Now, we need to apply the 10% discount. 
10% of $30 = 0.1 * $30 = $3
Discount amount = $3
Total cost after discount = $30 - $3 = $27

The final answer is: $27"
"To calculate the total cost of Carly's order, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its respective price and add them together.

The cost of hamburgers: 5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20
The cost of potato fries: 10 packs * $0.30 each pack = $3
The cost of fruit drinks: 5 cans * $2 each can = $10

The total cost of the items: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

Since Carly pays with a $50 bill, we can find the change by subtracting the total cost from the $50 bill:
$50 - $33 = $17

Therefore, Carly gets $17 in change.

17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000.

Commission for sales up to $1000: 
30% of $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300

Additional commission for sales over $1000: 
10% of $1500 (since $2500 - $1000 = $1500) = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

Total commission earned by Antonella = $300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required for his guests and subtract the number of bottles he already has.

Bill has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so he has a total of 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

Since Bill wants 2 bottles of water for each guest, and he has 70 guests, he will need 70 x 2 = 140 bottles.

To find out how many more bottles he needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{92}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day and then subtract the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a cold day.

First, we find the time it takes Ray to swim 1 mile on a hot day. We know that he swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. So, we first find the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a cold day:
2 x 16 = 32
32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3:
3 x 34 = 102 minutes

To find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day, we can also multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a cold day by 3:
3 x 16 = 48 minutes

Now, we subtract the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a cold day from the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day:
102 - 48 = 54 minutes

The time difference between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day is 54 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To calculate how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to first find out how much he earns in a week. He gets paid $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. 

Weekly earnings = $2/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, let's divide the amount he wants to save ($80) by his weekly earnings ($40):

$80 รท $40 = 2 weeks

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

Let's break it down:

- Number of buttons with two holes: 7
- Number of holes in each button with two holes: 2
- Total number of holes in buttons with two holes: 7 x 2 = 14

- Number of buttons with four holes: 21 - 7 = 14
- Number of holes in each button with four holes: 4
- Total number of holes in buttons with four holes: 14 x 4 = 56

Now, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons: 14 + 56 = 70.

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70."
"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first determine the size of Zack's locker, which is half the size of Timothy's locker. Since Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we can calculate Zack's locker size by dividing 24 by 2.

Zack's locker size = 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Next, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find the size of Peter's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size = (1/4) ร 12 = 3 cubic inches

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many cups Juan drinks, we need to multiply the amount Octavia drinks by 10. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, she drinks 0.5 cups. 

Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 0.5 * 10 = 5 cups.

The doctor has asked Juan to reduce his intake to 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract 4 from 5.

5 - 4 = 1

Juan needs to reduce his daily coffee intake by 1 cup.

"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs.

Let's calculate the total number of rodents:

Number of hamsters: 3 cages * 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters
Number of guinea pigs: 3 cages * 5 guinea pigs per cage = 15 guinea pigs

Total number of rodents = 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs
Total number of rodents = 30 + 15
Total number of rodents = 45

The pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we need to add their weights and divide by 3.

Mark's weight is 150 pounds, and Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. Since Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, his weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the 3 friends is 180 pounds."
"To find the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to calculate the total angle the sun has moved upward. Since the sun moves 5 degrees per hour, we can multiply the number of hours by the rate of movement to find the total angle moved.

Angle moved = rate * time
Angle moved = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours
Angle moved = 50 degrees

The initial angle of the sun from the ground is 32 degrees. To find the final angle, we add the angle moved to the initial angle.

Final angle = initial angle + angle moved
Final angle = 32 degrees + 50 degrees
Final angle = 82 degrees

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

Final answer: 82"
"To determine the total cost of the birthday candles, we need to calculate the number of candles needed and then multiply it by the cost per pack.

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. However, the age of the sons is not directly relevant to calculating the cost of the candles.

We know that James needs 2 sons' worth of candles, and each pack contains 5 candles. To find the total number of packs needed, we divide the total number of candles required by the number of candles per pack: 2 * 5 = 10 candles. Since 10 candles cannot be divided into packs of 5, James will need to buy 2 packs of candles.

The cost of each pack is $3. Therefore, the total cost will be 2 packs * $3 per pack = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of pages she read in each week and then add them together.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night, which is equivalent to 15 * 7 = 105 minutes. Since she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes by dividing 105 by 1.5.

105 รท 1.5 = 70 pages

So, in the first week, Judy read 70 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find out how many pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first and second week.

70 + 100 = 170 pages

The final answer is: $\boxed{170}$"
"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor.

Cody ate 1/3 of the sandwiches, which is (1/3) ร 12 = 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate 1/4 of the sandwiches, which is (1/4) ร 12 = 3 sandwiches.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches.
12 - 7 = 5

There are 5 sandwiches left.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be S + 7 years old, and his nephew will be N + 7 years old. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be represented by the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

The final answer is: 10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break it down step by step.

The tooth fairy initially left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. Then, for the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, totaling $3.00. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth, which is $0.50 per tooth. So, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can use the given information. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M and the number of goals scored by Anna as A.

We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can write an equation: 
Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20
80 = M + 20

Solving for M, we get:
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can write another equation:
Richie's goals = Anna's goals + 45
80 = A + 45

Solving for A, we get:
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam, we need to calculate the difference between the total amount Mitchell made and the amount Liam made.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so his total earnings can be calculated as:

21 * 4 = $84

Liam made $63. To find the difference, we subtract his earnings from Mitchell's earnings:

$84 - $63 = $21

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam.

The final answer is $21."
"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

Peter spent $5 each day from Sunday to Wednesday, so he spent a total of $5 * 3 = $15 on wooden action figures. He had $70 initially, so he has $70 - $15 = $55 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $55 left, so he can buy $55 / $2 = 27.5 plastic action figures. Since he can't buy half a figure, he will buy 27 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 3 wooden action figures and 27 plastic action figures. To find the total number of action figures, we add these amounts together: 3 + 27 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To calculate the total cost of the kitten, we need to add the costs of spaying, vaccines, and broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200. The cost of the vaccines is 3 vaccines * $20 each, which equals $60. The cost of the broken vases is 4 vases * $12 each, which equals $48.

Total cost = $308

The kitten has cost $308 so far."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses needed and compare it to the number of roses he grows.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses he grows per week by 4 to find the total roses he grows in a month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. To find the total number of roses needed per week, we add the number of roses ordered by each shop:
20 roses + 15 roses + 30 roses = 65 roses/week

Since we already calculated the total roses needed per month, we can multiply the total roses needed per week by 4 to find the total roses needed per month:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, we subtract the number of roses Ford grows in a month from the total number of roses needed per month to find out how many roses he lacks:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in 2 years.

Since she removes $100 every month, the total amount removed in 2 years (24 months) is:
$100 * 24 = $2400

Now, subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:
$3000 - $2400 = $600

The remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years is $600."
"To calculate the net profit of the food truck, we need to determine the total revenue and total cost.

The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. The total revenue can be calculated as:

Total Revenue = Number of Sandwiches * Price per Sandwich
Total Revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total Revenue = $70.00

The food truck spends $3.00 per loaf of bread, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Since they sold 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread. The cost of bread is:

Cost of Bread = Number of Loaves * Cost per Loaf
Cost of Bread = 1 * $3.00
Cost of Bread = $3.00

Additionally, they spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches. The total cost is:

Total Cost = Cost of Bread + Cost of Cheese and Condiments
Total Cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total Cost = $33.00

The net profit is the difference between the total revenue and total cost:

Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Net Profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net Profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To determine the total number of muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to calculate the total number of crayons she has. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box.

Total crayons = 3 * 64
Total crayons = 192

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together, we divide the total number of crayons by 8.

Number of muffin crayons = Total crayons / 8
Number of muffin crayons = 192 / 8
Number of muffin crayons = 24

To find out how much money Kate can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin.

Total money = Number of muffin crayons * $1.50
Total money = 24 * $1.50

"To calculate the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to consider the cost of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation.

First, let's calculate the area of the room: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of removal is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is 216 square feet * $4 per square foot = $864.

The cost of installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $10512.

"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The oven is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees off. 
To find the percentage, we divide the difference by the original temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find 4% of 520. 
4% of 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

First, we convert both times to minutes:
1 hour and 30 minutes = 90 minutes
2 hours and 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the two times:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

The total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value is $76,000. To find 30% of this value, we multiply $76,000 by 0.3.

0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800

Now, we subtract $22,800 from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value.

$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

The value of Juan's house is $53,200. To find the combined value of both houses, we add their values.

$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. To find the discounted price, we need to calculate 10% of $100.00 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $100.00 is 0.10 x $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 x $90.00 = $180.00

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes will contain 2 x 90 = 180 pairs.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs:

Cost per pair = $180.00 รท 180 pairs
= $1.00 per pair

"To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. Since she earns $10 per hour, her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. Since he also earns $10 per hour, his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to determine the total calories she burns from her activities.

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.

Additionally, she runs for 1 hour, burning 600 calories. Therefore, the total calories burned from running is 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find the number of 200-calorie units: 1600 / 200 = 8 units.

Each unit requires 100 ml of water, so we multiply the number of units by 100: 8 * 100 = 800 ml.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, we can start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write an equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write an equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

2B + 0.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

2.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.01:

B = 2250

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(2250)
R = 2227.5

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(2250)
G = 2260.5

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 2260.5 - 2227.5
G - R = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to add the three numbers and divide by 3.

Initial speed: 47 WPM
Increased speed: 52 WPM
New speed: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM

Now, let's add the three speeds:
47 + 52 + 57 = 156

To find the average, divide the sum by 3:
156 รท 3 = 52

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To determine the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in 5 weeks for each option.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. In 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. In 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.5}$"
"To calculate the total number of people attending the event, we need to consider the number of people initially invited by Alex, the number of friends she invited, and the number of friends' spouses.

First, let's calculate the total number of people invited by Alex and her friends. Alex invited 100 people, and each of them invited 2 friends. So, the total number of friends invited is 100 * 2 = 200. Additionally, Alex directly invited 10 friends, and 8 of them brought their spouses. This adds 10 + 8 = 18 more people to the total count.

Now, we can calculate the total number of people attending the event by adding the initial number of people invited by Alex, the number of friends invited, and the number of friends' spouses: 100 + 200 + 18 = 318.

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

318"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to follow the order of the weights given in the problem.

First, we know the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

Next, the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

Finally, the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{220}$"
"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

Cost of boots on eBay = $13
Shipping cost on eBay = 2 * $4 = $8
Total cost on eBay = $13 + $8 = $21

To find the difference in cost between Amazon and eBay, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay.

Difference in cost = Total cost on eBay - Total cost on Amazon
= $21 - $20
= $1

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we can use exponential growth since the beanstalk doubles its height every day. We can model this situation using the formula for exponential growth: 

A(t) = A0 * 2^t

where A(t) is the height of the beanstalk at time t, A0 is the initial height (4 feet), and t is the number of days.

We want to find the smallest integer value of t such that A(t) > 20.

4 < 4 * 2^t

Dividing both sides by 4:

1 < 2^t

Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides:

log2(1) < t

Since log2(1) = 0, we can simplify the inequality:

0 < t

This means that t must be greater than 0. Since t represents the number of days, it must be a positive integer. Therefore, the smallest integer value of t that satisfies the inequality is t = 1.

However, we need to check if t = 1 is indeed the correct answer. Plugging t = 1 into the original equation:

A(1) = 4 * 2^1
A(1) = 4 * 2
A(1) = 8

Since 8 is not greater than 20, we need to try the next integer value of t.

t = 2:

A(2) = 4 * 2^2
A(2) = 4 * 4
A(2) = 16

Since 16 is still not greater than 20, we try the next integer value of t.

t = 3:

A(3) = 4 * 2^3
A(3) = 4 * 8
A(3) = 32

Since 32 is greater than 20, we have found the correct value of t.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total grams of protein John gets per week, we need to calculate the grams of protein he gets per day and then multiply it by 7.

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, we can divide the total grams of mushrooms he eats per day by the grams of protein per cup to find the grams of protein per day.

200 grams of mushrooms รท 3 grams of protein per cup = 66.67 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the grams of protein per day by 7 to find the total grams of protein per week.

66.67 grams of protein per day ร 7 days per week = 466.67 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 466.67"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic methods. Let's represent Jerry's current age as 'x'. Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

Final answer: 13"
"To calculate the total cost of the dental work, we need to add the base price of the implants and the extra cost of the crown. The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000. The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find out how many hours George needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we can divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15). 

$3900 รท $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x, and the third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

We can write an equation to represent the sum of the angles:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

First, let's convert all the coins into cents: 
8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money in cents: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy: 345 รท 5 = 69.

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

Final Answer: The final answer is 69."
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and add them together.

Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that, so we need to subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The final weight Jamaal uses is 10 pounds."
"To calculate the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to break down his gaming purchases into three separate categories: birthday gifts, monthly purchases, and Christmas gifts.

Year 1:
- Birthday gift: 5 games
- Monthly purchases: 1 game/month * 12 months = 12 games
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- Christmas gift: 5 games
- Total games in Year 1: 17 (previous total) + 5 (Christmas) = 22 games

"To find the rate of the plane, we can use the formula:

Rate = Distance / Time

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time taken to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate. We can use the same formula:

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To find the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours, we need to calculate their individual production rates and then add them together.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find his hourly production rate, we divide 120 by 2, which gives us 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates as Ruiz makes in an hour. Since Ruiz makes 60 pounds in an hour, Marissa makes (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours:
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces Jim chews at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours and he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours, we can calculate the total number of pieces he chews at school as follows:

8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces

Additionally, Jim chews 1 piece of gum on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so the total number of pieces he chews outside of school is:

1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 2 pieces

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces Jim chews throughout the day:

4 (at school) + 2 (outside of school) = 6 pieces

Initially, Jim had 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has:

20 - 6 = 14 pieces left

Finally, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister. To find the number of pieces Jim has left, we subtract 7 from 14:

14 - 7 = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To find Charmaine's current age, we need to subtract 12 from 16.

16 - 12 = 4

Now, we need to add 4 to her current age to find her age 4 years from now.

4 + 4 = 8

Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now."
"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent is:
9 ร $3 = $27

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent is:
8 ร $14 = $112

Now, we need to find the difference between the two amounts:
$112 - $27 = $85

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find the number of bloomed flowers, we need to multiply the total number of flowers by the fraction that have bloomed.

Total flowers = 10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers
Fraction bloomed = 4/5

Number of bloomed flowers = Total flowers * Fraction bloomed
= 200 * 4/5
= 200 * 0.8
= 160

The number of flowers in Arianna's garden that have bloomed is 160."
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second and then to Mb per hour.

First, we know that 1 Mb = 1000 kb. So, we can convert 20 kb to Mb by dividing by 1000:

20 kb รท 1000 = 0.02 Mb

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the speed by 60:

0.02 Mb/second ร 60 seconds/minute ร 60 minutes/hour = 0.02 ร 60 ร 60 Mb/hour
= 72 Mb/hour

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To find the total number of cars towed that week, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

The tow truck pulled 10 cars per day for the first three days. So, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is 10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars.

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 6 cars per day (since it pulled 4 fewer cars per day). So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is 6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars.

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days to get the total number of cars towed that week: 30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height and his current height, then divide by his annual growth rate.

First, let's convert the required height to inches: 4 feet = 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, subtract Adam's current height from the required height: 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

Final answer: 4"
"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first.

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car.

The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost: $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright, we need to calculate 25% of 100, which is 0.25 * 100 = 25.

Since 60% of these riders are women, we need to find 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10.

So, 10 women can stay upright on the wave.

The number of men who can stay upright is 25 - 10 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of gold and silver jewels.

The price of a diamond jewel is $2000. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so we can calculate the price of a silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding the prices of diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we can use the information given in the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.

Next, we know he bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can add the number of each type of stamp together to find the total number of stamps: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed between them. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph = 15 mph

However, since they are moving in the same direction, we should consider the absolute difference in their speeds. The negative sign indicates that Tom is moving in the opposite direction.

Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Final answer: 5"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of fish caught by Naomi as N, the number caught by Darren as D, and the number caught by Tommy as T.

We are given that Naomi caught 17 fish, so N = 17.

We also know that Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, so D = N - 6.

Substituting the value of N, we get D = 17 - 6 = 11.

Now, we are told that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so T = D + 3.

Substituting the value of D, we get T = 11 + 3 = 14.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to consider the total cost of the classes and the maximum cost they are willing to pay per class.

The total cost of the classes is $60, and his parents are willing to pay a maximum of $10 per class. To find the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for, we can divide the total cost by the maximum cost per class.

Let's calculate the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for:

$60 รท $10 = 6 classes

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, we need to find out how many more classes he can miss before exceeding the maximum cost. To do this, we subtract the number of classes they are willing to pay for from the total number of classes:

10 (total classes) - 6 (maximum classes they are willing to pay for) = 4

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total weekly production, we need to calculate the daily production of both Julie and Jewel.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total daily production is 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to represent the information given. Let's denote the number of miles Lynn ran as 'L'. Since Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, Reggie ran 5(4) = 20 miles. We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so we can set up the equation:

20 = L + 3

To find the value of L, we need to isolate L by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

L = 20 - 3
L = 17

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 apples is 5 x $5.20 = $26.00
The cost of 5 oranges is 5 x $3.30 = $16.50

The total cost is $26.00 + $16.50 = $42.50

The final answer is: $42.50"
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3.

Time = Volume * 3
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade is $7,500. Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new salary, we need to first calculate the raise and bonus.

The raise is 5% of his current salary of $20,000. To find 5% of $20,000, we multiply $20,000 by 0.05.

$20,000 x 0.05 = $1,000

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $20,000 / 2 = $10,000.

Now, we add the raise and bonus to his current salary to find his new monthly salary.

$20,000 + $1,000 (raise) + $10,000 (bonus) = $31,000

To find his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12.

$31,000 x 12 = $372,000

The final answer is: $372,000"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of suits: 10 suits * $750 per suit = $7,500
The cost of dress pants: 10 pants * (1/5 * $750) = 10 * $150 = $1,500
The cost of dress shirts: 10 shirts * $60 per shirt = $600

Now, let's add the costs together: $7,500 + $1,500 + $600 = $9,600

The total cost of everything is $9,600."
"To calculate the total number of articles published by the two websites in February, we need to multiply the number of articles published per day by the number of days in the month.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and the sister company publishes 10 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, we can multiply the number of articles published per day by the number of days:

20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, let's add the total number of articles published by both websites:
560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we know Steve is 60 years old. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.

Since their son is half as old as his mom, we can calculate his age by dividing his mom's age by 2. So, the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.

Now, we know the son's age, and we're told his wife is 3 years younger than him. To find her age, we subtract 3 from the son's age: 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is 29."
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags.

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Since there are three bags, the total amount of flour is 3 * 16 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add them together.

Alisa biked at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. We can use the formula: Distance = Speed ร Time. So, the distance Alisa biked is:
Distance = 12 miles/hour ร 4.5 hours
Distance = 12 ร 4.5
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. Using the same formula, the distance Stanley biked is:
Distance = 10 miles/hour ร 2.5 hours
Distance = 10 ร 2.5
Distance = 25 miles

Now, let's add the distances together:
Total Distance = Distance biked by Alisa + Distance biked by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

Since Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, we can calculate the time it takes to dig through 24 feet of soil by dividing the distance by the rate:

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time = 6 hours

For the clay, Bill can dig half that fast, which means he can dig 2 feet/hour. To find the time it takes to dig through 8 feet of clay, we can divide the distance by the rate:

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time = 4 hours

The total time is the sum of the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay:

Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to calculate the number of cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.

Since Howie wants to get one of each type of cupcake (vanilla and chocolate) for everyone, we'll multiply the number of people by 2.

Number of people = 1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27

Total number of cupcakes = 27 x 2 = 54

Therefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"To find the initial number of likes, we need to divide the total number of likes by 70.

Total likes = 2000 + 20000 = 22000
Initial likes = Total likes / 70
Initial likes = 22000 / 70
Initial likes = 314.29

Since we can't have a fraction of a like, we can round down to 314 likes.

Now, we add the 20000 new likes to the initial likes to find the total number of likes.

Total likes = Initial likes + 20000
Total likes = 314 + 20000
Total likes = 20114

The final answer is 20114."
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off. So, the total cost on Tuesday is:
20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
$2 discount = $400 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost on Wednesday is:
20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
10% discount = $600 * 0.1 = $60
$60 discount = $600 - $60 = $540

The difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $398 - $540 = -$142.

The final answer is: $142"
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we need to calculate the sales for each month.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first month, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. So, the sales from green hats in the first month were 2 x $400 = $800.

2. The total sales in the first month were $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

3. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month, which is 3/4 x $1200 = $900.

4. The total sales in two months were $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To calculate the total cost of the horse-drawn carriage, we need to break down the hours into paid and unpaid time. James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30.

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her weekly wage.

Weekly wage: $300
Bank account balance: $420

Subtract the bank account balance from the weekly wage:
$300 - $420 = -$120

Since the result is negative, it means that Sally's bank account was overdrawn by $120. This means that $120 was withheld from her wage.

The amount withheld from Sally's wage is $120."
"To determine the number of eggs Lori needs, we can multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat.

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3

Total deviled egg halves needed: 16 x 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 2 deviled egg halves per egg, we can divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs needed.

Total eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

To convert the total number of eggs to dozens, we can divide by 12.

Total dozens of eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

The final answer is 2."
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to calculate the remaining pages after subtracting the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages.

Total pages = 15
Pages already written = 1/3 of 15 = 5

Pages left to write = Total pages - Pages already written

Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"To determine how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we can use the formula:

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day

Given that the total number of pages is 200 and Mike plans to read 10 pages per day, we can plug in the values as follows:

Number of days = 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we can subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline:

Days before deadline = 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5,000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the monthly rent, which is $5,000 x 2 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is $5,000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost for the first year is $15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

The total cost of the plane for the first year is $150,000 (plane cost) + $180,000 (total monthly cost) = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To find the total cooking time, we need to calculate the time it took to cook each food item. We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, the combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. The cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we add up the cooking times for all three foods: 30 minutes for rice, 50 minutes for pork, and 40 minutes for beans. The total cooking time is 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20.

The total number of animal legs is 70, so we can write the equation:
4s + 2g = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so we can write another equation:
s + g = 20

We can solve for 's' by substituting the value of 'g' from the second equation into the first equation.

Rearranging the second equation to isolate 'g', we get:
g = 20 - s

Substituting this expression for 'g' into the first equation, we get:
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s + 40 = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the cost of the coffee and the donut separately. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, that's 7 pounds. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is $1, so the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. 

7 pounds of the more expensive brand will cost 7 x $6 = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2. 

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

"To find out how much money each person would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, we need to follow these steps:

First, we know that Aurelia has $120.

Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's amount by multiplying Aurelia's amount by 3/4. This gives us (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so we add 60 to Kassidy's amount to find Rayna's amount: 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add up the money of all three: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To share the money equally among them, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 รท 3 = 120 dollars.

So, each person would have $120.

The game is divided into 4 quarters, each lasting 12 minutes. We can calculate the total time of the regular quarters by multiplying the number of quarters by the length of each quarter:

4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

Since the last quarter was extended by 5 minutes due to a tie, we need to add this extra time to the total:

48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

Therefore, the entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate 20% of 20% of the total employees.

First, find 20% of 50 employees:
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 employees

Now, find 30% of the 10 employees who are management:
30% of 10 = 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees

So, there are 3 employees who oversee the entire company."
"To determine the total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins, we need to multiply the amount of each ingredient by the number of muffins.

For flour: 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons
For sugar: 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons
For salt: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

Total amount of dry ingredients needed: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons

The final answer is: $\boxed{132}$"
"To find the total amount of candy, we need to add the amount of candy each person had: 
3 (Robert) + 5 (Cindy) + 4 (Aaron) = 12 pounds

Since they want to share it equally, we divide the total amount by 3:
12 รท 3 = 4

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy."
"To find the total cost of the candies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of candy and add them together.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 x $0.5 = $3.50.
The cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 x $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Since Adam paid the cashier $15, we can find the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount paid: $15 - $11 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to break down the information given.

We know that Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. The first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral. This means the first 24 days are accounted for. We are also given that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. So, we need to add these to the total number of good days.

Let's calculate the number of good days left:

Total good days initially = 12
Good days in the next 3 days = 3
Total good days = 12 + 3 = 15

Since the first 12 good days are already accounted for, we need to subtract those from the total good days to find the number of good days left:

Good days left = Total good days - Good days initially
Good days left = 15 - 12
Good days left = 3

The final answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic methods. Let's represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To isolate 'x', we need to get rid of the '+3' on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides:

2x + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we need to get 'x' by itself. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

(2x) / 2 = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books."
"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. To do this, we subtract the current height from the target height: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate: 360 / 30 = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

Final answer: 12"
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, which means each dog needs 1 toy. This is a straightforward calculation, as the number of dogs and the number of toys are equal.

Next, there are 8 more dogs in the shelter, making the total number of dogs 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys.

However, when James came back, he found that 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needs those toys. This means he needs 12 - 3 = 9 toys.

Since James initially had 4 toys, he needs to buy 9 - 4 = 5 more toys.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 9 (initially needed) + 5 (additional needed) = 14 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the steps below:

First, we find out how much Dylan invested. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we multiply 1200 by 2/5:

1200 * (2/5) = 480

Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount:

1200 - 480 = 720

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. We multiply 720 by 2/3:

720 * (2/3) = 480

Now, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find Skyler's investment:

720 - 480 = 240

So, Skyler's investment was $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we need to calculate the difference between their goal and the number of signatures they already have. 

Let's start by adding the number of signatures Carol and Jennifer have: 
20 (Carol's signatures) + 44 (Jennifer's signatures) = 64 signatures

Since they want to reach 100 signatures, we need to subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal: 
100 (goal) - 64 (current signatures) = 36 signatures

The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns, we need to calculate her daily earnings first. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns $20 per hour.

Since Karen works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings are:

"To find the excess weight, we need to calculate the total weight of the 9 people. Since each adult weighs 80 kg, we can multiply this by 9.

Total weight = 9 x 80 kg = 720 kg

The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg. To find the excess weight, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

The elevator's maximum load will be exceeded by 20 kg."
"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has and then add them up.

We know that Katarina has 68 cookies, which is 5 less than Max's cookies. So, we can find Max's cookies by adding 5 to Katarina's cookies:

Max's cookies = Katarina's cookies + 5
Max's cookies = 68 + 5
Max's cookies = 73

Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we can find the Cookie Monster's cookies by subtracting 12 from Max's cookies:

Cookie Monster's cookies = Max's cookies - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 73 - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 61

We also know that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so we can find Summer's cookies by adding 23 to Max's cookies:

Summer's cookies = Max's cookies + 23
Summer's cookies = 73 + 23
Summer's cookies = 96

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies:

Total cookies = Katarina's cookies + Max's cookies + Cookie Monster's cookies + Summer's cookies
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
Total cookies = 298

The final answer is: $\boxed{298}$"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to first find the length before the 50% extension. Let's denote the original length as x.

The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm is added to the bottom of the dress. The final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

The original length of the dress was 80cm."
"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we can calculate the total time by adding the time taken for both modes. 

Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode = 40 minutes

Total time = 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes

The final answer is 100."
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the remaining time available.

They have a total of 30 minutes to get to school. So far, they've spent 6 minutes walking to the corner and 13 minutes walking to the fire station. 

Time spent so far = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Time left = Total time available - Time spent so far
Time left = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Time left = 11 minutes

Therefore, they have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4. Since Catherine buys 1 kilo, the total cost for apples is $4.

The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 x $2 = $4.

The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 x $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that there are two sets of siblings: one set of twins and one set of triplets. Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as x. Since there are three triplets, the combined ages of the triplets would be 3x.

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. Let's denote the age of the older twin as (x + 7). Since there are two twins, the combined ages of the twins would be 2(x + 7).

The total combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. We can set up the equation:

3x + 2(x + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 2x + 14 = 44

Combine like terms:

5x + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know the age of the younger triplet, we can find the age of the older twin:

Age of the older twin = x + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13

"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 120 (12 months in a year).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Total coins Rong saves in a year = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Total coins Neil saves in a year = 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Total coins Rong saves in 10 years = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Total coins Neil saves in 10 years = 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

Total coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins

"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to find the total number of chairs required. Since there are 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we can calculate the total number of chairs needed as follows:

Total number of chairs = Number of adults + Number of babies
Total number of chairs = 42 + 15
Total number of chairs = 57

Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

Number of regular chairs = 5 * Number of high chairs
Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8
Number of regular chairs = 40

Now, we can find the total number of chairs the restaurant already has:

Total number of chairs = Number of high chairs + Number of regular chairs
Total number of chairs = 8 + 40
Total number of chairs = 48

To find the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the total number of chairs the restaurant already has from the total number of chairs required:

"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in two weeks, which is 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the number of tiles needed, we need to calculate two thirds of 36 square feet. 

Two thirds of 36 can be calculated as (2/3) * 36. 

To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator (2) by the whole number (36) and keep the denominator (3) the same. 

(2 * 36) / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply 24 by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

576"
"To calculate the cost of picking blueberries, we need to consider the initial cost of going to the picking site and the cost per pound of blueberries. James paid $20 to go picking and then $1.5 per pound for 30 pounds of blueberries. 

The total cost of picking blueberries is $20 + $1.5 * 30 = $20 + $45 = $65.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of buying blueberries at the store, which is $2.5 per pound for 30 pounds. The cost of buying blueberries at the store is $2.5 * 30 = $75.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself.

"To find the number of people who accept the position, we need to calculate the percentage of people who receive a job offer and then find a third of that number.

First, we calculate the number of people who receive a job offer. Since 30% of the 100 applicants receive interviews, and 20% of those receive a job offer, we can multiply 30% by 20% to find the number of people who receive a job offer.

0.3 * 0.2 = 0.06, or 6% of the original 100 applicants receive a job offer. To find the actual number, we multiply 6% by 100.

6% of 100 = 0.06 * 100 = 6 people receive a job offer.

Now, we need to find a third of the people who receive a job offer. A third of 6 is 6 / 3 = 2.

"To calculate the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to consider the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the cost of the fine and the cost of the asphalt.

The cost of fixing the pothole is $450 (damage to the car) + $120 (fine) + $75 (3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each) = $645.

The cost of not fixing the pothole is $450 (damage to the car).

So, the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself is $645 (total cost of fixing the pothole) - $450 (cost of not fixing the pothole) = $195.

Therefore, Ron saves $195 by fixing the pothole himself."
"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

Let's break it down:

Total normal chairs: 170
Total baby chairs: 23
Total chairs: 170 + 23 = 193

Chairs sent for repair: 20 (normal) + 13 (baby) = 33

Chairs left: 193 - 33 = 160

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find the total number of slices left, we need to calculate the slices eaten by each group and subtract that from the total number of slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ยพ of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate ยพ * 12 = 9 slices.

Total slices eaten = 8 + 9 = 17 slices.

Since there were 5 pizzas in total, the number of slices left is 5 * 12 - 17 = 25.

The final answer is 25."
"To find the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat.

Time taken by the cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by the dog = (2/3) * 30 minutes
= 20 minutes

Now, we need to find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog.

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2
= (30 + 20) / 2
= 50 / 2
= 25 minutes

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be expressed as:

9x + 10 = length of Topher's shoe

We are also given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. To convert this to inches, we multiply the feet by 12 and add the inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.

Now we can set up the equation:

9x + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

9x = 90

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed by students and teachers separately.

Number of windows smashed by students: 
Number of students' cars = 64

"To find the percentage of blue spools, we need to calculate the total number of blue spools and then divide it by the total number of spools.

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can calculate the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted and subtract that from the total number of people.

First, we calculate the number of people who voted by midday. Since 2/5 of the people voted, we multiply 2/5 by 5000.

2/5 * 5000 = 2000

Now, we subtract the number of people who voted by midday from the total number of people to find the remaining people.

5000 - 2000 = 3000

Next, we calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00. 2/3 of the remaining people voted, so we multiply 2/3 by 3000.

2/3 * 3000 = 2000

Now, we subtract the number of people who voted by 16:00 from the remaining people to find the number of people who had not voted.

3000 - 2000 = 1000

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need, we can divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last (30 days) by the number of pieces of gum he chews per day (4).

Let's perform the calculation:

Number of packs = Total days / Pieces of gum per day
= 30 days / 4 pieces of gum per day
= 7.5

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure he has enough gum for the entire 30 days. Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we need to calculate the total number of smores required. 

First, we calculate the total number of smores needed for the kids and adults: 
9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores
Total smores needed = 18 + 6 = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves by 3 to find the number of boxes needed:
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box

Therefore, 1 box of graham crackers is needed.

Final answer: 1"
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we know Dora's age is 15 years. We can use this information to find her father's age. Since her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, we can set up an equation:

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
= 2 * 15 + 8
= 38

Next, we know Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we can find her mother's age by subtracting 4 from her father's age:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
= 38 - 4
= 34

Now, we can find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their individual ages:

Combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
= 15 + 38 + 34
= 87

The final answer is: $\boxed{87}$"

"To calculate the daily savings, we need to find the difference in cost between the old vendor and the new vendor.

The old vendor sells tomatoes for $0.5 each, and the new vendor sells them for $0.4 each. The difference in cost per tomato is $0.5 - $0.4 = $0.1.

Since the vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, the daily savings can be calculated as:

Daily savings = (Cost per tomato) * (Number of tomatoes sold per day)
= $0.1 * 500
= $50

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7:

Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7

"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to set up a system of equations. Let's denote the number of marbles Carl has as C, the number of marbles Sean has as S, and the number of marbles Cal has as L.

We know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so we can write an equation: S = 0.5L.

We also know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so we can write another equation: C = 4S.

Given that Sean has 56 marbles, we can substitute S = 56 into the first equation to find L: 56 = 0.5L, which gives us L = 112.

Now that we know L, we can find C by substituting S = 56 into the second equation: C = 4(56) = 224.

Finally, we can find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined by adding their marbles together: C + L = 224 + 112 = 336.

"To determine the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students (54) by the number of groups required (6).

54 รท 6 = 9

Since the question asks for the number of groups needed to form, and we already have 12 groups, we can calculate the difference between the required groups and the existing groups.

12 (existing groups) - 6 (required groups) = 6

However, this calculation is incorrect as it implies that 6 more groups are needed to meet the requirement of 6 groups. The correct approach is to find the difference between the total number of students and the product of the number of students per group and the required number of groups.

Let's recalculate:

6 (required groups) * 9 (students per group) = 54

Since we already have 54 students, we don't need to add any more groups. The correct answer is that no additional groups are needed.

"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent in two 4-week months, we need to find the total number of weekdays and weekend days in 8 weeks.

There are 5 weekdays in a week, and 2 weekend days in a week. In 8 weeks, there are 5 * 8 = 40 weekdays and 2 * 8 = 16 weekend days.

Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in 8 weeks is 40 * 60 = 2400.

Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in 8 weeks is 16 * 100 = 1600.

The total number of chairs rented in 8 weeks is 2400 + 1600 = 4000.

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out 4000 chairs in two 4-week months.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it. If we denote the number of votes against the regulation as x, then the number of votes in favor is 2x.

Since the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation:

2x = 2(11) = 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

Final answer: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total number of shirts ordered, we can break down the information provided:

Let's denote the number of students needing each size as follows:
- Extra-small: x
- Small: 2x
- Medium: 2x - 4
- Large: (2x - 4) / 2
- Extra-large: ((2x - 4) / 2) + 6

Since we know that 11 students need size extra-small, we can set up the equation:
x = 11

Now, we can find the number of students for each size:
- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 2 * 11 = 22
- Medium: 2 * 11 - 4 = 18
- Large: (2 * 11 - 4) / 2 = 9
- Extra-large: ((2 * 11 - 4) / 2) + 6 = 15

To find the total number of shirts, we add the number of students for each size:
11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 5% of the marked price. 

Discount = 5% of $140
= 0.05 * 140
= $7

Now, subtract the discount amount from the marked price to get the final price.

Final price = Marked price - Discount amount
= $140 - $7
= $133

The final price after the discount is $133."
"To find the total number of hours the playlists will last, we need to multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist and then multiply that by the length of each song.

Number of playlists: 20
Number of songs in each playlist: 300
Length of each song: 10 hours

Total number of songs: 20 * 300 = 6000
Total hours: 6000 * 10 = 60,000 hours

The 20 playlists will last for 60,000 hours in total."
"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we need to calculate the percentage of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win, and then subtract that from the total number of people.

First, we find the number of people who think horse #2 will win: 20% of 50 people, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

Next, we find the number of people who think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. Then, 60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The total number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win is 10 + 24 = 34 people. To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we subtract this from the total number of people: 50 - 34 = 16 people.

Therefore, 16 people think horse #12 will win."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportions. We know that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's set up a proportion to find the total number of Pomeranians:
1/3 : 6 = 1 : x
To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
1x = 6 * 3
x = 18

Since 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up another proportion:
2/3 : 18 = 2/3 : Total Puppies
To find the total number of puppies, we can cross-multiply:
2 * Total Puppies = 18 * 3
2 * Total Puppies = 54
Total Puppies = 54 / 2
Total Puppies = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To determine how much Jayden needs to buy the camera, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. Jayden initially had $70 from selling pictures. His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. We can calculate the total amount of money Jayden has by adding the money he already has to the money Ava gave him:

$70 + $45 = $115

Since the camera costs $200, we can find out how much more Jayden needs by subtracting the total amount he has from the cost of the camera:

$200 - $115 = $85

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

Final Answer: The final answer is: $85"
"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first determine the amount needed for the first house. Since the first house needs half of the total 250 cases, we can calculate this as:

250 cases / 2 = 125 cases

The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so we multiply the amount for the first house by 2:

125 cases * 2 = 250 cases

Therefore, the third house needs 250 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 250"
"To calculate the total amount spent, we need to find the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spends 5 x $1 = $5.

"To find the number of pears, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas and add it to the number of bananas.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate 45% of 200 bananas:
45% = 0.45
0.45 * 200 = 90

2. Add the result to the number of bananas:
200 (bananas) + 90 (45% of bananas) = 290

Since we are asked to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears:
290 (total fruits)

The final answer is: 290"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money she had initially.

Initial amount of money = $80
Cost of the ball = $20
Remaining money = Initial amount of money - Cost of the ball
Remaining money = $80 - $20 = $60

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many candy bars Marissa bought.

Number of candy bars = Remaining money / Cost of each candy bar
Number of candy bars = $60 / $5
Number of candy bars = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the cost of making 4 liters of juice, we need to calculate the total amount of oranges required and then multiply it by the cost per kilogram.

Since 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters will require 5 * 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

The cost of 1 kilogram of oranges is $3. Therefore, the total cost of 20 kilograms of oranges is 20 * $3 = $60.

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"To find the total number of books read, we need to first determine how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find out how many Ahmed read.

Ezra read 300 books initially, and then he read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is 300 + 150 = 450.

Now, we can divide 450 by 2 to find out how many books Ahmed read: 450 / 2 = 225.

Now, we add the number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed to find the total number of books read: 450 (Ezra) + 225 (Ahmed) = 675.

The final answer is: $\boxed{675}$"
"To calculate Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we need to break it down into two parts: her hourly wage and the daily bonus.

First, let's calculate her earnings for Monday. She teaches 4 classes for 5 hours, so her total hours worked is 4 * 5 = 20 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her earnings for Monday would be 20 hours * $15 per hour = $300.

Next, we need to check if she earns a daily bonus. Since she teaches more than 3 classes on Monday, she earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday would be $300 + $5 = $305.

Now, let's calculate her earnings for Wednesday. She teaches 2 classes for 2 hours, so her total hours worked is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her earnings for Wednesday would be 4 hours * $15 per hour = $60.

Since she teaches 2 classes on Wednesday, she does not earn a daily bonus. So, her total earnings for Wednesday remain $60.

Now, we add her earnings for both days:
$305 + $60 = $365

The final answer is: $365"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

20 - 16 = 4

The company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to the fruity scents.

Final answer: 4"
"To determine how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he made from selling eggplants. Since he sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, we can multiply the number of eggplants by the price per eggplant:

20 eggplants * $3/eggplant = $60

Now, we need to find out how much more money Bennet needs to make to reach his goal of $135. We can do this by subtracting the amount he made from eggplants from his goal:

$135 - $60 = $75

Since Bennet has 25 ears of corn, we can divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn to find the price per ear:

$75 รท 25 ears = $3/ear

To express this as a multiple-choice question, we can rephrase it as:

What is the price per ear of corn that Bennet should sell for to reach his goal of $135?

A) $2

"To determine the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we need to calculate the total time she spends on other activities and subtract that from her total weekend time.

Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, for a total of 12 hours. She spends 3 hours reading and 3 hours playing video games. 

First, we calculate the total time spent on other activities: 3 hours (reading) + 3 hours (video games) = 6 hours.

Now, we subtract this from her total weekend time: 12 hours - 6 hours = 6 hours.

Since she spends 6 hours playing soccer, we can calculate the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer by dividing the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiplying by 100:

(6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.

The final answer is 50."

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 50 - 25 = 25 pencils
3. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 25 - 15 = 10 pencils

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum.

The time it takes to drive to the museum can be calculated using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, the distance is 150 miles and the speed is 75 mph.

Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home, we need to double the time:
Total time to drive to and from the museum = 2 hours * 2
Total time to drive to and from the museum = 4 hours

Adding the time spent at the museum:
Total time gone from home = Total time to drive to and from the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time gone from home = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"

The number of wheels for the cars is 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels.
The number of wheels for the motorcycles is 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels.

The total number of wheels needed is 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

Now, let's subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

The number of wheels left in the box is 276."
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, you need to find 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The original price of the laptop is $1000. 

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

You have to pay $800."
"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
Number of movies in series = 600 / 3
Number of movies in series = 200

Since Mike can get the series for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, we need to find the cost of the series:

Cost of series = Number of movies in series * $6
Cost of series = 200 * $6
Cost of series = $1200

Next, we need to find the number of remaining movies that are not in series. We can do this by subtracting the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
Number of remaining movies = 600 - 200
Number of remaining movies = 400

Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate the number of older movies as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of remaining movies * 0.4
Number of older movies = 400 * 0.4
Number of older movies = 160

The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so we can calculate the total cost of the older movies:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * $5
Cost of older movies = 160 * $5
Cost of older movies = $800

Now, we need to find the cost of the normal movies. Since there are 400 remaining movies and 160 of them are older movies, the number of normal movies is:

Number of normal movies = Number of remaining movies - Number of older movies
Number of normal movies = 400 - 160
Number of normal movies = 240

Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * $10
Cost of normal movies = 240 * $10
Cost of normal movies = $2400

Finally, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies by adding the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies:

Total cost = Cost of series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
Total cost = $1200 + $800 + $2400
Total cost = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"

Apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Total cost = $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we can calculate it as follows:
Driving speed = 50 miles per hour
Half of the driving speed = 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour
Hiking speed = 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour

Now, we know the time they spent hiking (1.5 hours) and their hiking speed (20 miles per hour). We can use the formula:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 20 * 1.5
Distance = 30 miles

The distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles."
"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we need to calculate their individual scores based on the given information.

Let's break down the scoring system:

- 10 points for every enemy jumped on
- 5 points for every berry collected
- 30 points for every second left on the timer when the level is finished

We know that Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava and jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava. Let's assume Ava's score is A and Emma's score is E.

Since Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, Emma collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries. Ava collects 8 - 5 = 3 berries.

Emma jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so Emma jumps on 0 enemies. Ava jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies.

Emma finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so Emma finishes the level in 30 seconds. Ava finishes the level in 30 + 4 = 34 seconds.

Now, let's calculate their scores:

Ava's score: 80 * 10 (for enemies) + 3 * 5 (for berries) + 34 * 30 (for time) = 800 + 15 + 1020 = 1835

Emma's score: 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 900 = 940

The difference between their scores is 1835 - 940 = 895.

The final answer is: 895"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days, so:
3 * 5 = 15

On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual amount, so:
2 * 3 * 2 = 12

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on both types of days:
15 + 12 = 27

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes a total of 27 times in a week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. He took out 14 orange fish and 3 white fish. Now, he has -11 orange fish and 1 white fish.

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

-11 = 2(1)

However, this equation is not true. Let's re-evaluate the situation.

Let's say Bob took out x orange fish and y white fish. We know that x + y = 17 (since the total number of fish taken out is 17). We also know that the number of orange fish is now -11, and the number of white fish is 1.

We can set up two equations:

x = -11 (since the number of orange fish is now -11)
x + y = 17 (since the total number of fish taken out is 17)

Substituting x = -11 into the second equation, we get:

"To calculate the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to determine the total distance he travels in a week and then divide it by his fuel efficiency.

Since Andy travels to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles per day.

Total distance traveled in a week = 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles

Now, we can calculate the amount of gas consumed per week:

Gas consumed per week = Total distance traveled / Fuel efficiency
= 50 miles / 10 MPG
= 5 gallons

To find the cost of gas consumed per week, we multiply the gas consumed per week by the price per gallon:

Cost of gas consumed per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
= 5 gallons * $3/gallon
= $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To calculate the total amount Carrie paid for lunch, we need to find the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, then add them together.

Carrie had 10 twenties and spent 3/5 of them. To find the value of the twenties she spent, we multiply 3/5 by 20 (the value of one twenty).

(3/5) * 20 = (3 * 20) / 5 = 60 / 5 = 12

So, Carrie spent 12 twenties. She had 10 - 12 = -2 twenties left, but since you can't have a negative number of twenties, this means she didn't have 2 twenties to spend. We will ignore this part of the problem.

Carrie had 140 quarters. She spent all of them. The value of the quarters is 140 * 0.25 = 35 dollars.

The total amount she spent is 12 twenties (which is 12 * 20 = 240 dollars) + 35 dollars from the quarters.

The total amount she spent is 240 + 35 = 275 dollars.

The final answer is: $275"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately.

Tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes
Eggplants: 8 plants * 4 eggplants/plant = 32 eggplants

Total fruits = 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits

The final answer is: 142"
"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs.
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine how much money John is missing, we need to calculate the remaining cost of the trip after the school's contribution. Since the school covers half the cost, John needs to cover the other half.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school's contribution is $300 / 2 = $150. To find the amount John needs to cover, we subtract the school's contribution from the total cost: $300 - $150 = $150.

John has $50, so he is missing $150 - $50 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn, we need to calculate the temperature difference between the day and night, and then divide that by the temperature increase per log.

The temperature difference is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we divide the temperature difference by the heating capacity of one log:

12 / 5 = 2.4

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the house is warm enough. However, in this case, we can actually get away with burning 2 logs, as 2 x 5 = 10, which is close enough to the 12-degree difference.

Carson needs to burn 2 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

Final answer: 2"
"To determine the total number of seashells brought back, we need to calculate the number of groups and then multiply it by the number of seashells each group brought.

First, we divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group to find the number of groups: 90 people / 9 people per group = 10 groups.

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of 10 groups. To do this, we multiply 10 by 3/5:

10 * (3/5) = 10 * 3 / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6

Now, we multiply the number of groups that brought back seashells (6) by the number of seashells each group brought (2):

6 groups * 2 seashells per group = 12 seashells

The final answer is 12."
"To find the number of people on the train, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. Initially, there are 172 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so the number of people left is 172 - 47 = 125.
3. Then, 13 more people get on, so the number of people on the train is now 125 + 13 = 138.
4. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so the number of people left is 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train."
"To calculate the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the number of days in the month and then multiply that by the value of each bottle cap.

Number of bottle caps per day: 10
Number of days in the month: 30
Value of each bottle cap: $0.25

Total number of bottle caps in 30 days: 10 * 30 = 300
Total amount of money: 300 * $0.25 = $75

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To calculate Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to break it down into two parts: her regular earnings and her special earnings.

First, let's calculate her regular earnings for 8 hours of work:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

For the additional 3 hours, her special hourly rate is 150% of her regular rate, which is $20 * 1.5 = $30 per hour. So, her earnings for the additional hours are:
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

Now, let's add both amounts to find her total earnings for the day:
$160 + $90 = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of male lions first. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can divide the number of female lions by 2.

Number of male lions = 12 / 2 = 6

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find the amount of money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract that from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 x $40 = $10

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $40 - $10 = $30.

Now, we subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to find the total number of employees and then multiply it by the salary per employee.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, the total number of employees after 3 months will be:

- Month 1: 200 + 20 = 220
- Month 2: 220 + 20 = 240
- Month 3: 240 + 20 = 260

The total number of employees after 3 months is 260.

The salary per employee is $4000. To find the total salary paid per month, we multiply the total number of employees by the salary per employee:

260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000

To find the total salary paid after 3 months, we multiply the total salary paid per month by 3:

$1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

The final answer is: $3,120,000"
"To determine the total caroling time, we need to calculate the sum of the time for each song. 

""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice, so 2 x 150 = 300 seconds.
""Jingle Bells"" is sung once, so 1 x 240 = 240 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

Therefore, the total caroling time is 540 seconds.

Final answer: 540"
"To calculate Billy's earnings, we need to find his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Since Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings will be 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 

Sally also works 20 hours, so her total earnings will be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the difference in cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 x $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find Nikita's score, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and add 11 to it.

Pierson's score is 278. Half of this is 278 / 2 = 139. 
Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

Now, let's add their scores together: 
278 (Pierson's score) + 150 (Nikita's score) = 428.

The total score of Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To calculate the total number of trees planted, we need to find the total number of students and teachers, then multiply each by the respective number of trees planted by each group.

The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. So, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000.

Each teacher plants 2 trees, and there are 40 teachers. So, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 40 * 2 = 80.

The total number of trees planted is the sum of the trees planted by students and teachers, which is 1000 + 80 = 1080.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has and then determine the percentage of stuffed goats she needs.

First, let's add up the number of stuffed animals she already has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. We can set up the equation:

(14 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.3

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get:

14 + x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

14 + x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 14 from both sides gives:

x = 0.3x + 0.2

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides gives:

0.7x = 0.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7 gives:

x = 0.2 / 0.7
x = 2/7
x = 0.2857

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 2 stuffed goats to make the percentage 30% of all her stuffed animals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine how many hours Kris needs to play to earn the achievement, we need to calculate the total hours she has already played and subtract that from the required 30 hours.

Kris plays for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, she plays for 2 * 7 = 14 days. So, she plays for 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

In the last week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for 7 days. So, she plays for 7 * 2 = 14 hours in the last week.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. She has already played 21 hours, so she needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours more.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 2 * 60 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 2 * 70 = 140 miles.

Since the second car passed the first car, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them.

Distance between the two cars = 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total cost of the ring, we need to calculate the cost of the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost. 

First, we find 30% of the total cost of the ring, which is the sum of the diamond and gold costs. The total cost is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of $900. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.3.

$900 * 0.3 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the ring.

$900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Let's break it down:

Third-graders who passed: 340
Fourth-graders who passed: 40
Fifth-graders who passed: 2 * 40 = 80 (since their pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders)

Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460
Total students in the school: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100
= 46%

The final answer is: $\boxed{46\%}$"
"To find the length of the mosaic, we need to calculate the total area of the mosaic and then divide it by the height. Since the area of a rectangle is length * width, and we know the height (3 inches), we can find the length.

First, we need to find the total number of square inches Milo can make with the glass chips. We know that each bag holds 72 chips and it takes 12 chips to make one square inch. So, the total number of square inches is:

Total square inches = Total chips / Chips per square inch
= 2 bags * 72 chips per bag / 12 chips per square inch
= 144 / 12
= 12 square inches

Since the area of a rectangle is length * width, and we know the area (12 square inches) and the height (3 inches), we can find the length:

Length = Area / Height
= 12 square inches / 3 inches
= 4 inches

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the initial amount of tea, we need to calculate the total amount consumed and add it to the amount left.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed. 4 students drank 1.5 quarts each, so they drank 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts. 16 students drank 2 quarts each, so they drank 16 x 2 = 32 quarts. The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the initial amount of tea was 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts). So, 48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Dale initially had 100 candies and ordered 100 more, so the total number of candies he has is 100 + 100 = 200.

Since he sold 150 candies, we subtract this from the total number of candies: 200 - 150 = 50.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we need to find the total number of students at the end of May and subtract the initial number of students.

The number of students doubles every month. So, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month:

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles from 10 to 20.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles from 20 to 40.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles from 40 to 80.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles from 80 to 160.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles from 160 to 320.

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students, we subtract 10 from 320.

320 - 10 = 310

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Average branches per day = Total money / Cost per branch
Average branches per day = $105 / $0.25
Average branches per day = 420

Since Felix worked for 7 days, we can divide the total branches by 7 to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals Rose picked and subtract the number of petals she dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose picked:
15 (3 flowers with 5 petals each) + 24 (4 flowers with 6 petals each) + 20 (5 flowers with 4 petals each) + 42 (6 flowers with 7 petals each) = 101 petals

Now, let's subtract the number of petals she dropped (1 of each type):
5 (1 flower with 5 petals) + 6 (1 flower with 6 petals) + 4 (1 flower with 4 petals) + 7 (1 flower with 7 petals) = 22 petals

Total petals in the vase: 101 - 22 = 79 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"To find the total number of S'mores they can make, we need to subtract the number of marshmallows dropped from the total number of marshmallows.

Total marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Remaining marshmallows = 35 - 3 = 32

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the total number of S'mores they can make is 32.

John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2.

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 32 / 2 = 16

So, John and DeSean can each have 16 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

Final answer: 16"
"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the time each person played and multiply it by the cost per game.

Let's break it down:

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes per quarter, he will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

His friend who is significantly worse plays for half the time, so they play for 120 minutes. This person will use 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.

The other friend plays for 120 minutes as well, so they will also use 6 quarters.

The better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 1.5 * 240 = 360 minutes. This person will use 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

Now, let's add up the quarters used by each person: 12 + 6 + 6 + 18 = 42 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is 42 * $0.25 = $10.50.

The final answer is: $10.50"
"To find the amount of oil used, we need to understand the relationships between the ingredients. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so let's call this amount x. Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil used is 2x. We also know that she uses twice as much salt as zest, so the amount of salt used is 2x.

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and it's the sum of the amounts of salt, citrus zest, fragrance, and oil. We can set up the equation:

x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms:

5x = 10

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 2

Now that we know the amount of salt used is 2 ounces, we can find the amount of oil used:

Oil = 2x = 2 * 2 = 4 ounces

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

The total amount of money John spent is $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we can subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Let's calculate the number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy:

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already has = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already has
= 63 - 48
= 15

Therefore, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which gives us 40 * 0.2 = 8 cars.

After selling 8 cars, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Finally, after giving away 16 cars, Joe is left with 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to divide the total amount raised by the charity by the number of students. 

The charity raised a total of $175,000, and $50,000 came from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we divide the amount raised by students by the number of students: $125,000 รท 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the second day first.

Time walked on the first day = 8 hours
Time walked on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Total time walked in two days = 8 + 4 = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes)
Total time in minutes = 12 * 60 = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars. To find the number of cars left, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35.

Therefore, Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break."
"To calculate John's weekly earnings, we need to multiply the number of tasks he completes in a week by the payment per task.

Number of tasks per cycle = 5
Number of cycles per day = 30
Number of days in a week = 7

Total number of tasks per week = 5 * 30 * 7 = 1050

Payment per task = $1.20

Total weekly earnings = 1050 * $1.20 = $1260

The final answer is $1260."
"To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's add the points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we need to calculate the total number of tins of each type of food.

The total number of tins of cat food is 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins.

The total number of tins of dog food is 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins.

Now, subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference:
88 - 36 = 52

The difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food is 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the number of cards each person has.

Let's say PJ has x cards. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and add them together.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together:
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To calculate the amount Milly will lose, we need to consider the cost of shipping and the refund amount.

The cost of shipping is calculated as follows:
Weight: 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
Distance: 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate the refund amount:
Refund amount = 0.75 * $32 = $24

To find the amount Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the purchase price and then add the shipping cost:
Amount Milly will lose = Purchase price + Shipping cost - Refund amount
= $32 + $3 - $24
= $11

The final answer is: $11"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had.

Mulan initially had $40. Her father gave her $100, making her total amount $140. She then buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each and a bag for $20. The total cost of these items is $60 + $20 = $80.

To find the amount of money Mulan has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $140 - $80 = $60.

Therefore, Mulan has $60 left."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

Boris produces 8,000 bars in the first week. In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Since the production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars, we can subtract this from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

Total monthly production: 50,000 bars
Production for the first three weeks: 36,000 bars
Production for the fourth week: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and add them together.

First, let's calculate the time she spends writing songs and doing makeup. 

Time spent writing songs: 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours
Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes/week * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours/week
Total time spent on TikTok per week: 8 hours + 1.5 hours = 9.5 hours/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total time spent on TikTok per week by 4: 9.5 hours/week * 4 weeks = 38 hours

The final answer is 38."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the items into standard and additional items.

The standard items are: 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of these items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. We need to find the number of additional items:
- Mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 extra mirrors
- Chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 extra chandelier
- Pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 extra pictures

The cost of the additional items is:
- 2 extra mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
- 1 extra chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
- 10 extra pictures * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

The total cost for Angela is: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to break down the information given. We know that Eva has saved $20. Since Anthony has $10 more than Eva, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10
Anthony's savings = $20 + $10
Anthony's savings = $30

Now, we know that Roy has 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's money, we multiply Anthony's money by 0.4. 40% of $30 is 0.4 x $30 = $12.

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's money to find Roy's money. $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To find the height Naruto can lift, we need to follow the given information step by step:

We know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Then, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches. Next, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches. Finally, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To find the total distance traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first 4 hours + Distance in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of one kangaroo first. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for 4 turtles to travel across the highway by dividing the total distance by the speed of a turtle. However, we don't know the distance. We can use the fact that the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles. We can set up an equation using the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway.

Time = Distance / Speed
Since we don't know the distance, let's use the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway.

Time taken by kangaroos = Time taken by turtles
18 hours = 4 * Time taken by a turtle
Time taken by a turtle = 18 hours / 4
Time taken by a turtle = 4.5 hours

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 4.5 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4.5}$"
"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we can use the information given in the problem. 

Let's denote the number of dishes Kora made as K, the number of dishes Rory made as R, and the number of dishes Jada made as J. We know that K = 20, R = K + 20, and J = 2R.

We can substitute the value of K into the equation R = K + 20 to find the value of R: 
R = 20 + 20 
R = 40

Now, we can find the value of J by substituting the value of R into the equation J = 2R:
J = 2 * 40 
J = 80

Now, let's add up the number of dishes each one made: 
J + R + K = 80 + 40 + 20 
J + R + K = 140

The total number of clay dishes they all made together is 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already has some savings in her purse, and she has been paid $150 for her part-time job. Her mom also agreed to give her $80. So, the total amount she has is the sum of these three amounts.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as x. We know that x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 (the amount she still needs to buy the laptop).

x + 230 = 350

Now, let's solve for x:

x = 350 - 230
x = 120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"To find the total number of apple slices, we need to calculate the number of slices from the large apples and the small apples separately.

First, let's calculate the number of slices from the large apples. Since 1 large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, 3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 slices.

Next, let's calculate the number of slices from the small apples. Since 1 small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, 5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Now, we add the number of slices from the large apples and the small apples to find the total number of slices. Total number of slices = 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can divide the desired daily milk production (25 liters) by the amount of milk one cow produces per day (5 liters).

25 liters รท 5 liters/cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we subtract this from the total number of cows needed to meet the desired production level.

5 cows (total needed) - 3 cows (already have) = 2 cows

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Final answer: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 5/6 by the original length of 12 mm:
(5/6) * 12 = 10 mm

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/3 by the original length of 12 mm:
(1/3) * 12 = 4 mm

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/2 by the original length of 12 mm:
(1/2) * 12 = 6 mm

Now, we add the lengths of the used parts together:
10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 mm."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks he has by dividing 60 by 2.

Let's calculate the number of socks Jack has:
60 รท 2 = 30 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying 30 by 2.

30 ร 2 = 60 socks

Now, we can find the total number of socks they have together:
30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) = 90 socks

We also know that Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so we can find the number of dishes Jack has by multiplying 30 by 2.

30 ร 2 = 60 dishes

Since Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, we can find the number of dishes Peter has by dividing 60 by 2.

60 รท 2 = 30 dishes

Now, we can find the total number of dishes they have together:
60 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 90 dishes

90 (socks) + 90 (dishes) = 180

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"To find the total number of students good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

Let's denote the total number of students as T, the number of students good at math only as M, the number of students good at English only as E, and the number of students good at both math and English as B.

We know that T = 20, M = 5, and E = 8. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students good at math, which is M + B.

Since the total number of students is the sum of students good at math only, students good at English only, and students good at both subjects, we can write the equation as:

T = M + E + B

Substituting the given values, we get:

20 = 5 + 8 + B

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 = 13 + B

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:

B = 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English:

Total number of students good at math = M + B
= 5 + 7

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total available time for performances and subtract the time taken by each group.

The total time of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. We also need to consider the 10-minute intermission. So, the total available time for performances is:

Total available time = Total time of the concert - Time of intermission
= 120 minutes - 10 minutes
= 110 minutes

Now, we can calculate the number of groups that can perform by dividing the total available time by the time taken by each group:

Number of groups = Total available time / Time taken by each group
= 110 minutes / 10 minutes
= 11

Since Vicki can't have a fraction of a group, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the maximum number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is 3/4 of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

Year 1: Interest = $225, Total = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Interest = $225, Total = $525 + $225 = $750
Year 3: Interest = $225, Total = $750 + $225 = $975

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975."
"To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we need to determine half of the total number of white shirts. Since half of 40 white shirts is 40 / 2 = 20, there are 20 white shirts with no collars.

Next, we know that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts: 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars. 

30 (floral shirts with no buttons) - 20 (white shirts with no collars) = 10.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total number of trays the farmer can fill, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray.

Total number of eggs = 900
Number of eggs per tray = 30

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

Total earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm and then add them together.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 x 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y.
So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70

Therefore, there are 70 goats left in the two farms altogether."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

Total amount spent per year = $2640

The average cost of each pair of shoes is $1320."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food with the discount.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

For the red food, we have 3 baskets, but we get $2 off for each basket. So, the discount is 3 * $2 = $6. The cost of the red food after the discount is $18 - $6 = $12. Then, the total cost of the red food is 3 * $12 = $36.

Now, we add the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food: $75 + $36 = $111.

The total cost is $111."
"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first find the number of rooms that is one-half of 90.

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

We know that you are 3 years younger than your brother, so your brother's age is x + 3. You are 2 years older than your sister, so your sister's age is x - 2. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, which is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of your ages is 87, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:

5x + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides:

5x = 78

Divide by 5:

x = 15.6

Since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the answer should be a whole number. Let's re-evaluate the equation.

We can re-evaluate the equation by checking the possible values of x that make the equation true. Since x must be a whole number, we can try different values of x to find the solution.

Let's try x = 15:

15 + (15 + 3) + (15 - 2) + (3(15 + 3) - 1) = 15 + 18 + 13 + (3(18) - 1) = 15 + 18 + 13 + 53 = 99

Since 99 is greater than 87, x = 15 is not the correct solution.

Let's try x = 14:

14 + (14 + 3) + (14 - 2) + (3(14 + 3) - 1) = 14 + 17 + 12 + (3(17) - 1) = 14 + 17 + 12 + 48 = 91

Since 91 is less than 87, x = 14 is not the correct solution.

Let's try x = 16:

16 + (16 + 3) + (16 - 2) + (3(16 + 3) - 1) = 16 + 19 + 14 + (3(19) - 1) = 16 + 19 + 14 + 54 = 103

"To determine the number of packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can divide the total number of students (27) by the number of glue sticks per pack (8). This division operation can be represented as:

27 รท 8 = 3.375

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks. This is because 3.375 is greater than 3, but less than 4. Therefore, we need to round up to 4 packs.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

3.375 = 3 + 0.375

Since 0.375 is greater than 0, we need to add 1 to the quotient (3) to get the correct number of packs.

3 + 1 = 4

Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 4 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day, we need to consider the increase in water flow from the previous day.

On the first day, the river had 4000 gallons of water. On the second day, the water flow doubled, resulting in 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons. 

On the third day, the water flow increased by 6000 gallons, so we add this to the previous day's amount: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

Final answer: 14000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The number of people infected each day is 6 times the number of people infected the previous day.

Day 1: 10 people are initially infected.
Day 2: 10 * 6 = 60 new infections, so the total is 10 + 60 = 70.
Day 3: 70 * 6 = 420 new infections, so the total is 70 + 420 = 490.
Day 4: 490 * 6 = 2940 new infections, so the total is 490 + 2940 = 3430.

Alternatively, we can use the formula for exponential growth: 

A = P(1 + r)^n

where A is the total number of people infected after n days, P is the initial number of people infected (10), r is the growth rate (6), and n is the number of days.

A = 10(1 + 6)^3
A = 10(7)^3
A = 10 * 343
A = 3430

The final answer is 3430."
"To find the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we need to calculate the amount of tips each of them received.

Rafaela received 40 tips of $20 each, so she received 40 * $20 = $800.

Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela, which is 90% of what Rafaela received. 90% of $800 is 0.9 * $800 = $720.

The total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela is $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges. She gave 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so 3 x 2 = 6 oranges were given to the daughters. She also gave 3 oranges to her son. Total oranges given away = 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, subtract the total oranges given away from the total oranges bought:
12 - 9 = 3

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To calculate the total amount raised, we need to determine the total number of slices and then multiply it by the price per slice. 

Paige baked 2 loaves per hour for 5 hours, resulting in a total of 2 * 5 = 10 loaves. Since each loaf is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation:

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get:

x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To calculate the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first determine the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student received 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students can be calculated as follows:

Total burritos given to students = Number of students * Number of burritos per student
Total burritos given to students = 50 * 10
Total burritos given to students = 500

Next, we need to subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos given to the students to find the number of leftover burritos:

Number of leftover burritos = Total burritos given to students - Number of burritos eaten by Mr. George
Number of leftover burritos = 500 - 20
Number of leftover burritos = 480

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 480."
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars.

The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars. Since there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. So, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the total number of cars is 75, the number of yellow cars can be found by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is 23."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the number of books each person has. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as x.

Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, we can express Anne's books as x - 12. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie's books can be represented as (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total cost of the jello, we need to calculate the number of boxes required and then multiply it by the price per box.

First, let's find out how many boxes are needed. We know that one box makes 10 cups, and we need 120 cups in total. To find the number of boxes, we'll divide the total cups needed by the cups per box.

Number of cups needed: 120
Cups per box: 10
Number of boxes needed: 120 รท 10 = 12

Now that we know Greg needs 12 boxes, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes by the price per box.

Number of boxes needed: 12
Price per box: $1.25
Total cost: 12 * $1.25 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the change, we need to subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given. 

The total cost of the phones is 5 phones * $700 per phone, which equals $3500. 

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount given: $4000 - $3500 = $500.

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays 40% of the cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 x $400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide $160 by 4 to find out how much Keenan spends per week. 

$160 / 4 = $40.

The final answer is $40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces he ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of 60 pieces, we can multiply 2/5 by 60.

2/5 * 60 = 24

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. To find this, we can multiply 7/13 by 26.

7/13 * 26 = 14.31 (round down to 14 since you can't eat a fraction of a piece)

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

Final answer: 48"

The total cost is $63.00 + $16.00 = $79.00

The final answer is: $79.00"
"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract it from the amount he has.

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be:
16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find Ella's hourly rate, we need to divide her total earnings by the number of hours she worked. 

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Total hours
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now, we can multiply the hourly rate by the total hours she will work to find her total earnings.

Total earnings = Hourly rate * Total hours
Total earnings = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Total earnings = $132

The final answer is: $132"
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Paul starts with 52 marbles.
2. His friend gives him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.
3. Then, he loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is 20. So, he loses 20 marbles.
4. Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total: 80 - 20 = 60.

Paul has 60 marbles left.

Final Answer: The final answer is 60."
"To calculate Amy's total score, we need to find the points from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. There are 10 questions, and Amy answers 80% of them correctly. Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, we can multiply the number of correct answers by the point value.

Multiple-choice questions: 80% of 10 questions = 0.8 * 10 = 8 points

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. There are 20 questions, and Amy answers 90% of them correctly. Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, we can multiply the number of correct answers by the point value.

True/false questions: 90% of 20 questions = 0.9 * 20 = 18 points

Finally, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. There are 5 questions, and Amy answers 60% of them correctly. Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, we can multiply the number of correct answers by the point value.

Long-answer questions: 60% of 5 questions = 0.6 * 5 = 3 points

Now, let's add up the points from each type of question to find Amy's total score.

Total points = 8 + 18 + 3 = 29 points

The final answer is 29."
"To determine the cost of the chickens, we need to calculate the total cost of the 180 chickens Isaias plans to sell. Since he wants to make a profit of $2000 by selling them at $50 each, we can set up an equation:

Total Revenue = Total Cost + Profit
$50 * 180 = Total Cost + $2000

Simplifying the equation:
$9000 = Total Cost + $2000
Total Cost = $9000 - $2000
Total Cost = $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we need to determine the number of glasses each of them sold. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the boys sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses sold by 3.

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

Now, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales to find the difference:

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so the total cost is:
20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Sarah has the rope for $2 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so she has:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount Sarah has:
$40 - $30 = $10

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

The final answer is: $10"
"To find the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Melanie's present age as 'x'. Since she will be 18 in 10 years, her present age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

We want to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age, which is 3x. We can set up the equation:

x + y = 3x

where y is the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age.

Subtracting x from both sides of the equation, we get:

y = 2x

Since we know Melanie's present age is 8, we can substitute x = 8 into the equation:

y = 2(8)
y = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To calculate the total cost of Kelly's groceries, we need to find the cost of each item and add them up.

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 x 2 = $12.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 x $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 x $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$10 + $12 + $12 + $14 = $48

Since Kelly's budget is $65, we can subtract the total cost from her budget to find out how much money she has left:
$65 - $48 = $17

Therefore, Kelly has $17 left in her budget."
"To find the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert and then divide by 2.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Total runtime of the final concert = 65 minutes
2. Encore time = 15 minutes
3. Runtime of the final concert without encore = 65 - 15 = 50 minutes
4. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we divide the runtime without encore by 2:
   Runtime of the usual concert = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had initially.

Initial number of toys: 200

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas each day, so the total for these two days is 125 + 125 = 250.

On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas, so they make 2 x 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we need to first find the number of microphones that can fit in pairs.

Let's assume the total number of microphones is 50. Since 20% of the microphones won't fit, the number of microphones that won't fit is 20% of 50, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10.

The number of microphones that can fit in pairs is the total number of microphones minus the number of microphones that won't fit: 50 - 10 = 40.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is 40 / 2 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate each group separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds in the bushes are flying overhead, we can multiply the number of birds in the bushes by 2/3.

Number of birds flying overhead = (2/3) * 6
= 2 * 6 / 3
= 12 / 3
= 4

Next, we calculate the total number of birds feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8.

Number of birds feeding = 3 * 8
= 24

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, the number of birds flying overhead, and the number of birds feeding to get the total number of birds.

Total number of birds = 6 + 4 + 24
= 34

The final answer is 34."
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to divide the total number of cookies Lani baked by the number of jars she placed them in.

"To find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals on each type of flower.

The number of petals on an orchid is 5, and there are 5 orchids. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is 5 * 5 = 25.

The number of petals on a daisy is 10, and there are 4 daisies. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is 10 * 4 = 40.

To find the difference, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 - 25 = 15.

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we find the number of indoor plants, which is one-fourth of the total plants. This can be calculated as:

(1/4) ร 100 = 25

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find the remaining plants:

100 - 25 = 75

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. To find the number of outdoor plants, we multiply 75 by 2/3:

(2/3) ร 75 = 50

Now, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants:

75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:

(25 รท 100) ร 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first determine the speed of the thingamabob. Since a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, we can set up an equation:

Let's say the speed of the thingamabob is x. Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x. We know the speed of the whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second, so we can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

So, the thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second.

Now, we know the whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob. To find the speed of the whirligig, we multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the cost of one carrot, we need to first find the total cost of the salad and yogurt. 

The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3. 

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2. 

So, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day."
"To find Mark's new weekly earnings, we need to calculate his hourly wage first. He used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. 

$10 (original wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 (new wage)

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we can multiply his new wage by the total hours he works in a week. There are 5 days in a week, and 8 hours per day, so the total hours worked in a week is 5 * 8 = 40 hours.

$12 (new wage) * 40 hours/week = $480/week

So, Mark now makes $480 per week."
"To find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns, we need to break down the information given. Let's start by using variables to represent the number of times she mowed each lawn. 

Let x be the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, and she mowed his lawn x times, the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is 6x.

We know that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation:

6x = 80

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6:

x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now, we can find the total amount she earned from mowing lawns:
6x = 6 * 13
6x = 78

To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the amount she earned from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
80 - 78 = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know Martin's weight is 55 kg. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.

Next, Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.

Lastly, Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: $\boxed{74}$"
"To calculate John's profit, we need to find the total amount he earns from renting his car and subtract his car payment.

First, let's calculate the total hours he works in a month: 10 hours * 3 hours = 30 hours.

Next, we multiply the total hours by his hourly wage: 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

Now, we subtract his car payment from his total earnings: $750 - $500 = $250.

Therefore, John's profit is $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. We know that Martha bought 5 more notebooks, making her total 7. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha initially, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Joseph had x notebooks. Since Martha had 3 times as many as Joseph, Martha had 3x notebooks. We know Martha had 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, so we can set up the equation:

3x + 5 = 7

To solve for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 7 - 5
3x = 2

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 2 / 3
x = 2/3

Now that we know Joseph had 2/3 notebooks, we can find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 2/3 notebooks. To find the difference, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

7 - 2/3
= 7 - 0.67
= 6.33

So, Martha has 6.33 more notebooks than Joseph.

The final answer is: 6.33"
"To find the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we need to calculate Anis' distance first. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:

Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both of them:
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we can divide the remaining cookies among Susan's 6 nephews.

Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies รท Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 รท 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the difference in pages read by both of them.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. The difference in pages read by Denise and Daniel yesterday is 13 - 10 = 3 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, Denise read 5 more pages than the 13 pages Daniel read yesterday. So, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total pages read by both of them. Yesterday, they read 10 + 13 = 23 pages. Today, Denise read 18 pages. So, the total pages read by both of them is 23 + 18 = 41 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise. Denise read 41 pages and Daniel read 23 pages. So, Denise read 41 - 23 = 18 more pages than Daniel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to calculate the remaining soup after dinner. 

Since Calvin has enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls, and there are four adults, he has 4 bowls of soup. 

Now, we need to subtract the bowls that will be eaten for dinner. There are 4 adults, so 4 bowls will be eaten for dinner. 

4 bowls (total) - 4 bowls (eaten for dinner) = 0 bowls left for lunch.

Since there are 2 children and 0 bowls left, each child will not be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch.

Total cost = $7.50 + $0.50 = $8

Therefore, William spent $8 in total."
"To determine the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for small and large masks separately.

For small masks, we can calculate the total material needed by multiplying the number of small masks by the amount of material required per mask. Since 4 small masks require 2 yards of material, we can set up a proportion to find the material needed for 20 small masks:

(4 small masks / 2 yards) = (20 small masks / x yards)

Cross-multiplying, we get:
4x = 20 * 2
4x = 40
x = 40 / 4
x = 10 yards

For large masks, we can also calculate the total material needed by multiplying the number of large masks by the amount of material required per mask. Since 3 large masks require 2.25 yards of material, we can set up a proportion to find the material needed for 8 large masks:

(3 large masks / 2.25 yards) = (8 large masks / y yards)

Cross-multiplying, we get:
3y = 8 * 2.25
3y = 18
y = 18 / 3
y = 6 yards

Now, we can find the total material needed by adding the material required for small and large masks:
Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets.

"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day (24 hours) and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Now, subtract these hours from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours

Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day."

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to calculate the total marbles he gave away and subtract that from his initial amount.

Dean gave 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since he has 30 marbles, we can calculate 1/5 of 30 as follows:

1/5 * 30 = 6

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie.

He also gave 10 marbles to Donald. Now, we add these marbles together:

6 (given to Jamie) + 10 (given to Donald) = 16

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the total:

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote Adam's current age as 'x'. We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. We can set up the equation:

Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 * Adam's age 4 years ago
60 - 8 = 2 * (x - 4)
52 = 2x - 8

Now, we can solve for 'x' by adding 8 to both sides of the equation:
52 + 8 = 2x
60 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2 to find 'x':
x = 60 / 2
x = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first find the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. 
Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 
So, twice that of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 x 200 = 400 acres. 
Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 
200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical 8-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes and multiply it by his hourly wage.

Colby completes 40 packages per hour (50 - 10 = 40). Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

His hourly wage is $0.20 per package, so his daily earnings can be calculated as 320 * $0.20 = $64.

The final answer is $64."
"To find the total time John spends on sudoku, we need to calculate the time for a normal sudoku and an extreme sudoku.

A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. So, the time for an extreme sudoku is 4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes.

The total time spent on sudoku is the sum of the time for a normal sudoku and an extreme sudoku: 45 minutes + 180 minutes = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can divide the total time by 30 minutes to find the number of bottles he drinks. 

Number of bottles = Total time / 30 minutes = 225 minutes / 30 minutes = 7.5

Since you can't drink half a bottle, we'll round down to 7 bottles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of red balloons as R and the number of yellow balloons as Y. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that the total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58 and the number of red balloons is 20.

We can set up the following equation based on the given information:

2R + 3Y = 58

We are also given that R = 20. We can substitute this value into the equation:

2(20) + 3Y = 58

Simplifying the equation, we get:

40 + 3Y = 58

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:

3Y = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

Y = 6

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total number of miles he drives in 30 days. Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, we can multiply the number of miles driven per day by the number of days:

Total miles = miles/day * days
Total miles = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total miles = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total number of miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs:

Number of tune-ups = Total miles / 1000
Number of tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000
Number of tune-ups = 3

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."

"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine had, we need to calculate the total amount they spent.

They bought a cake for $11 and 1 dozen balloons for $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, they bought 12 balloons. So, the cost of the balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.

The total amount spent so far is $11 (cake) + $6 (balloons) = $17.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $17 (cake and balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $31.

Since they started with the same amount of money, we can set up an equation: x + x = 31, where x is the amount of money each girl received.

Combine like terms: 2x = 31

Divide both sides by 2: x = 31 / 2
x = 15.5

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50.

The final answer is: $15.50"
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges.

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we need to subtract 2 from the total.

14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of students playing volleyball: 2 * 6 = 12

Next, we add the number of students playing soccer: 16 + 22 = 38

Now, we add the number of students playing tennis to the total: 6 + 12 + 38 = 56

Therefore, the total number of students is 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To calculate the total amount of money raised, we need to find the total number of lollipops sold and then multiply it by the profit per lollipop.

Number of lollipops sold = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student
= 30 * 10
= 300 lollipops

Profit per lollipop = Selling price - Cost price
= $0.8 - $0.5
= $0.3

Total profit = Number of lollipops sold * Profit per lollipop
= 300 * $0.3
= $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them together.

First, we know Larry has 3 cats. Then, he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so the number of dogs is 3 * 3 = 9. Next, he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so the number of rabbits is 9 - 2 = 7. 

We also know that Larry has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so the number of fish is 3 * 7 = 21. Additionally, his collection of gerbils is 1/3 the number of fish, so the number of gerbils is 1/3 * 21 = 7.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person eats per day.

Abby eats 2 slices per day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total slices eaten per day (6):

24 รท 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is:

10 years - 5 years = 5 years
Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is:

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we need to divide the total number of cups of mint tea by the number of rows. 

Since Lana has 27 cups in total and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Now, we divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3 rows: 12 รท 3 = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to divide the total number of berries he wants to collect (24) by the number of hours he has to make the trips (8 hours) and then by the number of hours it takes to make a round trip (4 hours).

First, we calculate the number of trips he can make in 8 hours: 8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips.

Since he picks the same number of berries on each trip, we can divide the total number of berries he wants to collect (24) by the number of trips (2) to find the number of berries he can pick per trip.

24 รท 2 = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water used from the tank and subtract it from the initial amount of water in the tank.

The tank is initially filled with half the amount of water in the pool, which is 5000 gallons. Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we can calculate the amount of water remaining after 6 days by subtracting the total amount of water used from the initial amount.

Total water used = 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

Initial amount of water in the tank = 5000 gallons

Amount of water remaining in the tank = Initial amount - Total water used
= 5000 - 3000
= 2000 gallons

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the popcorn and candy he's already purchased.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so his remaining budget is $150 - $8 - $8 = $134.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. Now he has $134 - $10 = $124 left.

To find out how many movies he can see, we'll divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. 

$124 รท $10 = 12.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, he can see 12 movies.

Final answer: 12"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls x 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins x 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs.
So, the total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300

There are 5 days in total (Monday to Friday).
Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 300 / 5
= 60

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. We can use the formula Distance = Speed ร Time to find the distance it traveled:

Distance = 60 miles/hour ร 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. Using the same formula, we can find the distance it traveled:

Distance = 30 miles/hour ร 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:

300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

Therefore, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we can use a simple subtraction method. 

First, let's calculate the total number of toys Sophie initially had: 
Blocks = 31
Stuffed animals = 8
Rings = 9
Total initial toys = 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Since Sophie now has 62 toys, we can find the number of bouncy balls by subtracting the total initial toys from the total number of toys now:
Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys now - Total initial toys
= 62 - 48
= 14

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. We can write an equation to represent this:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's and Jean's age, so we can write another equation:

P = (P + 10) + J

Now, we can simplify the first equation by combining like terms:

2P + J = 90

We can also simplify the second equation by combining like terms:

P = P + 10 + J

Subtract P from both sides:

0 = 10 + J

Subtract 10 from both sides:

-J = 10

Multiply both sides by -1:

J = -10

Now that we have J, we can find P:

P + J = 90
P + (-10) = 90

Subtract -10 from both sides:

P = 100

So, Peter's age is 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of balloons, we can break down the problem into steps. Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so the total number of balloons is 4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons. Adding Maria's 1 balloon, the total becomes 8 + 1 = 9 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is 5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons.

To find the total number of balloons, we add the initial 9 balloons to the additional 15 balloons: 9 + 15 = 24 balloons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of new tables needed, we need to calculate the total number of boxes and then divide it by the number of boxes that can fit on each table.

The charity group has 10 people donating 5 boxes each, which equals 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. They also have 10 boxes already, making a total of 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since each table can hold 2 boxes, we can divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the number of tables needed: 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables.

However, they already have 15 tables. To find the number of new tables required, we subtract the existing tables from the total tables needed: 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables.

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance spat by Zoey, multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 
40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet

To find the total distance spat by Sydney, multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 
35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet

To find the total distance spat by both, add the distances spat by Zoey and Sydney: 
400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, divide the total distance by 2 (since there are 2 people): 
820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To calculate the difference in the total amount of money Fern will make from the two machines, we need to find the total number of widgets produced by each machine and then multiply it by the price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour, and it runs for 24 hours a day. Since there are 30 days in a month, the total number of widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 is:

60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

Each widget sells for $6, so the total money made from the Widgeteer 3000 is:

43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour, and it also runs for 24 hours a day. The total number of widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 is:

45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Each widget sells for $6, so the total money made from the WidgetMaster 9000 is:

32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

To find the difference in the total amount of money Fern will make from the two machines, we subtract the total money from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the total money from the Widgeteer 3000:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To calculate the cost of Cameron's stay, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 12-hour stay and the additional hours.

The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.

Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. 

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 x 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the extended stay is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the extended stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Cameron would save 250 pesos.

Final answer: 250"
"To determine the total amount of hay needed, we need to calculate the amount of hay each animal needs and then add them together.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Since there are 15 goats, the total amount of hay needed for goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. This can be expressed as 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay per sheep. With 12 sheep, the total amount of hay needed for sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for goats and sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{159}$"
"To find out how much John has left after buying the pencils, we need to calculate his earnings first.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends 5 * 10 = 50 dollars.

Now, he has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars left.

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the amount he has left by 25.

100 รท 25 = 4

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 
20 words * 15 letters = 300 letters

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so we add 50 to Craig's total:
300 + 50 = 350

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 350."
"To determine the total number of children participating in the drill, we need to calculate the total number of children by multiplying the number of children in each row by the number of rows.

Since there are 8 children in each row and 7 rows, we can calculate the total number of children as follows:

Total number of children = Number of children in each row * Number of rows
Total number of children = 8 * 7
Total number of children = 56

Therefore, there are 56 children participating in the drill."
"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to calculate the total number of bottles given to the students and subtract that from the total number of bottles the teacher can get.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles the teacher can get is:
9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can get:
900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to add the fixed charge, labor cost, and the cost of parts. 

The labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (2.25) by the hourly rate ($35). 

Labor cost = 2.25 * $35 = $78.75

The total fixed charge is $40. 

The total cost of parts is $60.

The total cost is the sum of the labor cost, the fixed charge, and the cost of parts.

Total cost = Labor cost + Fixed charge + Cost of parts
Total cost = $78.75 + $40 + $60
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find out how much James spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is the number of CDs multiplied by the price per CD. In this case, James bought 10 CDs at $15 each.

Total cost of CDs = 10 * $15
Total cost of CDs = $150

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount.

Discount amount = Total cost of CDs * Discount percentage
Discount amount = $150 * 0.4
Discount amount = $60

Now, James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling them is:

Total amount from selling CDs = Number of CDs sold * Price per CD
Total amount from selling CDs = 5 * $40
Total amount from selling CDs = $200

To find out how much James was out, we subtract the total amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost of the CDs.

Amount James was out = Total cost of CDs - Total amount from selling CDs
Amount James was out = $150 - $200
Amount James was out = -$50

Since James was out $50, he actually lost $50.

Final answer: $50"
"To calculate the total amount Jen will earn from selling her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each crop by its respective price and then add the results together.

First, let's calculate the total value of each type of crop:

Sweet potatoes: 10 * $2 = $20
Carrots: 4 * $1.25 = $5

Now, let's add the values together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Therefore, Jen will earn a total of $34 from selling her root crops.

The final answer is: $34"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the time James spends swimming the first 60% of the distance at 2 miles per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 20 miles * 0.6 / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time James spends resting on the island, which is half the time spent swimming.

Rest time = Swimming time
Rest time = 6 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time James spends swimming the remaining 40% of the distance at half the speed (1 mile per hour).

Distance = 20 miles * 0.4
Distance = 8 miles
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total time James spends on the entire journey.

Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Swimming time
Total time = 6 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 20 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To determine the total number of stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to consider the sequence of events. Initially, she received 15 stickers for participating in class. However, she lost 7 stickers during playtime, which can be represented as 15 - 7. This results in 8 stickers remaining.

Next, her teacher gave her 5 additional stickers for helping her classmates. To find the total number of stickers Jasmine has now, we add these 5 stickers to the 8 remaining stickers: 8 + 5 = 13.

Therefore, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To calculate Cayley's total commission, we need to find the commission for each newspaper and add them together.

For the New York Times, he gets a 10% commission on each copy. Since each copy costs $5, the commission per copy is 10% of $5, which is 0.1 * $5 = $0.50. Since he sold 6 copies, the total commission from the New York Times is 6 * $0.50 = $3.

For the Wall Street Journal, he gets an 8% commission on each copy. Since each copy costs $15, the commission per copy is 8% of $15, which is 0.08 * $15 = $1.20. Since he sold 10 copies, the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is 10 * $1.20 = $12.

The total commission is the sum of the commissions from both newspapers: $3 + $12 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find Leo's age, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. So, Marcus's age is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship: 

M = 0.5L

We know Marcus's age, so we can substitute 21 for M and solve for L:

21 = 0.5L

To isolate L, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.5:

L = 21 / 0.5
L = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the number of points Dinar scored. Let's denote Dinar's score as x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's score can be represented as x + 10. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo's score can be represented as (x + 10) - 20. 

The total points scored by all three team members is 45. We can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + ((x + 10) - 20) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 45

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 55

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 55/3
x = 18.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a point, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more accurate to keep the exact value of x as 55/3.

Now, we can find out how many points Azibo scored:

Azibo's score = (x + 10) - 20
= (55/3 + 10) - 20
= (55/3 + 30/3) - 20
= (85/3) - 20
= (85 - 60)/3
= 25/3

Azibo scored 25/3 points.

25/3"
"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, the number of pages per inch is 2. 

Now, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book: 
2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

Therefore, the book contains 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

There are 60 minutes in an hour. From 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM is 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.
From 12:00 PM to 11:00 PM is 11 hours, which is 11 * 60 = 660 minutes.

Total minutes = 240 + 660 = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we need to divide the total minutes by 15.

Total reports = 900 / 15 = 60

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total minutes she slept and subtract the minutes she woke up early.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. 

8 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 480 minutes

She woke up 5 minutes early, so we subtract 5 minutes from the total minutes she slept:
480 - 5 = 475 minutes

However, she also woke up from 2:15 to 2:38 am, which is 23 minutes. We need to add these minutes to the total:
475 + 23 = 498 minutes

The final answer is: 498"
"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we first need to convert two dozen to a numerical value. Two dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we can calculate 2/3 of 24 cups:
2/3 * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons initially. He gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so he is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons, so the total number of utensils he has remaining is:
24 + 10 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to calculate the initial number of occupied beds and then subtract the number of patients admitted.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of them are occupied. To find 1/5 of 1000, we can multiply 1000 by 1/5.

1/5 ร 1000 = 1000 ร 1/5 = 200

So, there are 200 occupied beds initially. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 14 days is:

50 ร 14 = 700

Now, we subtract the number of patients admitted from the initial number of occupied beds to find the number of unoccupied beds:

1000 - 200 = 800 (initial occupied beds)
800 - 700 = 100

However, we need to consider that the hospital's capacity is 1000 beds, and 1/5 of them are occupied. The correct calculation for the initial number of occupied beds is 200. The correct number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:

1000 - 200 = 800

The correct answer is 800."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many emails are not work emails. We know that Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is:

Non-work emails per day = Total emails per day - Work emails per day
Non-work emails per day = 16 - 7
Non-work emails per day = 9

Now, we need to find out how many of the non-work emails are to family. Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family, so we can calculate this as:

Emails to family per day = (2/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to family per day = (2/3) * 9
Emails to family per day = 6

Finally, we need to find out how many of the non-work emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of the non-work emails are to her boyfriend, so we can calculate this as:

Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * 9
Emails to boyfriend per day = 3

"To find Shawna's age, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. 

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can multiply Shawna's age by 5 to find her father's age.

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years

The final answer is 45."
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

20% of 48 can be calculated as 0.20 * 48 = 9.6. 

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{38.4}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason's balls = 2x. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan's balls = 2(2x) = 4x.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation: 2x = 2. Solving for x, we get x = 1.

Now that we know Jeffrey carried 1 ball, we can find the total number of balls by adding the balls carried by each boy: Total balls = Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls + Jordan's balls = 2x + x + 4x = 7x.

Substituting x = 1, we get Total balls = 7(1) = 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of holes dug by the pirates on the fourth day. Let's break it down step by step:

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 6 holes on the third day (since 2 holes were filled in). The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Total holes by the end of the fourth day = 4 * Total holes by the end of the third day
116 = 4 * 29

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to subtract the total holes dug by the end of the third day from the total holes by the end of the fourth day:

Holes dug on the fourth day = Total holes by the end of the fourth day - Total holes by the end of the third day
= 116 - 29
= 87

Therefore, the pirates dug 87 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The final answer is: $\boxed{87}$"
"To find the total number of corn chips, we can start by determining how many corn chips Collins got. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than Amora and Lainey, and Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, we can calculate Collins' share as follows:

Collins' share = Amora's share + 15
Collins' share = 70 + 15
Collins' share = 85

Now, we can add the corn chips of all three to find the total number of corn chips:

Total corn chips = Amora's share + Lainey's share + Collins' share
Total corn chips = 70 + 70 + 85
Total corn chips = 225

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

The cost of the supplies is $400. To find 50% of this amount, we multiply $400 by 0.5.

50% of $400 = 0.5 x $400 = $200

Now, we add the 50% of the cost of the supplies to the cost of the supplies.

Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of the cost of supplies
= $400 + $200
= $600

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of Pokรฉmon caught by each person. Let's denote the number of Pokรฉmon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that:
1. The total number of Pokรฉmon caught is 339: A + S + X = 339
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: X = S + 5
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the value of X from equation 2 into equation 1:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the value of S from equation 3 into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

Total minutes per episode = 20
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the total minutes per episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the first direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the second direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the third direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, the net distance traveled south is:
Net Distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
Net Distance = 264 miles

The bird traveled a total of 264 miles south, so the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 264 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{264}$"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to add the brownies she made for herself, the ones she received at the office party, and the ones her friends brought to her home.

She made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we can write this as 12.

She received 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies at the office party. To find the value of 1/2 a dozen, we multiply 1/2 by 12. This can be written as (1/2) ร 12 = 6.

Her friends brought 4 dozen (48) brownies to her home. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we can write this as 4 ร 12 = 48.

Total brownies = 12 + 6 + 48
= 12 + 6 + 48
= 66

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten. To find the value of 1 1/2 a dozen, we multiply 1 1/2 by 12. This can be written as (1 1/2) ร 12 = (1.5) ร 12 = 18.

Brownies left over = Total brownies - Brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 66 - 18
= 48

Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his age is 2 x 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of Nani (8), his brother (16), and his sister (6). 
The total age of the family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The cost of the first two phones is 2 x $600 = $1200.

The cost of the remaining phones (3 phones) is 3 x $300 (half of $600) = $900.

The total cost is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team and Carlton's team.

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, we can represent this as an equation: 

Let C = number of players in Carlton's team
Let Z = number of players in Zeke's team

We know that Z = C + 7

We are given that Carlton's team has 13 players, so C = 13

Now, we can substitute C = 13 into the equation Z = C + 7 to find the number of players in Zeke's team:
Z = 13 + 7
Z = 20

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 
Total number of players = C + Z
Total number of players = 13 + 20
Total number of players = 33

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence.

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to calculate the total number of oranges she had initially, then subtract the ones she kept and gave away.

First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially: 12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges.

Next, we need to calculate the number of oranges she gave to her mom and sister: 2 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 40 oranges.

Since she kept 1/4 of the oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges she kept: 1/4 * 240 oranges = 60 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the oranges she gave away and kept from the total: 240 - 40 - 60 = 140 oranges.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 140 oranges.

"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in the USA and then add 4 to it.

The number of states in the USA is 50.

Half of 50 is 25. 
India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India: 
50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and subtract the amount he has saved.

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39. Since Tyler has saved $14, we can find the amount he still needs by subtracting the saved amount from the total cost.

Amount needed = Total cost of books - Amount saved
= $39 - $14
= $25

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can divide the amount needed by his hourly wage to find the number of hours he needs to work.

Number of hours = Amount needed / Hourly wage
= $25 / $5
= 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we need to first determine the number of cherries each person has.

We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more cherries than Richard. So, we can set up an equation to find Richard's cherries:

Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the total number of cherries from the total number of cherries (60) and subtracting Robert's and Richard's cherries:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Robert's cherries - Richard's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 30 - 20
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much Sunny earned from selling gingerbread and apple pie, we need to calculate the total earnings for each day and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings for Saturday:

- Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6 per box = $60
- Apple pie: Since we don't know the exact number of apple pies sold on Saturday, we'll represent it as x. However, we do know that Sunny sold 4 fewer apple pies on Sunday than on Saturday. So, the number of apple pies sold on Sunday is x - 4.

Now, let's calculate the earnings for Sunday:

- Gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6 per box = $90
- Apple pie: (x - 4) boxes * $15 per box

Since we know that Sunny sold 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, we can set up an equation to find the value of x (the number of apple pies sold on Saturday):

15 = 10 + 5
10 = 10

This equation is true, so we can use the information that Sunny sold 4 fewer apple pies on Sunday than on Saturday to find the number of apple pies sold on Saturday:

x - 4 = 6
x = 10

Now that we know the number of apple pies sold on Saturday, we can calculate the total earnings for each day:

- Saturday: $60 (gingerbread) + $60 (apple pie) = $120
- Sunday: $90 (gingerbread) + $90 (apple pie) = $180

Total earnings for two days: $120 + $180 = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need, we can multiply the number of hours she'll be outside by the rate at which she reappplies sunscreen.

She'll be outside for 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total number of hours is:

$100 - $40 = $60

So, the red car costs $60.

The blue car costs $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the given information.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so we can set up the equation: 24 = D/2.

To solve for D, we can multiply both sides by 2, which gives us D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so we can set up the equation: 24 = 2B.

To solve for B, we can divide both sides by 2, which gives us B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12.

The sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne had, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Her mother gave her 20 beads.
2. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Therefore, Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day.

First, let's calculate the amount he caught on Friday. Since he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, we multiply 3 pounds by 4:

3 pounds * 4 = 12 pounds

Then, we calculate the amount he caught on Saturday. Since he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, we divide 12 pounds by 2:

12 pounds / 2 = 6 pounds

Now, we add up the amount he caught each day to find the total:

3 pounds + 12 pounds + 6 pounds = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:

21 pounds / 3 = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders/band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To find the average size of the shoes, we need to add the sizes of Charlie's and Sophie's boots and divide by 2.

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding the sizes together and dividing by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes is 15."
"To determine the total cost of the flowers, we need to calculate the number of additional flowers Pat needs to buy and then multiply that by the cost per flower.

First, let's find out how many flowers Pat can fit in her flower bed. Since each flower is 12 inches wide and she needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant, the total space required for each flower and the space between them is 12 + 18 = 30 inches. 

Now, we can divide the total length of the bed (in inches) by the space required for each flower and the space between them: 1332 รท 30 = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we'll round down to 44 flowers. 

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 27 * 6 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to calculate his daily pretzel consumption and then multiply it by 7.

Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, who eats 18 pretzels a day. So, we can find Edgar's brother's daily pretzel consumption by multiplying Edgar's daily consumption by 1/2.

Daily pretzels Edgar's brother eats = 18 * 1/2
= 18 * 0.5
= 9

Now, we multiply his daily pretzel consumption by 7 to find out how many pretzels he eats in a week.

Pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week = 9 * 7
= 63

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is: 63"

"To determine the number of roses Artemis can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, subtract the total amount of soil used from the total amount of soil they bought:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses.

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside for shoes each month and then divide that by the cost of a pair.

Jessica makes $2,000 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000, we multiply $2,000 by 0.25.

$2,000 * 0.25 = $500

Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000, we can divide the amount she sets aside each month by the cost of a pair to find out how many pairs she can buy.

$500 รท $1,000 = 0.5

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can multiply the number of pairs she can buy per month by 12 to find the total number of pairs she can buy in a year.

0.5 pairs/month * 12 months = 6 pairs/year

The final answer is 6."
"To find the time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the task into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can divide the total number of shrimp by the rate:

Time to peel = Total shrimp / Rate
Time to peel = 90 / 6
Time to peel = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Since Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide the total number of shrimp by the rate:

Time to cook = Total shrimp / Rate
Time to cook = 90 / 30
Time to cook = 3 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and cook to get the total time:

Total time = Time to peel + Time to cook
Total time = 15 + 3
Total time = 18 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 18 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

Final answer: 18"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. The room will warm up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour with no air conditioner running. 

First, let's calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room 2 degrees per hour. So, the room was cooled 3 x 2 = 6 degrees. Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room an additional 4 x 3 = 12 degrees. The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

Since the room will warm up at 2 degrees per hour with no air conditioner running, and the air conditioner was off for 2 hours, the room warmed up 2 x 2 = 4 degrees.

The final temperature is the starting temperature minus the total cooling effect plus the warming effect: Final temperature = Starting temperature - 18 + 4 = Starting temperature - 14.

The question asks how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is. Since the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature, the answer is 14 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time. Let's denote the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as x. 

Since Bill saw the comet 75 years after his dad, we can set up the equation: x + 30 = 90. Solving for x, we get x = 60 years.

Now, we need to find Bill's age when his dad saw the comet. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can find the number of times it has orbited in 60 years by dividing 60 by 75, which is 0.8 (or 4/5). 

Since the comet orbits the sun 4/5 of the time, it will take 4/5 of the total time for the comet to return. The total time for the comet to return is 75 years, so the time for the comet to return is 4/5 * 75 = 60 years.

Since Bill saw the comet 60 years after his dad, and the comet returns every 75 years, we can find the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet by subtracting 60 from 75, which is 15 years.

Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, and 15 years have passed since then, we can find Bill's age when his dad saw the comet by adding 15 to 30, which is 45 years.

The final answer is 45."
"To calculate the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider the frequency of each type of check.

Buford writes 1 check per month for the electric bill and the gas bill, which totals 2 checks per month. He also writes 2 checks per month to the church. Additionally, he writes 4 checks per year to the pest and lawn service.

First, let's calculate the total number of checks per month: 2 (electric and gas) + 2 (church) = 4 checks per month.

Now, we multiply the total number of checks per month by 12 to get the total number of checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year.

Therefore, Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane makes 3/4 of its flights to Greece, so it makes 3/4 * 88 = 66 flights to Greece.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the first plane makes 88 - 66 = 22 flights to France and Germany.

Since the flights to France and Germany are split equally, the first plane makes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France.

The first plane makes 11 flights to France."
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds, which is equivalent to 20/60 = 1/3 of a minute.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds, which is equivalent to 40/60 = 2/3 of a minute.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds, which is equivalent to 60/60 = 1 minute.

Now, let's add the lengths of their howls together: 1/3 + 2/3 + 1 = 4/3 minutes.

To convert the total time from a fraction to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator: 4 รท 3 = 1.33 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.33}$"
"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract it from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 x $6 = $12. The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Now, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we can use the information given in the problem. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.

We know that the total age of the children is 20, and we can express this as an equation: H + W + 3 + 4 = 20, since Akbar's age is 3 and Alessandro's age is 4.

We also know that Helene is twice the average age of the group. The average age is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5. Since Helene is twice the average age, we can express this as H = 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we can substitute H = 10 into the equation H + W + 3 + 4 = 20 to solve for W:

10 + W + 3 + 4 = 20

Combine like terms:

17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:

W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far. He collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from a fund he set up online. So, the total amount collected is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates, we need to find out how much Walter and his friend have donated in total. Walter has donated $2000, and his friend is going to give him $200. So, the total amount donated by Walter and his friend is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, we can calculate the amount Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates, the amount he will contribute is 3 * $2200 = $6600.

However, the question asks for the amount Walter's lawyer is going to contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200. So, we need to subtract $200 from the total amount Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. The final amount Walter's lawyer is going to contribute is $6600 - $200 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

Total number of cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies
Half of the cookies = 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church.

Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

The final answer is 50."
"To divide a watermelon among a family of 6, where 2 adults and 4 kids are to get slices that are in a 2:1 ratio, we can start by assuming the number of slices for the kids is x. Since each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, the number of slices for the adults is 2x.

The total number of slices is the sum of the slices for the kids and the adults, which is x + 2x = 3x. Since there are 6 people in total, we can set up the equation 3x = 6.

Solving for x, we get x = 2. This means the kids get 2 slices, and the adults get 2x = 4 slices.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we divide the number of slices for the adults (4) by the total number of slices (6) and multiply by 100:

(4/6) * 100 = 66.67%

So, each adult gets approximately 66.67% of the watermelon.

The final answer is 66.67."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the tasks.

The total time is the sum of the time to make the cake batter, bake the cake, cool the cake, and frost the cake. 

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time to find the latest start time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan can start making the cake at 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: 2:00 pm"
"To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars sold by the total number of boxes sold. 

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. We know that Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so the total number of boxes sold is 3.5 + 4.5 = 8.

The total number of chocolate bars sold is 64. We can set up the equation:

3.5x + 4.5x = 64

Combine like terms:

8x = 64

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 64 / 8

x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

Final answer: 8"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio is $25 per session, and it's rented 3 days a week. So, the weekly cost of renting the studio is $25 * 3 = $75. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of renting the studio is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students. So, the weekly cost of students' lessons is $1.50 * 3 * 10 = $45. The monthly cost of students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total cost of renting the studio and students' lessons per month is $300 (renting) + $180 (students' lessons) = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

Let's start by finding the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha.

For Peter, we have 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes. To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we can divide 64 by 4:

64 รท 4 = 16

For Martha, we have 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes. To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we can divide 56 by 7:

56 รท 7 = 8

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter and Martha. To do this, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter:

16 - 8 = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = (3/5) * 50
= 3 * 10
= 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4
= 120

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12
= 1440

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines:
50 (initial population) + 1440 (new porcupines) = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool.

Volume = Length x Width x Depth
Volume = 14 x 25 x 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll do that next.

Total gallons = Volume x 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 x 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Total gallons x Cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 x 0.10
Cost = $826

The cost to fill the pool is $826."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first determine the number of blue sticks and yellow sticks.

The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks. Since there are 9 red sticks, the number of blue sticks can be calculated as:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
= 9 + 5
= 14

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks can be calculated as:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
= 14 - 3
= 11

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
= 9 + 14 + 11
= 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply her speed by the time she traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find the difference: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The difference in distance traveled is 230 miles."
"To find the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old, which is 3000 / 2 = 1500 students. One-fourth of these students are male, so the number of male students over 16 is 1500 / 4 = 375. To find the number of female students over 16, we subtract the number of male students from the total number of students over 16: 1500 - 375 = 1125.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which is also 1500 students. One-half of these students are male, so the number of male students under 16 is 1500 / 2 = 750. To find the number of female students under 16, we subtract the number of male students from the total number of students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to find the total number of female students: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the number of laps each person can run.

We know that Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. Since Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, we can calculate Trey's laps as 10 + 4 = 14.

Next, we're told that Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey. To find Shaelyn's laps, we divide Trey's laps by 2: 14 รท 2 = 7.

Lastly, Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn. So, we subtract 2 from Shaelyn's laps: 7 - 2 = 5.

To determine how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining amount of water is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the initial charge of the power bank. Let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:

x - (9% * 5) = x - 45%

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:

x - 45% - (7% * 3) = x - 45% - 21%
x - 66% = 28%

To find the value of x, we can add 66% to both sides:

x = 28% + 66%
x = 94%

So, the initial charge of the power bank was 94%.

The final answer is: 94"
"To calculate how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to find 20% of the cost of the car.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 รท $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours รท 40 hours/week = 2 weeks

Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

He bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He bought 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total amount spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar has $10 and spent $10.25 on other fruits, he actually doesn't have enough money to buy any plums. However, we can calculate how many plums he can buy with the money he has left.

Since he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25, but we can't spend a negative amount, we'll consider the actual amount he has left, which is $0. He can't buy any plums.

Final answer: $0"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we need to first determine the total number of pieces given away. Since there are 15 packs in total, and Anne kept 2 packs, the number of packs given away is 15 - 2 = 13.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces given away is 13 * 60 = 780.

Now, we divide the total number of pieces given away by 10 to find out how many pieces each friend received:

780 รท 10 = 78

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we need to find the price increase each year and add it to the previous year's price.

Year 1: 
The price increase is 5% of the original price, which is 0.05 * $120 = $6. The new price is $120 + $6 = $126.

Year 2: 
The price increase is 5% of $126, which is 0.05 * $126 = $6.30. The new price is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

Year 3: 
The price increase is 5% of $132.30, which is 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615. The new price is $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

Final answer: $139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album.

72 รท 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the number of selfies.

3 x 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the number of portraits.

2 x 9 = 18

The total number of portraits and selfies is 27 + 18 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the total time James spends reading, we can use a simple proportion. Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can set up a proportion to find the time it takes him to read 18 pages.

Let's denote the time it takes to read 18 pages as x. We can set up the proportion as follows:

3 pages / 10 minutes = 18 pages / x minutes

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3x = 18 * 10
3x = 180
x = 180 / 3
x = 60

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to follow the steps below:

The hotel initially had 100 guests. Then, 24 guests checked out early, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests. After that, 15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in. The number of guests remaining is 61 + 30 = 91.

Finally, 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."

John has 22 bananas."
"To find the number of easy questions, we need to calculate 40% of 60. 

40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we subtract the easy questions from the total and divide by 2.

60 - 24 = 36
36 / 2 = 18

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is:
24 * 0.75 = 18

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is:
18 * 0.5 = 9

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we add the points from easy and average/difficult questions:
18 + 9 = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's break it down step by step:

Let's say the price of a large stuffed animal is x. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x.

We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * 4 = $12.

Let's say Teresa sold 's' number of large stuffed animals and '2s' number of small stuffed animals. The total amount earned from the sales is $120, so we can set up the equation: 12s + 4(2s) = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12s + 8s = 120
Combining like terms, we get: 20s = 120

Dividing both sides by 20, we get: s = 6

Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2s = 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

Total sandwiches eaten per day = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11

Total sandwiches eaten in a week = 11 * 7 = 77

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 x $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 x $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them a total of 2 x $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."

The friends found 60 eggs."
"To calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we need to consider the increased efficiency of the steel pickaxe.

First, we know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day. 

Since a steel pickaxe provides 50% more efficiency than an iron pickaxe, we can calculate the daily ore mined by a dwarf with a steel pickaxe as 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds.

With 40 dwarves, the total amount of ore mined per day with steel pickaxes is 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

To find the total amount of ore mined in a month, we multiply this by 30 days: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the concept of proportionality. Since the prices are proportional, we can set up a ratio between the number of sandwiches and the price for the first two packages.

Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as x. We can set up the following proportion:

2 sandwiches / $3 = 4 sandwiches / $6 = 8 sandwiches / x

We can simplify the proportion by dividing both sides of the first two ratios:

2 / 3 = 4 / 6

Cross-multiplying, we get:

6 * 2 = 3 * 4
12 = 12

This shows that the proportion is true, and we can use it to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches.

Now, we can set up a proportion using the first two packages:

2 / 3 = 8 / x

Cross-multiplying, we get:

2x = 3 * 8
2x = 24

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 24 / 2
x = 12

Therefore, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

Final answer: $12"
"To calculate the monthly payment, we need to find 10% of the remaining amount Tom owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

The remaining amount owed is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

To find 10% of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 0.10.

Monthly payment = 0.10 x $2000
Monthly payment = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons remaining after each event.

First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst: 
40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.

The number of red balloons remaining is: 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, let's calculate the number of yellow balloons released: 
Half of 12 yellow balloons = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released.

The number of yellow balloons remaining is: 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Now, let's calculate the number of blue balloons added: 
75% of 8 blue balloons = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.

The total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is: 15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 27 balloons.

The final answer is 27."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario:

- The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
- The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 40% chance of getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
- The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

Now, we add up the probabilities of these scenarios: 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.8

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.8 * 100 = 80%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 80%.

Final answer: $\boxed{80\%}$"

Total capacity = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 รท 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we can start by finding the number of medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat. Since it takes 75 large beans to fill him up and he can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, we can calculate the number of medium beans as follows:

Medium beans = 2 * Large beans
Medium beans = 2 * 75
Medium beans = 150

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. To find the number of small beans Grandpa can eat, we can divide the number of medium beans by 3:

Small beans = Medium beans / 3
Small beans = 150 / 3
Small beans = 50

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans."
"To calculate Melissa's hourly wage after expenses, we need to first find her total daily income and then subtract her parking expenses. 

Daily income: $15 per day
Parking expenses: $3 per day
Total daily income after expenses: $15 - $3 = $12 per day

Since she worked for 3 days, her total income after expenses is $12 * 3 = $36.

Now, let's calculate her hourly wage:
$36 รท 18 hours = $2 per hour

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each can be calculated using the formula: 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.

The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each can also be calculated using the formula: 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Therefore, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars.

The final answer is: $66"
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we can divide the width of the driveway by 3:

24 feet รท 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, the total time it will take him to set off all the soda fountains is:

7 moves ร 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains."
"To find the total number of packs, we need to multiply the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes.

Number of apples in one box = 40
Number of boxes = 2

Total number of apples = 40 * 2 = 80

Since each pack has 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs.

Number of packs = 80 รท 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

Final answer: 10"
"To calculate the total cost of the cheese, we need to multiply the weight of each type of cheese by its respective price and then add the results.

The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and Amor buys 2 pounds, so the total cost of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.

The price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and Amor buys 3 pounds, so the total cost of Mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost of cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10

Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To calculate the total amount of money lost from not working while in school, we need to multiply the number of years in school by the annual income.

Number of years in school: 4 years
Annual income before college: $25,000
Annual income after college: $75,000 (triple the original income)

Total amount lost from not working: 4 years * $25,000 = $100,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost from not working:

Total amount of loans: 4 years * $50,000 = $200,000
Total amount to earn: $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new annual income:

$300,000 รท $75,000 = 4 years

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To calculate the total amount of fabric needed, we need to find the area of the comforter. The comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.

First, we need to find the dimensions of the comforter. Since the comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of the comforter will be:
- Length: 6 + 2 = 8 feet
- Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of the comforter:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 8 x 10
Area = 80 square feet

Since the comforter is made of two pieces, we need to multiply the area by 2:
Total fabric needed = 2 x 80
Total fabric needed = 160 square feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery:
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85
17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery:
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204
5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

The final answer is: $\boxed{736}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the catering, we need to find the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

"To find the average amount lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.
In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
So, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11.
In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Total amount lost = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

Average amount lost = Total amount lost / Number of races
= $21.5 / 3
= $7.17

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height is 4 feet 3 inches, which can be converted to just inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot + 3 inches = 51 inches.

Cole's new height is 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

Now, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height to find the difference:
52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find the amount the first person took, let's break down the problem. We know that the total amount is $1920. The second person took $80 more than the first person, and the third person took twice what the second person took.

Let's denote the amount the first person took as x. Then, the second person took x + 80, and the third person took 2(x + 80).

The sum of their shares should equal the total amount: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: 4x + 160 = 1920.

Subtract 160 from both sides: 4x = 1760.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 440.

So, the first person took $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the total hours worked by the team, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team:
3 weeks = 3 * 7 days = 21 days
3/8 of a day = 21 * 3/8 = 7.875 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply 7.875 days by 24 hours:
7.875 * 24 = 189 hours

Now, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters (4):
189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. Since he retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We can set up the equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. We can use the formula for depreciation:

Price = Initial Price * (1 - Depreciation Rate)^Number of Years

In this case, the initial price is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% or 0.21, and the number of years is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

Price in 2010 = $20,000 * (1 - 0.21)^3
Price in 2010 = $20,000 * (0.79)^3
Price in 2010 = $20,000 * 0.631519
Price in 2010 = $12,630.38

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $12,630.38.

12,630.38"
"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to calculate the number of books written in English and German first.

Number of English books = 50 * 0.5 = 25
Number of German books = 50 * 0.1 = 5

Total number of English and German books = 25 + 5 = 30

Since the total number of books is 50, the number of Spanish books can be found by subtracting the total number of English and German books from the total number of books.

Number of Spanish books = Total number of books - Total number of English and German books
= 50 - 30
= 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven (325 kilometers) from the total distance (1955 kilometers).

Distance remaining = Total distance - Distance driven

= 1630 km

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

Final answer: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of cups she drinks in that time period and then convert it to gallons.

Since Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day, we can multiply this rate by the number of days: 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.

Now, we know that there are 16 cups in a gallon. To find out how many gallons 240 cups is, we can divide 240 by 16: 240 cups รท 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events:

Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, so the total becomes 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people board the train. So, the total becomes 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train, so the total becomes 190 - 80 = 110.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the running shorts. Since they cost $5 more than the tank top, and the tank top costs $10, the running shorts will cost $10 + $5 = $15.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the tennis shoes. The original price is $48, but they are on sale for half price. To find the sale price, we'll divide the original price by 2: $48 รท 2 = $24.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the athletic socks. The original price is $8, and Alison has a coupon for $2 off. So, the cost of the socks will be $8 - $2 = $6.

Finally, let's add the costs together: $10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To calculate the total cost of the tiles, we need to find the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. 

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet. To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area by the area of each tile: 

200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile to find the total cost:
200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 = 0.6 x $120 = $72

The increased cost is $72. To find the total cost, we add the increased cost to the normal cost:

$120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this amount for a month, we need to multiply it by 12 to find the yearly cost:

$192 x 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To calculate the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to consider the number of loads for each type of bed and the frequency of washing.

Let's break it down:

- Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king bed. He washes 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time.
- Since the laundry machine can only handle 3 sets at a time, we need to divide the total number of loads by 3 to find the number of loads per week.
- For twin beds: 4 beds * 52 weeks = 208 twin loads. Since he can wash 2 twin sets at a time, we divide by 2: 208 / 2 = 104 twin loads per year.
- For king beds: 1 bed * 52 weeks = 52 king loads. Since he can wash 1 king set at a time, we don't need to divide: 52 king loads per year.

Now, we add the total number of loads per year: 104 twin loads + 52 king loads = 156 loads per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on both Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. Since this is a constant number, we can multiply it by the number of weeks to find the total number of movies watched on Saturdays in 4 weeks.

Total movies watched on Saturday in 4 weeks = 4 movies/week * 4 weeks = 16 movies

On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies. Again, we can multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total number of movies watched on Sundays in 4 weeks.

Total movies watched on Sunday in 4 weeks = 2 movies/week * 4 weeks = 8 movies

To find the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks, we add the total number of movies watched on Saturdays and Sundays.

Total movies watched in 4 weeks = 16 + 8 = 24 movies

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find the total number of stickers Leo has, we need to calculate the stickers he had two years ago, last year, and this year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers. This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, we add the stickers from the three years: 100 + 150 + 100 = 350 stickers.

The total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is 350."
"To determine how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount fed per day (60 grams).

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to represent the number of slices each person ate. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as x. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can represent Becky's slices as x + 3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so we can represent Silvia's slices as 2x.

We know that the total number of slices is 4 pizzas with 8 slices each, so the total number of slices is 4 * 8 = 32. We can set up an equation to represent the total number of slices eaten:

x + (x + 3) + 2x = 32

Combine like terms:
4x + 3 = 32

Subtract 3 from both sides:
4x = 29

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 7.25

Since we can't have a fraction of a slice, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can use the exact value of x to find the total number of slices eaten.

Becky's slices = x + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10
Jake's slices = x = 7
Silvia's slices = 2x = 2 * 7 = 14

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote Donovan's part as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as x + 18.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:

Betsy's part = x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58

The final answer is 58."
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to break down the costs of each service.

The doctor charges $200 for the cast. For the visit, the cost is $300 per hour, and since the visit is 30 minutes, we need to calculate the cost for half an hour. This is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is $4 per pill, and Hannah needs 30 pills. So, the total cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The doctor also charges $6 per hour for parking, and the minimum parking time is 2 hours. Therefore, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add the costs together: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to calculate the total number of emails he responds to per day and then multiply it by 5.

James receives 80 emails per day, and 20% of those don't require a response. To find the number of emails that require a response, we can calculate 20% of 80:

20% of 80 = 0.2 * 80 = 16

Since 16 emails don't require a response, the number of emails that require a response is:

80 - 16 = 64

Now, we multiply the number of emails James responds to per day (64) by 5 to find the total number of emails he responds to in a 5-day work week:

64 * 5 = 320

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."

- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Total number of classes = 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25

To calculate the total, we can use the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Add 32 and 64: 32 + 64 = 96
2. Add 96 to 96: 96 + 96 = 192
3. Add 30 to 192: 192 + 30 = 222

"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To calculate the total cost of postage, we need to find the cost of mailing small and big coupons separately and then add them together.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = $7.00.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = $21.00.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Sidney initially ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means he ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches. 

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so the number of sub sandwiches left is 7 - 4 = 3.

After that, Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, making the total number of sub sandwiches 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, and each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total amount of fertiliser, we multiply the number of trucks by the amount each truck carried.

Total fertiliser = Number of trucks * Amount per truck
Total fertiliser = 20 trucks * 20 tons/truck
Total fertiliser = 400 tons

Now, we are told that a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertiliser. To find the number of trucks that could not deliver, we calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks.

Number of trucks that could not deliver = 1/4 * 20 trucks
Number of trucks that could not deliver = 5 trucks

Since each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is:
Amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered = Number of trucks that could not deliver * Amount per truck
Amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered = 5 trucks * 20 tons/truck
Amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered = 100 tons

To find the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we subtract the amount that could not be delivered from the total amount.

Amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers = Total fertiliser - Amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered
Amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers = 400 tons - 100 tons
Amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers = 300 tons

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To calculate the total cost of the butter, we need to determine the total amount of butter Dennis needs and then apply the discount.

Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen. So, he needs 6 x 1 = 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds.

To find the total cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) into groups of 2 pounds.

6 pounds / 2 pounds per group = 3 groups

Since each group costs 1.5 pounds, the total cost will be:
3 groups x 1.5 pounds per group = 4.5 pounds

Since the butter costs $4.00 a pound, the total cost will be:
4.5 pounds x $4.00 per pound = $18.00

The final answer is: $18.00"

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially, we need to find the total amount of money they had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is $60 + $60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. To find 1/4 of $60, we can multiply 60 by 1/4 or divide 60 by 4.

60 รท 4 = 15

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. To find 1/3 of $60, we can multiply 60 by 1/3 or divide 60 by 3.

60 รท 3 = 20

The total amount of money they spent is 15 + 20 = 35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$120 - $35 = $85

The two of them have $85 left."
"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first find out how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is:
10 * 7 = 70 bananas
14 * 7 = 98 bananas

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas, which is:
315 - 168 = 147 bananas

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total bananas eaten by the third monkey by 7:
147 รท 7 = 21 bananas per day.

The final answer is 21."
"To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the number of pieces he placed in the first half of the puzzle and the number of pieces he placed in the second puzzle.

Since Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, he placed 250 pieces.

In the second puzzle, he finished 500 pieces.

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then subtract that from the amount of money she has.

The cost of 15 roses is $30. Since a dozen roses cost $15, we can also calculate the cost of 15 roses as follows:
15 roses / 12 = 1.25 dozen
1.25 dozen * $15 per dozen = $18.75

Since Jenny has $25, we need to subtract the cost of the roses from the amount of money she has:
$25 - $18.75 = $6.25

Since she can only pay with quarters, we need to convert the remaining amount to quarters:
$6.25 / $0.25 = 25 quarters

Jenny will leave 25 quarters with her."
"To calculate the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its price and then add the results together.

First, let's calculate the total sales from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33.

Next, we'll calculate the total sales from burger platters: 9 platters * $11 = $99.

Lastly, we'll calculate the total sales from sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 = $30.

Now, let's add the total sales from each item together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time between each train's arrival and departure.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time between the first train's arrival and departure is 20 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the time between the second train's arrival and departure is 5 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes after the second train's arrival. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so the time between the third train's arrival and departure is 0 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 20 minutes after the third train's arrival. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:

Total waiting time = 20 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 130 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{130}$"
"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12).

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the original price of the watch, we need to determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought it. Since he bought it at 75% of its original price, we can set up the equation:

Original price * 0.75 = 2000

To find the original price, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

Original price = 2000 / 0.75
Original price = 2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * 2666.67 = 3200.

The original price was 2666.67, and the sale price was 3200. The discount is 3200 - 2666.67 = 533.33.

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:

(533.33 / 2666.67) * 100 = 20%

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of jellyfish created per hour by one spring and then multiply it by the number of springs and the number of hours.

Since a new jellyfish is created every second, we can assume that the rate of jellyfish creation is 1 jellyfish per second.

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame.

So, the number of jellyfish created per hour by one spring is 1 jellyfish/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 jellyfish/hour.

Now, if 5 springs are working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created per hour is 5 * 3600 jellyfish/hour = 18,000 jellyfish/hour.

In 4 hours, the total number of jellyfish created is 18,000 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72,000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72000}$"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it.

Binkie's score: 90
Twice Binkie's score: 2 * 90 = 180
Frankie's score: 180 + 15 = 195

Frankie's score is 195."
"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the time it took him to walk to the store and then back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took him to walk to the store. Since he walked halfway, that's 2 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 0.5 hours

Since he walked back home, the total distance is 2 miles (to the store) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

The total time it took James to reach the store is 0.5 hours (to the store) + 1 hour (back home) = 1.5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.5}$"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas individually and then compare it to the cost of buying 10 bunches.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches individually. Since each banana costs $0.80, we can multiply the number of bananas in a bunch (4) by the cost per banana to find the cost of one bunch: 4 * $0.80 = $3.20. Then, we multiply this by 10 to find the total cost of buying 10 bunches individually: 10 * $3.20 = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches: 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we need to determine how much fence each person gets. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The amount of fence left over for Sam is 80 feet."
"To find the total growth in 13 years, we can multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years.

Growth rate per year = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches/year

Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold:
Number of Trekking bikes = Total bikes * 0.5
= 300 * 0.5
= 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold:
Number of BMX bikes = Total bikes * 0.15
= 300 * 0.15
= 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold:
Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - (Number of Trekking bikes + Number of BMX bikes)
= 300 - (150 + 45)
= 300 - 195
= 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes * Price of Trekking bike
= 150 * 450
= $67,500

Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes * Price of BMX bike
= 45 * 250
= $11,250

Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes * Price of MTB bike
= 105 * 500
= $52,500

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
= $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500
= $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field, we need to consider the rate at which the farmer and the truck are producing and consuming the hay.

The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, and the truck consumes 3 bales per hour. Since they work for 6 hours, we can calculate the total number of bales produced and consumed.

The total number of bales produced is 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales.

The total number of bales consumed is 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales consumed from the number of bales produced: 30 - 18 = 12 bales.

Therefore, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per week.

He attends 5 classes per day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes he spends in class per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Now, we need to add the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days. 

1/16 of 1000 minutes is 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

So, the total minutes he spends on learning per week is 1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60. 

1062.5 / 60 = 17.6875 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17.6875}$"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 x 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 x 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball will bounce to 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is 2/3 x 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball will go 32 feet on its second bounce."
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert the height of the first child to inches by multiplying 6 by 12, which gives us 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so we add 2 inches to the height of the first child: 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 inches from the height of the second child: 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 inches to the height of the third child: 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the number of bags sold.

2000 รท 10 = 200 bags

Since each bag is sold at $5, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. Let's start with the last step: the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat. Since the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let x be the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate. The velociraptors then ate x/2 kilograms. We know that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 270

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 540

Now that we know the amount left after the T-Rex ate, we can find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops. Since the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, we can set up another equation:

T-Rex's share = Initial amount / 2

We know the T-Rex ate 270 kilograms, so we can set up the equation:

270 = Initial amount / 2

To solve for the initial amount, we multiply both sides by 2:

Initial amount = 540

Therefore, there were 540 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

Final answer: 540"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of the friend getting a shaken can.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, 3 of which were shaken. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas. 

Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 5 unshaken sodas. The friend can choose from 7 sodas. The probability of the friend getting a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans, which is 2/7.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(2/7) * 100 = 28.57%

The final answer is: $\boxed{28.57\%}$"
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will have traveled:
60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled:
30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them:
180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since you can't take a fraction of a day off, we'll round down to 6 days.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help (25) by the number of people he can help per day (6):

25 * 6 = 150

Therefore, Billy can help 150 people.

Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age by adding 10 to Martha's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this amount of time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5:
1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first determine the distance Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We already know that Amber and Micah ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles together. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance run by all three:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. She returned one item that cost $15.00. So, the new balance is $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Then, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. The price after the discount is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

Next, she bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. The price after the discount is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased: $15.00 (returned item) + $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $58.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $70.00 + $58.00 = $128.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of large jellyfish and the number of jellyfish that change color when exposed to UV light.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as x. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of these large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and stay blue. We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means the number of large jellyfish that changed color is 6. This allows us to set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

Final answer: 90"
"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to set up an equation. Let's denote Chris's age as C, Ben's age as B, and Caroline's age as A.

We know that Chris is 4 years old, so C = 4.

We also know that Ben is two times older than Chris, so B = 2C.

Finally, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben, so A = 3B.

Substituting the value of B from the second equation into the third equation, we get A = 3(2C) = 6C.

Now, we can substitute the value of C into the equation A = 6C. Since C = 4, A = 6(4) = 24.

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"

"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4), and then divide the result by the number of equal parts each part will be divided into (5).

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Length of each part = Total length / Number of parts = 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm
Length of each final cut = Length of each part / Number of final parts = 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long."
"To find the total number of students in the school, we can set up a proportion. Since 40% of the students are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

0.4x = 240

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add the cost of the pots and the cost of the soil, then subtract the coupon value.

The cost of the pots is $19 and the cost of the soil is $26. 

First, we add the cost of the pots and the cost of the soil: $19 + $26 = $45.

Next, we subtract the coupon value of $7 from the total: $45 - $7 = $38.

Therefore, the total amount spent at the gardening shop is $38."
"To find the average height of heels, we need to add the total height of all the heels and divide by the total number of heels.

First, let's calculate the total height of all the heels. There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches. There are also 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches. The total height of all heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

Next, we need to divide the total height by the total number of heels. There are 3 + 3 = 6 heels in total. So, the average height of heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June, which has 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we can divide the total number of miles by the number of days.

9,300 miles รท 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day to meet her goal. To do this, we subtract 125 miles per day from the required daily amount.

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final answer: 185"
"To calculate the total amount the store will receive, we need to multiply the number of each color of balls by their respective costs and add them together.

The cost of red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.
The cost of blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the money he spent from the money he had initially.

Raymond initially had $21.
He saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.

He spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

Raymond has $8 left."
"To find the cost of each book, we need to first determine the total amount Anna spent on the books. We know that she had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, leaving her with $16 - $4 = $12. However, this $4 was not spent on the books. 

Let's recalculate: Anna had $12 left after the initial $4 was subtracted from her budget. She then spent $2 on the books, so she had $12 - $2 = $10 left. Since she has $2 left, the $10 must be the cost of the 2 books.

Since both books cost the same amount, we can divide $10 by 2 to find the cost of each book: $10 รท 2 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"To calculate the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year, we need to find 20% of the number of students last year and add it to the number of students last year.

20% of 50 can be calculated as 0.20 * 50 = 10.

The total number of students this year is the sum of the number of students last year and the 20% increase: 50 + 10 = 60.

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we can use the given rate of blinking. The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

First, we need to find the time it takes for the light to blink once. We can do this by dividing 5 minutes by 255 blinks.

Time per blink = 5 minutes / 255 blinks = 0.0198 minutes per blink

Now, we can multiply the time per blink by the total number of blinks to find the total time.

Total time = 0.0198 minutes per blink * 459 blinks = 9.05 minutes

So, it will take the light approximately 9.05 minutes to blink 459 times."
"To find the difference between the total number of female fish and male fish, we need to calculate the total number of each type of fish after Tate's purchase.

Initially, there were 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes.

Tate bought 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes. 

Let's calculate the new total for each type of fish:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the difference between the total number of female fish and male fish:
Total female fish: 8 + 8 = 16
Total male fish: 6 + 5 = 11

The difference between the total number of female fish and male fish is 16 - 11 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"

Now, let's add up the time each person took to complete their chores:
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance driven in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance and then multiply it by 2 (since he visits twice a month).

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, the total distance is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since he visits twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we need to first determine the distance Sofie walks in 7 days. Since Sofie walks 10 miles every day, we can multiply the number of days by the daily distance to find the total distance walked.

Distance = Number of days * Daily distance
Distance = 7 * 10
Distance = 70 miles

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can divide the distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian walks.

Brian's distance = Sofie's distance / 2
Brian's distance = 70 / 2
Brian's distance = 35 miles

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 400 toys were ordered, the fifth worker must produce 400 - 220 = 180 toys.

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is 180 / 10 = 18.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of both dogs: 
15 + 30 = 45 pounds

Therefore, Elijah and Kory's dogs weigh 45 pounds altogether."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob. So, Kris initially had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Since Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris, and Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers initially.

Now, we know that Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Let's represent the number of stickers Seth had initially as 'x'. Since Luis had 23 stickers, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 23

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

x = 23 * 2
x = 46

Therefore, Seth initially had 46 stickers.

The final answer is: 46"
"To find the total number of M&M's, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Total M&M's = 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag * 30 M&M's/ounce
Total M&M's = 3 * 10 * 30
Total M&M's = 900

Now, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag to find the number of small bags.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag
Number of small bags = 900 / 10
Number of small bags = 90

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to divide the distance by his daily distance.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that would be 20,000 kilometers. 

Now, we can divide the distance Alfie needs to fly by his daily distance to find the number of days it will take him to fly that distance.

Number of days = Distance to fly / Daily distance
= 20,000 km / 400 km
= 50 days

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow these steps:

First, we know that the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, we multiply 120 by 5 to get the speed of the 2nd fastest car.

2nd fastest car speed = 120 * 5 = 600 miles per hour

Next, we know that the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the faster car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.

Faster car speed = 600 * 1.25 = 750 miles per hour

Therefore, the faster car can go 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To find Vince's current age, we can use the information that Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age two years ago. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as x. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age two years ago, we can set up the equation:

2x = 14

To find Vince's age two years ago, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 14/2
x = 7

Now, we need to find Vince's current age. Since 2 years have passed, we add 2 to his age two years ago:

Vince's current age = x + 2
Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as S. Then, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.

Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can set up the equation: S + (S + 12) = 30.

Combine like terms: 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2S = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 9.

Now that we know Sarah painted 9 eggs, we can find the number of eggs Camden painted: S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, let's denote the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted as A. We know that A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combine like terms: 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2A = 26.

Divide both sides by 2: A = 13.

Now that we know Arnold painted 13 eggs, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted: 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the boxes separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is:

Weight of crayons = Number of crayons * Weight of each crayon
= 200 * 1
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of crayons to pounds:
Weight of crayons (in pounds) = Weight of crayons (in ounces) / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

Now, let's find the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes. The total weight of the boxes is:

Weight of boxes = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Converting the weight of boxes to pounds:
Weight of boxes (in pounds) = Weight of boxes (in ounces) / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is the sum of their individual weights:
Total weight = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

Final answer: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make from the tree. 

First, we find out how many logs he can make from the 80-foot tree. Since each log is 4 feet long, we divide the total length by the log length:

80 feet / 4 feet/log = 20 logs

Since each log can be cut into 5 planks, we multiply the number of logs by 5:

20 logs * 5 planks/log = 100 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank:

100 planks * $1.2/plank = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to calculate their combined salaries.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time spent walking on the beach and the time spent walking on the sidewalk.

First, let's find the time it takes for Grandma to walk 2 miles on the beach. We know that 40 minutes is spent on the beach, so we can set up a proportion to find the time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach:

Time = Distance / Speed

Since we don't know the speed, we can use the proportion:

40 minutes / 2 miles = x minutes / 2 miles

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

40 * 2 = 2x
80 = 2x
x = 80 / 2
x = 40 minutes

This means it takes Grandma 40 minutes to walk 2 miles on the beach.

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, it will take her half the time to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. So, it will take her:

40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes

to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

Now, we can add the time it takes to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time:

40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

Therefore, it takes Grandma 60 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we need to calculate the remaining amount she needs to save and then divide it by her weekly savings.

First, let's find the remaining amount she needs to save:
Total amount she wants to save: $60
Amount she has already saved: $32
Remaining amount: $60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find the number of weeks it will take:
$28 รท $4 = 7

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

Final answer: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

We have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, so we multiply 3 by 7 to get 21 blue birds. Then, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, so we multiply 2 by 4 to get 8 blue birds. Lastly, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To find out how many marbles Bob has initially, we can set up an equation. Let's say Bob has x marbles initially. If he receives 2 dozen (24) more marbles, he will have x + 24 marbles. We know that this equals 60. So, we can write the equation:

x + 24 = 60

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 marbles.

36 - 10 = 26

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the situation. Donny can drink the water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water, one at 33 degrees and the other at an unknown temperature, x.

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, he can drink the water. This means the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces.

The amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount of water from the other mug is 1 ounce. Since the total amount of water is 5 ounces, the temperature of the other mug must be 5 ounces / 1 ounce = 5 degrees.

However, we know that the temperature of the other mug must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink the water. Since 5 degrees is less than 40 degrees, we need to re-evaluate the situation.

Let's re-examine the problem. If Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, it means the 1-ounce amount from the other mug must be at least 40 degrees. 

Since the 1-ounce amount from the other mug is 1 ounce, the temperature of the other mug must be at least 40 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to consider the daily additions of cows and chickens.

The farm starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, and Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

The total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows. The total number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

The total number of cows after 3 weeks is 50 + 420 = 470 cows. The total number of chickens after 3 weeks is 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the cost of each bagel, we need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels and then divide it by the total number of bagels.

First, we calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels: 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. 10% of $40.00 is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels (4 packs * 9 bagels per pack = 36 bagels) to find the cost of each bagel: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

First, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
3 scoops - 1 scoop = 2 scoops
6 potatoes - 3 potatoes = 3 potatoes

Now, we know that 3 potatoes are needed for 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we divide 3 potatoes by 2 scoops.
3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop

Now, we know that 1.5 potatoes are needed for 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 5 scoops, we multiply 1.5 potatoes by 5 scoops.
1.5 potatoes/scoop * 5 scoops = 7.5 potatoes

Since Gomer ate 5 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can now find out how many potatoes he ate.
7.5 potatoes - 5 scoops = 2.5 potatoes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.5}$"
"To calculate the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to find the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs:

240 รท 12 = 20

Therefore, Chester needs 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of blue jellybeans as B. We know that the total number of jellybeans is 60, and the number of green jellybeans is 17, while the number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans, which is 2 * 17 = 34.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

B + 17 + 34 = 60

Combine like terms:

B + 51 = 60

Subtract 51 from both sides:

B = 9

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9."

"To find the number of women on the bus, we can use the ratio of men to women, which is 5:9. This means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14.

We can divide the total number of passengers (84) by the total number of parts (14) to find the value of one part: 84 รท 14 = 6.

Since the ratio of women is 9 parts, we multiply 9 by the value of one part (6): 9 ร 6 = 54.

Now, we know that 20 women alighted from the bus. To find the number of women who remained, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women (54): 54 - 20 = 34.

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to first find the total number of bouquets sold. 

Faraday earned $56 from the bouquet per day, and he sold it for 3 days, so the total number of bouquets sold is 56 / 8 = 7.

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold is 7 * 12 = 84.

However, we also know that Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers. Since each sunflower costs $2, the number of sunflowers sold can also be found by dividing the total earnings from sunflowers by the cost per sunflower: 26 / 2 = 13.

Since both methods should give the same result, we can confirm that the total number of sunflowers sold is indeed 84.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks and the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory.

Let's assume Adam buys x number of rocks. The cost of the rocks is $5x.

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, the number of rocks sold is 0.6x.

The revenue from selling 0.6x rocks at $7 each is 0.6x * 7 = $4.2x.

The total cost is $5x, and the total revenue is $4.2x. Since Adam invested all his money, the total revenue should be equal to the total cost.

However, this equation doesn't make sense, as the revenue is less than the cost. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Since Adam can't sell all his rocks, let's assume he sells 0.6x rocks and keeps the remaining 0.4x rocks.

The revenue from selling 0.6x rocks is 0.6x * 7 = $4.2x.

The cost of the rocks is $5x, and the cost of the remaining 0.4x rocks is 0.4x * 5 = $2x.

The total revenue is $4.2x, and the total cost is $7x. Since Adam invested all his money, the total revenue should be equal to the total cost.

The difference between the total cost and the total revenue is the amount of money Adam loses. The amount of money Adam loses is $7x - $4.2x = $2.8x.

Since Adam invested $100, we can set up a proportion to find the value of x:

$2.8x = $100

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2.8:

Since Adam can't sell all his rocks, let's assume he sells 0.6x rocks and keeps the remaining 0.4x rocks.

The revenue from selling 0.6x rocks is 0.6x * 7 = $4.2x.

The cost of the rocks is $5x, and the cost of the remaining 0.4x rocks is 0.4x * 5 = $2x.

The total cost is $5x + $2x = $7x.

Since Adam invested all his money, the total revenue should be equal to the total cost.

We can set up the equation: 4.2x = 7x

However, this equation doesn't make sense. Let's try another approach.

The total revenue is $4.2x, and the total cost is $7x. Since Adam invested all his money, the total revenue should be equal to the total cost.

The difference between the total cost and the total revenue is the amount of money Adam loses. The amount of money Adam loses is $7x - $4.2x = $2.8x.

Since Adam invested $100, we can set up a proportion to find the value of x:

$2.8x = $100

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2.8:

x = $100 / 2.8
x = 35.71

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the amount of money Adam loses:

Amount of money lost = $2.8x
= $2.8 * 35.71
= $100 - $100
= $0

However, this doesn't make sense, as Adam can't sell all his rocks. Let's try another approach.

Since Adam can't sell all his rocks, let's assume he sells 0.6x rocks and keeps the remaining 0.4x rocks.

The revenue from selling 0.6x rocks is 0.6x * 7 = $4.2x.

The cost of the rocks is $5x, and the cost of the remaining 0.4x rocks is 0.4x * 5 = $2x.

The total cost is $5x + $2x = $7x.

Since Adam invested all his money, the total revenue should be equal to the total cost.

We can set up the equation: 4.2x = 7x

However, this equation doesn't make sense. Let's try another approach.

The total revenue is $4.2x, and the total cost is $7x. Since Adam invested all his money, the total revenue should be equal to the total cost.

"To determine the total number of days required to complete the project, we need to find the maximum number of days it takes to complete each type of picture scene and then add them together.

Let's calculate the number of days for each type of picture scene:

Large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
Small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since the days for each type of scene are not the same, we need to find the maximum number of days, which is 9 days.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the number of eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. Since there are three dozen eggs, we can calculate this as follows:

3 dozen eggs = 3 x 12 = 36 eggs

There are 4 children. 

36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs per child.

Therefore, each child receives 9 eggs."
"To calculate the total cost of food for Jen's fish in May, we need to multiply the number of days in May (31) by the daily cost of food per fish ($1).

Total cost = Number of days in May * Daily cost of food per fish

Total cost = $31

Jen spends $31 on food for her fish in May."
"To find the total number of roses Patricia has now, we need to subtract the number of roses she gave to her mother and then add the number of roses she bought.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Start with the initial number of roses: 30
2. Subtract the number of roses given to her mother: 30 - 24 = 6
3. Add the number of roses bought: 6 + 15 = 21

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses.

Final answer: 21"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The total distance traveled is the sum of the initial 110 miles and the additional 140 miles, which equals 250 miles. The total time taken is the sum of the initial 2 hours and the additional 3 hours, which equals 5 hours.

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour

The final answer is 50."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply the probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12\%}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. Let's say Carlos collected x seashells. Then, we can set up an equation:

x + 5 = 27

Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get:

x = 22

So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Let's say Carrey collected y seashells. Then, we can set up another equation:

x = 2y

Substituting x = 22, we get:

22 = 2y

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

y = 11

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now, let's find the total number of seashells. We know that Carlos collected 22 seashells, Jim collected 27 seashells, and Carrey collected 11 seashells. Adding these together, we get:

22 + 27 + 11 = 60

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend:
20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week."
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:

60% of 5 minutes = 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes
So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song.
The length of the second song = 5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette:
Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
Total time = 5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To calculate the profit, we need to find the total cost and the total selling price of the mobile devices.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * (2 * $20) = 2 * $40 = $80.
The selling price of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * (2 * $20) = 4 * $40 = $160.
The total selling price is $80 + $160 = $240.

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $120
Profit = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we can analyze the given information step by step.

First, we know that Isabel is 7 feet tall. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 feet - 2 feet
Ned's height = 5 feet

Next, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. So, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 feet + 1 foot
Carl's height = 6 feet

Finally, since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, we can calculate the length of the cane as follows:

Length of cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of cane = 6 feet / 2
Length of cane = 3 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required.

Each bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand. So, to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need:

Total bottles needed = 2300 people * 100% / 20%
Total bottles needed = 2300 * 1 / 0.2
Total bottles needed = 11500

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to consider the number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies (since it's an octuplet).

Number of babies wearing purple = 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue = 1/4 * 8 = 2

Number of babies wearing bows = 1/3 * (number of purple wearers) + (number of blue wearers) 
= 1/3 * 6 + 2
= 2 + 2
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:
Probability = (number of purple bow wearers) / (total number of bow wearers)
= (number of purple wearers) / (number of purple wearers + number of blue wearers)
= 6 / (6 + 2)
= 6 / 8
= 3/4
= 0.75
= 75%

The probability can also be expressed as a percentage, which is 75%.

The final answer is 75%."

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to calculate the amount he earned from each sale and add them together.

Abraham initially sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. This means he sold 40 square meters of land. To find the price per square meter, we can divide the amount he earned ($50) by the amount of land sold (40 square meters):

$50 รท 40 mยฒ = $1.25 per square meter

Now, we know the price per square meter for each sale. To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to calculate the amount he earned from each sale and add them together.

For the first sale, he sold 40 square meters at $1.25 per square meter, so he earned:
40 mยฒ ร $1.25/mยฒ = $50

For the second sale, he sold 20 square meters at $1.5 per square meter, so he earned:
20 mยฒ ร $1.5/mยฒ = $30

Now, we add the amounts he earned from each sale:
$50 + $30 = $80

The final answer is: $80"
"To find Geb's age, we need to calculate half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from that result.

Haley's age is given as 26 years. Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.

Since Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age, we subtract 10 from 13.

Geb's age = 13 - 10 = 3.

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"To find the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the number of face masks he uses in a day and then multiply it by 2.

Since Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks per day.

Now, to find the total number of face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:
6 face masks/day * 2 days = 12 face masks

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is equivalent to 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of apartments, we need to first find the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

Since he collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1440 * 3 = 4320.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 4320 * 0.40 = $1728.

The final answer is: $1728"
"To calculate the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to consider the production pattern of the tree.

The tree produces 50 fruits in the first year, then triples the initial amount in the second year, and continues this pattern. In the seventh year, it produces 7 times the initial amount, and in the eighth year, it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. The ninth year sees no fruit production, and the tenth year produces 20 times the initial amount.

Let's break down the production for each year:

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * 17150 - 200 = 17100 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 + 0 + 1000 = 52500

The total number of fruits that an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 52500."
"To find out how many dollars Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of $100. 

1/5 of $100 is equal to $20. 

Jack had $100 initially. Sophia gave him $20. 

$100 + $20 = $120

Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using variables to represent the lengths of the ropes. Let's say the length of the yellow rope is Y, the blue rope is B, and the red rope is R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write an equation:
B = Y - 7

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write another equation:
R = 4B

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write a third equation:
Y + B + R = 37

Now, we can substitute the expression for B in terms of Y into the third equation:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left after giving an equal amount to her sister. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa got 3 times the amount Ronnie got. Since Ronnie got $5, Rissa got 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount of money she has left is 15 - x.

Since she is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

To solve for x, we can multiply 4/5 by 15:

15 - x = 12

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 15 - 12
x = 3

So, Rissa gave her sister $3. Now, we know that Rissa has 15 - 3 = $12 left.

Since Ronnie gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3. Now, we can find out how much money Ronnie has left:

Ronnie's initial money: $5
Ronnie gave her sister: $3
Ronnie's remaining money: $5 - $3 = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's say the amount of red, white, and purple paint used is 'x'. Since there are equal amounts of these three colors, the total amount of paint used for these colors is 3x.

We know that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint used is also 'x'. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so we can set up the equation:

3x + x = 12

Combine like terms:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

Since 'x' represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 3 pints.

The final answer is 3."
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 feet x 12 feet = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 x 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 + 1200 + 1000 = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

Final answer: 2440"
"To calculate the total number of clouds Alice counted, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The number of clouds on each day is doubling the previous day, which forms a geometric sequence. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is:

S = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)

where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 3 (the number of clouds on Monday), r = 2 (since the number of clouds doubles each day), and n = 5 (the number of days).

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = 3 * (2^5 - 1) / (2 - 1)
S = 3 * (32 - 1) / 1
S = 3 * 31
S = 93

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To find the number of cycles you can run for $1, we need to calculate the cost per pod in the new box. 

The new box has 120 pods and costs $12. 
Cost per pod = Total cost / Total pods = $12 / 120 pods = $0.1 per pod.

Now, we can divide $1 by the cost per pod to find the number of cycles: 
$1 / $0.1 per pod = 10 cycles.

So, you can run 10 cycles for $1."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Thomas starts with $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he has 50 bills initially.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Next, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills and is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * 5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.5}$"
"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, he recycled the chalk after using 2.25 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.25 inches at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. Then, 20% of the remaining chalk will be used each day.

0.20 * 2.25 = 0.45 inches (used each day)

Since the teacher has 2.25 inches of chalk left, we can set up an equation:

2.25 - 0.45x = 0

Solving for x, we get:

2.25 - 0.45x = 0
0.45x = 2.25
x = 2.25 / 0.45
x = 5

So, the teacher will use up the remaining chalk in 5 days.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we need to first calculate the number of students on varsity.

The number of girls on varsity is one-third of the total number of girls, which is 1/3 * 12 = 4.

The number of boys on varsity is one-fourth of the total number of boys, which is 1/4 * 12 = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is the sum of the number of girls and boys on varsity, which is 4 + 3 = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 + 12 = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is the difference between the total number of students and the total number of students on varsity, which is 24 - 7 = 17.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to calculate the number of face masks he purchased. 

Since Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, we can represent this as an equation: 

Let's denote the number of face masks Mike bought as M. Then, the number of face masks Johnny bought can be represented as 3M + 2.

We know Mike bought 5 face masks, so M = 5. 

Now, we can substitute M into the equation: 3(5) + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17.

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final answer is 17."
"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixed, we need to calculate the total number of teeth fixed and divide it by the total number of teeth.

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than the number drilled, so the total number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11.

Total number of teeth fixed = Number of teeth drilled + Number of teeth capped
= 4 + 11
= 15

Total number of teeth = 30

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15/30) * 100
= 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the refund, we need to find 2/5 of the total gallons of milk purchased. 

2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons

Since Mr. Marcellus is returning 1600 gallons of milk, the cost of the returned milk would be:

1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up two equations based on the given information.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute W = 5C + 35 into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to divide the total amount he has ($27,000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

$27,000 รท $500 = 54 sets of 100 books

Since Bob is distributing the money to 3 schools, we can divide the total number of sets by 3.

54 sets รท 3 schools = 18 sets per school

Since each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find out the total number of books per school.

18 sets per school ร 100 books per set = 1800 books per school

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples. Then, he put 1 apple in his pocket and threw 1 apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. This means he now has 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples.

Next, he put all but 1 apple in his pocket, so he has 7 - 1 = 6 apples left. He then threw 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. So, he now has 6 (previous) + 6 (new) = 12 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples.

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by her friends and then divide that by the total number of slices per pizza.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so the total number of slices each friend eats is 6 + 4 = 10 slices.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. To find out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to divide the total number of slices eaten (60) by the total number of slices per pizza (12 + 8 = 20).

60 รท 20 = 3

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 pizzas.

John's age = 2 * Jim's age

We are given that John's current age is 28. We can substitute this value into the equation:

28 = 2 * Jim's age

To solve for Jim's age, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Jim's age = 28 / 2
Jim's age = 14

Therefore, Jim is 14 years old.

1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 6."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The nurses start with an unknown number of bandages, let's call it x. On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had x + 12 bandages from the first day, so they had x + 12 + 28 = x + 40 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had x + 40 - 25 = x + 15 bandages left.

Since they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, we can set up the equation x + 15 = 78.

To solve for x, we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: x = 78 - 15.

x = 63

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to determine her total hours worked and her total earnings from both her hourly rate and attendance.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April. So, her total hours worked in April can be calculated as:

Total hours worked = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks
= 7.5 * 6 * 4
= 180 hours

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her total earnings from her hourly rate can be calculated as:

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour
= $270

Since Jen has complete attendance, she receives an additional $10. Therefore, her total earnings can be calculated as:

Total earnings = Total earnings from hourly rate + $10
= $270 + $10
= $280

The final answer is: $280"
"To calculate Jason's total earnings, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the corresponding amount and then add them together.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately and then add them together.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:

Cost per bottle of scotch = $600 รท 10
Cost per bottle of scotch = $60

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. To find the cost of the cognac per bottle, we multiply the cost of the scotch by 1.5 (100% + 50%):

Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 ร 1.5
Cost per bottle of cognac = $90

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 ร 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 ร $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac:
Total cost = $600 + $1800
Total cost = $2400

"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

The total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees.

The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80 trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 (first day) + 80 (second day) = 140 trees.

"To solve this problem, we need to isolate the variable x, which represents the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge. We can start by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

Subtract 8 from both sides:
4x = 32

Next, we'll divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:

4x / 4 = 32 / 4

x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we find one-third of the total number of fish, which is 66. 

The number of fish with red stripes is 66 / 3 = 22.

Next, we find the remaining fish by subtracting the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish: 66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish. To do this, we multiply 44 by 5/11.

The number of fish with blue stripes is 44 * (5/11) = 20.

To find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes: 22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is 42."
"To find the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy had initially, we need to calculate the total colors from the palettes and the makeup sets.

Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 colors left.

The final answer is 19."
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the roof. 

First, we find the height of the first floor: 
The height of the first floor is 7 times the height of Mattison, and Mattison is 60 inches tall. 
So, the height of the first floor is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

Next, we find the height of the second floor: 
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, 
so the height of the second floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Now, we find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor: 
The height of the roof is the difference between the height of the first floor and the height of the second floor, 
which is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"To find the number of shells team Gogetters found, we need to calculate the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found 40% of the total shells.

First, we find 40% of 700:

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280

Now, we subtract the number of shells found by team Alphas from the total number of shells to find the remaining shells:

Remaining shells = 700 - 280 = 420

Next, we find 60% of the remaining shells to determine the number of shells found by team The finders:

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252

Finally, we subtract the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters:

Shells found by team Gogetters = 420 - 252 = 168

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To find the total miles the dogs need to walk per day, we can multiply the number of dogs by the average miles they need to walk per day.

4 dogs * 3 miles = 12 miles

Since we know the first three dogs' walking distances, we can subtract those from the total to find the last dog's walking distance.

12 miles - 1 mile - 4 miles - 3 miles = 4 miles

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate how much money John had leftover after paying his debts, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we find 40% of the house's value, which is $250,000. To do this, we multiply $250,000 by 0.4.

$250,000 x 0.4 = $100,000

This is the amount John borrowed. Then, he uses 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. To find 60% of $100,000, we multiply $100,000 by 0.6.

$100,000 x 0.6 = $60,000

Now, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the total borrowed amount to find out how much money John had leftover.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

The final answer is $40,000."
"To find the total weight of the tunas caught, we need to add the weights of all three tunas: 
56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram:
128 * 0.50 = $64.

The total amount Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas to the market is $64."
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to calculate the difference between the selling price and the cost price.

The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. 

Cost price = $72
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
= (11 * 9)
= 99

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
= 99 - 72
= 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day, and Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

To find the total amount of water removed, we add the amounts from each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the number of balloons thrown, we can use a simple subtraction problem. 

Let's break it down:

Total number of balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons
Number of balloons left = 12

Number of balloons thrown = Total number of balloons - Number of balloons left
= 300 - 12
= 288

Therefore, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons."
"To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we need to first find the amount of each medicine in one dose.

The first medicine requires 14 mL per dose. The second medicine requires 3 times that amount, which is 3 x 14 = 42 mL.

So, in one dose, Saanvi uses 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8:
56 mL x 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to calculate the capacity of one of his classes. Since each class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can multiply the capacity of Ali's class by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = (1/8) ร 120
= 120 รท 8
= 15

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is 2 ร 15
= 30

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of their capacities: 120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school)
= 120 + 30
= 150

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the interest first.

The interest is 2% of the initial amount borrowed, which is $300.

Interest = 0.02 * $300 = $6

The total amount Stephen will pay in 11 months is $25 per month.

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Now, we add the interest to the total amount paid in 11 months to find the amount to be paid in the twelfth month.

Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = Total amount paid in 11 months + Interest
= $275 + $6
= $281

The final answer is: $281"
"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to calculate the total number of diaper changes required and then divide it by 2 since Jordan's wife also changes half of the diapers.

There are 2 children, and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day. So, the total number of diaper changes is:

2 children * 5 diaper changes per child = 10 diaper changes

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, Jordan will also change half of the diapers. To find out how many diapers Jordan changes, we divide the total number of diaper changes by 2:

10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar and then divide it by the efficiency and the percentage of red jelly beans.

The volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 360 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans: 360 / 0.8 = 450.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans: 450 * 0.3 = 135.

However, we know the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 135 = 765.

The final answer is: $\boxed{765}$"
"To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to follow the steps:

The bus initially had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, making the total 20 + 40 = 60. Then, at the second station, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop boarded the bus. This is equivalent to 3/4 * 40 = 30 people. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90. 

At the third station, the number of passengers doubled, making the total 90 * 2 = 180. Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the remaining spaces are 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits, we need to calculate the cost of her visits for the first 5 years and the next 3 years.

Initially, the cost of one visit was $2. After a 150% increase, the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, so she spent 5 * 3 = $15 per year. For 5 years, she spent 5 * $15 = $75.

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit is $5, and she visited the museum 3 times a year, so she spent 3 * $5 = $15 per year. For 3 years, she spent 3 * $15 = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits is $75 + $45 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the total time required for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students/grade * 3 grades = 30 students
30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students.

The time required for each group is 45 minutes. So, the total time required for 3 full groups is:

3 groups * 45 minutes/group = 135 minutes

For the 4th group with 2 students, the time required is 45 minutes.

Total time required = 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"To find the total amount Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the cost of the tables and the roof frames separately and then add them together.

The cost of 4 tables at $20 each is 4 x $20 = $80.

"To find the length of the longer piece, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40. We can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs, we can use a simple multiplication problem. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs he wants (80) by 16 to find the number of pounds of meat he needs.

80 meatballs รท 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat, we can multiply the number of pounds by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds ร 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total amount of fabric Luke needs to buy, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window and then multiply the result by 2.

Number of windows = 5
Width of each window = 35 inches

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, so the total cost is:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. 

Then, we add 1 more inch to this amount, so the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting the number of cupcakes Carly made be represented by 'x'. Since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies can be represented as 3x - 2.

We know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. This can be represented as an equation:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

To solve for x, we can combine like terms:

4x - 2 = 10

Adding 2 to both sides of the equation gives us:

4x = 12

Dividing both sides by 4:

x = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost of the manicure and pedicure with nail art, we need to first find the discounted price of the services. The original cost of the manicure is $35, and the pedicure is $40. The total cost without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The 20% discount is 0.20 * $75 = $15. So, the discounted price is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art sessions (5 for each hand). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

Final answer: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send 3 x 12 = 36 issues per year.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 1 x 6 = 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 x 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines per year."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley has x + 8 paintings. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha has (x + 8) - 12 paintings.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

First, we calculate the price in December by adding 80% of the initial price to the initial price. This can be expressed as:

Price in December = Initial price + (80% of Initial price)
= $40 + (0.8 * $40)
= $40 + $32
= $72

Next, we calculate the price in January by subtracting 50% of the price in December from the price in December. This can be expressed as:

Price in January = Price in December - (50% of Price in December)
= $72 - (0.5 * $72)
= $72 - $36
= $36

Therefore, the price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from each type of lesson and add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount he earns from the 4 1-hour lessons at the standard rate. Since the standard rate is $80 per hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate:

4 * $80 = $320

Next, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran. The rate for veteran lessons is 25% less than the standard rate. To find the reduced rate, we calculate 25% of the standard rate and subtract it from the standard rate:

25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
$80 - $20 = $60

Now, we multiply the reduced rate by the number of hours:

2 * $60 = $120

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of lessons:

$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores. The formula for mean is:

Mean = (Sum of all scores) / (Total number of scores)

In this case, the sum of all scores is 630, and the total number of scores is 9.

Mean = 630 / 9
Mean = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to determine the number of pomelos she had initially and then subtract the number she had left.

Since Eve had 1/4 of the original amount left, we can set up the equation:

Number of pomelos left = 1/4 ร Initial number of pomelos
5 = 1/4 ร Initial number of pomelos

To find the initial number of pomelos, we can multiply both sides by 4:

Initial number of pomelos = 5 ร 4
Initial number of pomelos = 20

Now, we can find the number of pomelos Eve gave away by subtracting the number she had left from the initial amount:

Number of pomelos given away = Initial number of pomelos - Number of pomelos left
= 20 - 5
= 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"To find the number of apples Walter ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples

Walter ate 24 apples, so the remaining number of apples is:
60 - 24 = 36 apples

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples:
25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9 apples

The remaining number of apples is:
36 - 9 = 27 apples

Walter sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each:
27 * 3 = $81

The final answer is: $81"
"To find the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we need to multiply the number of novels she wrote last year by 4, since 3 quarters is equivalent to 3/4.

Let's calculate the total number of novels she has written this year:

9 * 4 = 36

So, Regina has written 36 novels this year.

Final answer: 36"
"To find the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled and then divide it by the total distance between Alaska and Texas.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr, and he traveled for 3 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total hours he traveled is 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total distance covered. To do this, we'll divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100.

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 / 6000) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

So, Michael covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas."
"To determine the initial number of grapes, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know that the mother used 48 grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. We can calculate the total number of grapes used by the mother as 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Next, we know that Madeline and her brother used a total of 36 grapes. Since we know the mother used 48 grapes, we can find the initial number of grapes by adding the grapes used by the family (36) to the grapes used by the mother (48). 

Initial number of grapes = 36 (used by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (used by the mother) = 84 grapes.

Final answer: 84"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of sick teachers and the number of substitute teachers.

The total number of teachers is the sum of the number of sick teachers and the number of substitute teachers. 

Number of sick teachers: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

Total number of teachers = 13 + 9
Total number of teachers = 22

Therefore, there were 22 teachers at school that day."
"To calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to consider the cost of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of pasta is $1.00 per box, and Bud buys one box per week. The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00 per week, and the cost of gruyere cheese is twice that amount, which is $6.00 per week. 

The total cost per week is the sum of the costs of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese: $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total cost per year is $10.00 per week * 52 weeks per year = $520.00 per year.

The final answer is: $520."
"To find the total time spent cleaning, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom: 
80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours: 
1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

Now, we need to find the percentage of the day spent cleaning. To do this, we'll divide the time spent cleaning by the total time worked and multiply by 100: 
(20 hours / 40 hours) * 100 = 50%

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we need to calculate the total capacity of the shelves and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the shelves: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books
Total capacity: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves to find the number of bookcases needed:
110 รท 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the books. Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases.

Final answer: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

First, let's find the total cost:
Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 5 dozens will have 5 x 12 = 60 eggs. The total cost is 5 x $2.40 = $12.

Next, let's find the total selling price:
Rose will sell each egg for $1, so the total selling price is 60 x $1 = $60.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
= $60 - $12
= $48

The final answer is: $48"
"To find the number of white hats, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we know that half of the hats are red. Since Skyler has 100 hats in total, the number of red hats is 100 / 2 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

Next, we're told that 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find the number of blue hats, we multiply 3/5 by the remaining hats: 3/5 * 50 = 30.

Now, to find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to calculate the discounted price of the bag and then divide it by the number of sticks.

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is:
$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost per stick:
$15.00 รท 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100:
$0.50 ร 100 = 50 cents

"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to get correct overall. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, and the total number of questions is 110 (70 from the first test and 40 from the second test), we can calculate this as follows:

Total questions needed correct = 0.7 * 110
Total questions needed correct = 77

Since Audrey got 60% of the first test correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions, we can subtract this from the total questions needed correct to find out how many she needs to get right on the second test:

Questions needed correct on the second test = Total questions needed correct - Questions got correct on the first test
Questions needed correct on the second test = 77 - 42
Questions needed correct on the second test = 35

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is 35."
"To find the number of blueberry cubes, we can set up an equation. Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is x. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

The final answer is: 96"

Total points = 840

Therefore, Ara has scored a total of 840 points in the four years."
"To determine the number of marbles Brendan ended up with, let's break down the events step by step.

Brendan initially had 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, which means he lost 5 marbles. This can be represented as 10 - 5 = 5. Then, he found 3 more marbles, so now he has 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. However, he picked up a bead instead of a marble, so he got rid of 1 marble. This can be represented as 8 - 1 = 7.

Therefore, Brendan ended up with 7 marbles.

Final answer: 7"
"To calculate the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold. So, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs 15 / 1 = 15 customers. Since 1 customer is generated from 2 potential customers, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 potential customers.

Next, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 potential customer is generated. To get 30 potential customers, Jason needs 30 / 1 = 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of each type of light source.

There are 8 rooms in the house, and half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, while the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of the rooms is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms. 
4 rooms with 4 small candles each will have 4 * 4 = 16 small candles.
4 rooms with 5 medium candles each will have 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.

Total number of candles = 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Total number of candles and flashlights = 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. Since Mitchell buys two bags of chips with 55 chips each, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Number of family members = 5

Number of chips per person = Total number of chips / Number of family members
= 110 chips / 5

Therefore, each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the total time it takes to complete all six sides. 

The first side takes 5 minutes. The second and third sides take twice as long, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes. The last two sides take half as long as the first, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

The total time to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes."
"To find the total number of items, we need to first determine the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are 20 helmets and there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can set up an equation:

Number of helmets = Number of footballs / 2
20 = Number of footballs / 2
Number of footballs = 20 * 2
Number of footballs = 40

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can set up another equation:

Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends on calls and then divide that by the time it takes to deal with a single call.

Since Tim spends 6 hours a day on calls, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes he spends on calls per day as 6 * 60 = 360 minutes.

There are 5 days in a work week, so the total minutes he spends on calls in a week is 360 * 5 = 1800 minutes.

Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call, the total number of calls he deals with in a week is 1800 / 15 = 120 calls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To find the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we can break it down into three groups based on the amount of water each group of plants requires.

First, let's calculate the amount of water needed for the 4 plants that require half a cup of water. This can be calculated as 4 x 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, we have the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each, so the total amount of water needed for these plants is 8 x 1 = 8 cups.

The remaining plants are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants. Since these plants require a quarter of a cup of water, the total amount of water needed for these plants is 8 x 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's add the water needed for each group: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes Phineas to hop on land and the time it takes him to swim in the water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. We can calculate the time it takes to cover each part separately.

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute
Time on land = 5 minutes

Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute
Time in water = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on land + Time in water
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of the popsicle sticks needed for Bob's project, we can divide the total number of sticks required (56) by the number of sticks per box (8).

Since each box costs $2.00, we can multiply the number of boxes needed (7) by the cost per box ($2.00) to find the total cost.

7 ร $2.00 = $14.00

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the additional phones.

The main phone costs $20. Since it's mentioned that the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 x $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones: $20 + $40 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To calculate the total amount of money Derrick makes in June, we need to multiply the number of doughnuts he sells per day by the number of days in June and then multiply the result by the price per doughnut.

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts per day, which is equivalent to 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day. Since June has 30 days, Derrick makes a total of 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts in June.

The price per doughnut is $2, so the total amount of money Derrick makes in June is 3600 * 2 = $7200.

The final answer is: $7200"
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we can divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

"To calculate the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first find his new speed in words per minute. 

His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 2.5 * 150 = 375 WPM.

Since each page has 450 words, the total number of words in 10 pages is 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we divide the total number of words by the speed: 
4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

Day 1: 50 people
Day 2: 50 + 20 = 70 people
Day 3: 70 * 2 = 140 people

Since Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week (4 days), we can calculate the total number of people for those days as follows:
60 * 4 = 240 people

Now, let's add up the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:

"To calculate the total number of kernels that popped, we need to break down the problem into four time intervals and calculate the number of kernels popped in each interval.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased three times, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped. Then, in the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased four times the initial rate, resulting in 4 * 20 = 80 kernels. Finally, in the last 30 seconds, the popping rate decreased to half the previous rate, resulting in 40 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat. A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

The total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

The final answer is: $\boxed{210}$"
"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required. Since Tim wants to make 5 gallons of lemonade, and each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, we can calculate the total number of cups of lemon juice needed:

5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed by dividing the total cups of lemon juice by 6:

5 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 5 * 6 = 30 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 30 lemons.

"To determine the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The daily consumption of dog food for the German Shepherds is 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg/day. Similarly, the daily consumption of dog food for the Bulldogs is 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg/day. 

The total daily consumption is the sum of the consumption of both breeds: 15 kg/day + 6 kg/day = 21 kg/day.

To find the total weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7: 21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

The farm has 10 two-legged animals and 15 four-legged animals. We can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

2-legged animals: 10 * 2 = 20 legs
4-legged animals: 15 * 4 = 60 legs

Total legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs

Now, divide the total legs by 2 to get the total number of pairs of legs:
80 / 2 = 40 pairs

Therefore, there are 40 pairs of animal legs on the farm."
"To find the number of red blocks, we can start by determining the total number of blue and yellow blocks. Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, we can represent the number of yellow blocks as 2 times the number of blue blocks. Let's denote the number of blue blocks as B. Then, the number of yellow blocks is 2B.

We know that the total number of blue blocks is 4, so B = 4. Therefore, the number of yellow blocks is 2B = 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is B + 2B = 3B = 3 * 4 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks is 32 - 12 = 20.

"To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first part of the journey (west), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

For the second part of the journey (east), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Total distance traveled = 90 miles + 144 miles = 234 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. To do this, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

"To calculate the value of the boat after three years, we need to find the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after 1 year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after 2 years = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after 3 years = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first determine the number of orange and yellow candies.

The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so:
Orange candies = 2 * 54 = 108

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so:
Yellow candies = 54 / 2 = 27

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
Red + Orange + Yellow = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
232 - 189 = 43

Therefore, there are 43 pink candies in the bag."
"To find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the bus trips first.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 10% of $80.
10% of $80 = 0.1 x $80 = $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is:
$8 x 7 = $56

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is:
$80 (hotel) + $56 (bus trips) = $136

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had initially. Since Dallas dropped 4 marbles, we can calculate the initial amount by adding those dropped marbles back to the amount Dallas had after the drop.

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we can set up an equation to find the initial amount:

Initial amount = 21 (marbles after drop) + 4 (marbles dropped)

Initial amount = 25

Now that we know Dallas initially had 25 marbles, we can find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla by subtracting the initial amount from the total number of marbles Mazie had.

Mazie had 52 marbles, so we can set up the equation:

Number of marbles given to Darla = Total marbles - Initial amount
= 52 - 25
= 27

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns. 

The cost of the tickets is $12 per adult and $8 per child. Since there are 3 people in the family (2 adults and 1 child), the total cost of the tickets is:

2 adult tickets = 2 x $12 = $24
1 child ticket = $8
Total cost of tickets = $24 + $8 = $32

The cost of the popcorns is $3 per pop. Since they bought 2 popcorns, the total cost of the popcorns is:

2 popcorns = 2 x $3 = $6

Now, we add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns to find the total cost:

Total cost = $32 (tickets) + $6 (popcorns) = $38

Therefore, the family pays a total of $38."
"To calculate the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."
"To determine the amount of crepe paper needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. In this case, the long side is 20 feet and the short side is 15 feet.

Therefore, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence."
"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we need to add their ages and divide by 2. Since Mia is 16 years younger than Emma, we can find Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of their ages is 48."

"To determine how much feed is left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs in a week.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the daily feed consumption per pig is 4 pounds * 2 = 8 pounds. Since there are 5 pigs, the total daily feed consumption is 8 pounds/pig * 5 pigs = 40 pounds.

In a week, the pigs will consume 40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much is left, we subtract the total feed consumed from the total ordered:

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

Therefore, there are 20 pounds of feed left after a week.

"To determine the total number of hot dogs John needs, we can multiply the number of guests by the number of hot dogs each guest will eat.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs required: 20 * 2 = 40

Since John already has 4 hot dogs, we subtract those from the total:
40 - 4 = 36

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs.
Number of packs needed: 36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs 6 packs, and each pack costs $2, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
6 * $2 = $12

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple arithmetic sequence. 

Let's break it down step by step:

Initially, there are 5 children following the truck.

On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 1 = 6.

On the third street, each of the 6 children is joined by 2 more children, so the total number of children becomes 6 + 6*2 = 6 + 12 = 18.

However, the original 5 children then leave the group, so the total number of children remaining is 18 - 5 = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 children following the truck.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"

Total time spent on meditation = 30 * 2 * 4 * 7 = 3360 minutes

Time spent on yoga:
- 1 hour per day
- 5 days a week
- 4 weeks
- 7 days a week
Total time spent on yoga = 1 * 5 * 4 * 7 = 140 hours

To convert hours to minutes, multiply by 60
Total time spent on yoga = 140 * 60 = 8400 minutes

Total time spent on meditation and yoga = 3360 minutes + 8400 minutes
Total time spent on meditation and yoga = 11760 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60
Total time spent on meditation and yoga = 11760 / 60 = 196 hours

The total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks is 196 hours."
"To calculate the total square feet of fabric needed for the quilt, we need to multiply the number of each type of shirt by its corresponding area and add them together.

The area of a small t-shirt is 3 square feet, a medium t-shirt is 4 square feet, and a large t-shirt is 6 square feet. 

First, we'll calculate the total area of each type of shirt:
- Small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
- Medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
- Large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Now, let's add the total area of each type of shirt:
33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet

The quilt will require 101 square feet of fabric."
"To find the total number of sunflower seeds, we need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then add 50% more seeds to it.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. Then, we add 18 to 36, resulting in 54 seeds.

Now, we add the seeds from the small sunflower (36) and the large sunflower (54) to get the total number of seeds: 36 + 54 = 90.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to first determine the number of pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can multiply 18 by 3 to find Timothy's pens.

18 ร 3 = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can divide 54 by 2.

54 รท 2 = 27

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to set up an equation. Let's denote Jackie's height before the summer as x.

Since Albert is 36"" tall, and Anne is twice the size of Albert, we can express Anne's height as 2 * 36"" = 72"".

We also know that Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so we can express Jackie's height as 72"" - 2"" = 70"".

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we can set up the equation:

x + 3"" = 70""

To solve for x, we can subtract 3"" from both sides of the equation:

x = 70"" - 3""
x = 67""

Therefore, Jackie's height before the summer was 67""."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to multiply the number of bars produced in two weeks by the price per bar.

The company produces 5000 bars in one day. In two weeks, it will produce:
5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70,000 bars

The price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive is:
70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000

The final answer is: $140,000"
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts, and the original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt. The discount on the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is $4. So, the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 - $4 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake buys them at 40% off. The discount is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 x $40 = $16. The cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his earnings from completing chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are:
6 * 3 = $18

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of the ice cream cones is:
1.25 * 4 = $5

Now, subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings:
$18 - $5 = $13

Ryan has $13 left. To find out how many movie tickets he can buy, we can divide $13 by the cost of each ticket:
$13 รท $6.50 = 2

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add up the costs of all the items purchased.

Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So, her total is $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. The total cost of the bathrobes is $100 x 2 = $200. Adding the cost of the sunglasses, her total is $30 + $200 = $230.

To find the total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani, we add their totals: $105 + $230 = $335.

The final answer is: $335"
"To calculate the profit made from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to first find the total cost of making one jar and then multiply it by 10.

The cost of the ingredients for one jar is as follows:
- 2 pounds of passion fruit: 2 * $6 = $12
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit: 1.5 * $8 = $12
- 2 pounds of honey: 2 * $10 = $20
- Total cost of one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, to find the profit per jar, we subtract the cost from the selling price:
- Profit per jar: $50 - $44 = $6

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
- Total profit: $6 * 10 = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of each type of coin:

- 32 quarters = 32 x $0.25 = $8
- 95 dimes = 95 x $0.10 = $9.50
- 120 nickels = 120 x $0.05 = $6
- 750 pennies = 750 x $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add the values together:
$8 + $9.50 = $17.50
$17.50 + $6 = $23.50
$23.50 + $7.50 = $31

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the amount her parents gave her.

Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 each for movie tickets for herself and her sister, and $8.50 on a bracelet. 

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on movie tickets: $7.50 + $7.50 = $15.

Now, we can add the cost of the ice cream and the total cost of the movie tickets: $3.50 + $15 = $18.50.

Finally, we add the cost of the bracelet to get the total amount spent: $18.50 + $8.50 = $27.

Janet's parents gave her $40.

Amount left = $40 - $27 = $13.

Janet has $13 left."
"To calculate Josh's earnings, we need to determine the number of days he is open and the number of cars he services in that time.

Josh is open 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). In 2 weeks, he is open 6 * 2 = 12 days.

Since he services 3 cars a day, in 12 days, he services 3 * 12 = 36 cars.

He gets paid $4 per car, so for 36 cars, he makes 36 * 4 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the total number of cookies Randy has now, we need to track the changes in each type of cookie.

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.

1. He eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This reduces his cookie count by 3:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

2. He eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. This reduces his oatmeal cookie count by 2:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (no change)
   - Sugar cookies: 4 (no change)

3. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. This reduces his sugar cookie count by 2:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 6 (no change)
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (no change)
   - Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

4. He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. This increases his cookie count by 8:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Randy now has 10 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 6 sugar cookies.

"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get from each half of his collection and add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can divide them into two equal groups of 6. 

For the first half (6 toys at $5 each), Matthew would earn: 6 * 5 = $30

For the second half (6 toys at $7 each), Matthew would earn: 6 * 7 = $42

Total amount Matthew would earn: $30 + $42 = $72

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many days it takes to fill them.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

To fill 84 holes, it will take:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

Final answer: 4"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School first.

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Let's calculate the number of chocolate chip cookies:

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P. According to the problem, we have the following equations:

T = 16/2 = 8 (Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested)
P = 14 + 2 = 16 (Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested)
B = 7 (Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers)

The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench is the sum of the items he gathered, which is T + B + P. We know that this total is 29, so we can set up the equation:

8 + 7 + P = 29

Now, we can solve for P:

P = 29 - 8 - 7
P = 14

However, we know that Igor gathered 16 Petri dishes, not 14. This means that he lost some beakers. To find out how many beakers he lost, we can subtract the number of beakers he had (7) from the number of beakers he gathered (16):

16 - 7 = 9

So, Igor lost 9 beakers.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws needed can be calculated as follows:

Total screws needed = Number of tables x Number of legs per table x Number of screws per leg
Total screws needed = 4 x 4 x 2
Total screws needed = 32

Since James has 40 screws, we can find the number of screws left over by subtracting the total screws needed from the total screws he has:

Screws left over = Total screws - Total screws needed
Screws left over = 40 - 32
Screws left over = 8

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket (10) to the number of eggs in the second basket (which is twice as many as the first basket, so 10 x 2 = 20).

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each person raised and then add them together.

Let's start by identifying the amount each person raised:

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative speed and distance. Let's denote Vanessa's speed as V miles per minute and Aaron's speed as A miles per minute. We know that Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's speed, so A = 2V.

We are given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and we need to find the time it took her to complete her part of the race. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and he ran 2 miles, we can find his speed: A = 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.

Now, we can find Vanessa's speed: V = A / 2 = (1/8) / 2 = 1/16 miles per minute.

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find the time it took her to complete her part of the race: Time = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: $\boxed{64}$"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we can start by calculating the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we can multiply the number of feet of dock by 3.

Total line required = 3 x 200
Total line required = 600 feet

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of line. To find the total amount of line he needs to buy, we need to subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required.

Total line needed = Total line required - line already available
Total line needed = 600 - 6
Total line needed = 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the total weekly revenue, we need to multiply the daily revenue by the number of days the restaurant is open. Since they get 6 reservations a night and each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine, the daily revenue is:

6 reservations * 2 meals per reservation * $5 per meal = $60
$60 + $5 (wine) = $65 per day

Since they are open 2 days a week, the weekly revenue is:

$65 per day * 2 days per week = $130 per week

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to calculate the cost per watermelon and then add a 25% profit.

The cost of 50 watermelons is $80. To find the cost per watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons:

Cost per watermelon = Total cost รท Number of watermelons
= $80 รท 50
= $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price with a 25% profit. To do this, we multiply the cost per watermelon by 1.25 (100% + 25% profit):

Selling price = Cost per watermelon ร 1.25
= $1.60 ร 1.25
= $2.00

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to determine the current age of John's youngest son first.

We know that John had a son James when he was 19 years old. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years. John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old, so John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference.

"To find the cost of the radiator, Mark gets 80% off the original price of $400.

First, calculate 80% of $400: 0.8 * $400 = $320. Then, subtract this amount from the original price: $400 - $320 = $80.

The labor cost for the mechanic is 3 hours * $50 per hour = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is $80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230.

Final answer: $230"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's say the number of chickens is x and the number of cows is 20 - x.

Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, the total number of legs can be represented by the equation:

2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x + 80 = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

This means that there are 5 chickens.

The final answer is 5."
