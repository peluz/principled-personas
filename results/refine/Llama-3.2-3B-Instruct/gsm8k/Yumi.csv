"Hello! I'm Yumi, a poultry expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast, leaving her with 16 - 3 = 13 eggs. Then, she bakes 4 eggs for her friends, resulting in 13 - 4 = 9 eggs available for sale.

To determine Janet's daily earnings, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a textile expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine the total number of bolts required, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fiber separately. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. Since it takes half that much white fiber, we can calculate it as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, let's add the amount of blue and white fiber to find the total:

Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
= 2 bolts + 1 bolt
= 3 bolts

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a real estate expert with extensive experience in property valuation and renovation analysis. I'd be happy to help you with Josh's house flipping scenario.

To calculate the profit, we need to determine the new value of the house after the repairs. Since the repairs increased the value by 150%, we can calculate the new value by multiplying the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase).

New value = $80,000 * 2.5
= $200,000

Now, we subtract the original price from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $120,000.

The final answer is: $120,000"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sports enthusiast and fitness expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total number of meters James runs per week, we need to multiply the number of sprints per week by the number of meters per sprint.

Total meters per week = 3 * 60
Total meters per week = 180

So, James runs 180 meters per week."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a poultry nutritionist. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens.

To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we need to calculate the total daily feed requirement and then subtract the feed already given.

First, let's calculate the total daily feed requirement. Since Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, we can multiply the number of chickens by the amount of feed per chicken.

Total daily feed requirement = 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

Since Wendi has already given the chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, we need to subtract those amounts from the total daily feed requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

Feed needed for the final meal = Total daily feed requirement - Feed already given
= 60 cups - (15 cups + 25 cups)
= 60 cups - 40 cups
= 20 cups

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sheep expert and agricultural specialist. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to follow the given information:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a network engineer with expertise in network performance optimization. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the total time it takes to download the file, we need to consider the interrupted download. Carla downloads 2 GB/minute for 80% of the file, which is 160 GB. 

Time taken for the first download = 160 GB / 2 GB/minute = 80 minutes.

Since the download is interrupted, we need to add the time taken for the restart, which is 20 minutes. Then, the download is restarted from the beginning.

Time taken for the second download = 80 minutes (same as the first download).

Total time taken = 80 minutes + 20 minutes + 80 minutes = 180 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation engineer with expertise in route optimization and traffic analysis. Let's break down John's journey to determine the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours.

To calculate the total distance, we need to consider the time spent in each segment of the journey.

1. John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

2. He spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move:
Distance = 0 miles

3. He drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

4. He drives for 2 hours at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles

Total distance traveled = 180 + 0 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles

Since John initially drove 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
Distance = Total distance traveled - Initial distance = 355 - 180 = 175 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down Eliza's earnings for the week.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a gardening expert with a focus on citrus cultivation. I'd be happy to help you determine how many years it'll take for Carlos to break even on his lemon tree investment.

To calculate the break-even point, we need to consider the initial cost of the tree, the annual income from lemons, and the annual expenses. Let's break it down:

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual income from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual expenses: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $7.50/year

To find the number of years it'll take to cover the initial cost, we can divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.50 (net profit per year) = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree.

Final answer: 12"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sales expert with extensive experience in door-to-door sales. I'd be happy to help you solve the problem.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more at the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she start with?

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as x.

She sold 1/3 of x at the green house, which is x/3. She sold 2 more at the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red house is x/3 + 2.

The number of vacuum cleaners remaining after selling at the green and red house is x - (x/3 + 2) = 2x/3 - 2.

She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/6 - 1.

The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is x/3 + 2 + x/6 - 1. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation: x - (x/3 + 2 + x/6 - 1) = 5.

To simplify the equation, we can find a common denominator, which is 6. Multiply the first term by 2/2 to get 2x/6. Now the equation becomes: 2x/6 - x/6 - 2 + 1 = 5.

Combine like terms: x/6 - 1 = 5.

Add 1 to both sides: x/6 = 6.

Multiply both sides by 6: x = 36.

The final answer is: 36"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a dance instructor with expertise in choreographing and teaching various dance styles. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students are enrolled in contemporary dance, we can calculate this as:

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

Now, we subtract the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students to find the number of students remaining:

Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Next, we need to find the number of students enrolled in jazz dance. Since 25% of the remaining students are enrolled in jazz dance, we can calculate this as:

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Finally, we subtract the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the number of students remaining to find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

Therefore, 60% of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

The final answer is 60."
"As a financial analyst, I've assessed the market trends and calculated the potential profit for both options. To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets.

The initial cost of the jewelry is $5,000, and it's expected to increase by 2.5% in the market. The potential value of the jewelry can be calculated as:

$5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

The initial cost of the electronic gadgets is $8,000, and it's expected to increase by 1.2% in the market. The potential value of the electronic gadgets can be calculated as:

$8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

To determine the best choice, we compare the potential values of both options. Since $8,160 is greater than $5,250, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets.

The profit from the electronic gadgets can be calculated as:

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
= $8,160 - $8,000
= $160

Therefore, the merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation engineer with expertise in route planning and analysis. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Since the two trains left San Rafael at the same time and traveled westward for 80 miles each, we can consider their initial positions as the same point. Then, they both traveled northward for 150 miles each.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

In this case, the distance traveled westward (80 miles) and the distance traveled northward (150 miles) form the two sides of a right-angled triangle. We can calculate the total distance covered by each train using the theorem:

√(80² + 150²) = √(6400 + 22500) = √26900 ≈ 164.58 miles

However, since the question asks for the distance covered by each train, we need to consider that they traveled the same distance. Therefore, we can simply add the distances traveled on both days:

80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you calculate Jill's annual salary.

To determine Jill's total annual earnings, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

- Hours worked per week: 35 hours
- Hourly wage: $20
- Weekly earnings: 35 hours * $20/hour = $700
- Annual earnings from teaching: $700 * 50 weeks = $35,000

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

- Hours worked per week: 15 hours
- Hourly wage: $30
- Weekly earnings: 15 hours * $30/hour = $450
- Annual earnings from coaching: $450 * 50 weeks = $22,500

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:

$35,000 (teaching) + $22,500 (coaching) = $57,500

The final answer is: $57,500"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a culinary expert with a focus on breakfast dishes. Today, I'm happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she consumes in that time frame. Since Claire makes 3 eggs per day, we can multiply this number by the number of days in 4 weeks.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 x 7 = 28 days. Multiply the number of eggs Claire makes per day (3) by the total number of days (28):

3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:

84 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is 7."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a hiking enthusiast and outdoor enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the speed Marissa needs to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we need to calculate the remaining distance and time she has left.

Marissa has already covered 4 + 2 = 6 miles in 2 hours. To find the remaining distance, we subtract the distance covered from the total distance:

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered
Remaining distance = 12 - 6
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Since Marissa wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time

We know the remaining distance (6 miles) and the desired average speed (4 miles per hour), so we can rearrange the formula to solve for time:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 6 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1.5 hours

Now that we know the remaining time, we can calculate the required speed to cover the remaining distance in 1.5 hours:

Required speed = Distance / Time
Required speed = 6 miles / 1.5 hours
Required speed = 4 miles per hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a beverage expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 10 liters of orange drink that is two-thirds water. To find the amount of water in this drink, we can multiply the total volume by the fraction representing the water content:

Water in orange drink = 10 liters * (2/3) = 20/3 liters

Next, we have 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. To find the amount of water in this drink, we can multiply the total volume by the fraction representing the water content:

Water in pineapple drink = 15 liters * (3/5) = 9 liters

Now, let's add the water content of both drinks to find the initial total amount of water:

Initial total water = Water in orange drink + Water in pineapple drink
= 20/3 + 9
= 9 + 20/3
= 49/3 liters

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract this from the initial total water:

Remaining water = Initial total water - 1 liter
= 49/3 - 1
= 49/3 - 3/3
= 46/3 liters

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

Remaining water = 46/3 ≈ 15.33 liters

The final answer is: 15.33"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a family historian. I've analyzed the information provided to determine the age difference between Raymond and Samantha.

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can calculate his current age by subtracting 6 from Samantha's age. 

Samantha's age: 31
Raymond's age: 31 - 6 = 25

Now, let's find the age difference between Raymond and his son. We know Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To determine how many years ago the son was born, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age.

25 (Raymond's current age) - 23 (son's age) = 2

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a candle connoisseur and expert in the field of wax melting rates. When it comes to calculating the amount of time a candle burns, we need to consider the duration of the burning period.

To determine the total number of centimeters the candle will melt, we can multiply the number of hours it burns by the rate of melting. In this case, the candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

The rate of melting is given as 2 centimeters per hour. So, we can calculate the total melting as follows:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Final answer: $\boxed{8}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a retail analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the original price of the book.

To find the original price, we can use the formula: Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage in decimal form).

In this case, the discounted price is $19.50 and the discount percentage is 25%. First, we need to convert the discount percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100.

Discount Percentage in decimal form = 25% = 0.25

Now, we can plug in the values into the formula:

Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
= $19.50 / 0.75
= $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items first. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a geography enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

Let's break it down step by step:

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip: 60 - 20 = 40 miles
Distance from the end of the trip to the second stop: 60 - 15 = 45 miles

However, since the second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip, we can also calculate the distance from the first stop to the second stop by adding the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop, and then subtracting the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

Distance from the first stop to the second stop: 20 + (60 - 15) = 20 + 45 = 65 miles

But wait, this is incorrect. We need to subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop from the total distance from the first stop to the end of the trip.

Distance from the first stop to the second stop: 60 - 45 = 15 miles

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fashion expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, which is $66. The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost five dollars less than the two pairs of heels, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship: 

B = 99 - 5

Where B is the cost of the boots.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

B = 94

So, the boots cost $94.

The final answer is 94."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into solving the problem at hand.

We're given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x, where x is a common multiplier. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: $\boxed{109}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the average guess, we need to calculate the number of jelly beans each person guessed and then add them together.

The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.

The third person guessed 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, let's add the guesses together: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses: 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a dog care expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total hours John spends taking care of his dogs.

To determine the total hours spent taking care of dogs per week, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day. Since each dog requires 0.5 hours of care, we can calculate the daily hours as follows:

10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per week, we multiply the daily hours by 7:

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of his dogs.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into solving the problem.

We're given that Gretchen has 110 coins in total, with 30 more gold coins than silver coins. To find the number of gold coins, we can set up an equation. Let's represent the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'.

The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold coins, which equals 110. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a jewelry expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Raymond has 40 jewels. To find out how many jewels Aaron has, we need to calculate half of Raymond's jewels and then add 5.

Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20
Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Now, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. We know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we subtract 2 from Aaron's total.

Siobhan's jewels = Aaron's jewels - 2
Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2
Siobhan's jewels = 23

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a ping pong enthusiast and coach. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately.

Points scored in the first 20 minutes = 4 points
Points scored in the second 20 minutes = 4 + (25% of 4)
= 4 + (0.25 * 4)
= 4 + 1
= 5 points

Total points scored = Points scored in the first 20 minutes + Points scored in the second 20 minutes
= 4 + 5
= 9 points

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a nutrition expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total cost of yogurts Terry eats over 30 days, we need to multiply the number of yogurts he consumes per day by the number of days and then multiply that result by the cost of one yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since the yogurts are on sale for 4 for $5, we need to find out how much one yogurt costs. 

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts = 15 sets of yogurts
Since each set costs $5, the cost of one yogurt is $5 / 4 = $1.25

Now, we can multiply the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days by the cost of one yogurt:
60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many Lego sets John still has, we need to determine the initial amount of money he had and then subtract the amount he spent on video games.

John sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets is 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, the amount he spent on video games and had left is $195 - $160 = $35.

Now, we know John had $40 initially and spent $35 on video games. To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we can divide the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets by the price of each set: 195 / 15 = 13.

However, we know he had 13 Lego sets initially. To find out how many Lego sets he still has, we need to subtract the number of Lego sets he sold from the initial number of Lego sets. Since he sold 13 Lego sets, he still has 13 - 13 = 0 Lego sets.

The correct answer is: 0"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sports enthusiast and running coach. I'd be happy to help you with John's running speed.

To calculate John's speed, we need to first find the total number of hours he runs in a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in total.

Now, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time. Speed is typically measured in miles per hour (mph). 

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 mph

The final answer is 10."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sports enthusiast and speed specialist. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts. Let's start by finding Dana's running speed and walking speed.

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, we can calculate her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. This gives us:

Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
= 2 * 3 miles/hour
= 6 miles/hour

Now that we have Dana's running speed, we can calculate the distance she travels while running. Since she spends one-third of the time running, we can multiply her running speed by the time she spends running (2 hours):

Distance traveled while running = Running speed * Time spent running
= 6 miles/hour * 2 hours
= 12 miles

Next, we need to calculate the distance Dana travels while walking. Since she spends two-thirds of the time walking, we can multiply her walking speed (which is half of her running speed) by the time she spends walking (2 hours):

Walking speed = 1/2 * Running speed
= 1/2 * 6 miles/hour
= 3 miles/hour

Distance traveled while walking = Walking speed * Time spent walking
= 3 miles/hour * 2 hours
= 6 miles

Finally, we can calculate the total distance Dana travels in six hours by adding the distance she travels while running and walking:

Total distance = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking
= 12 miles + 6 miles
= 18 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a tech enthusiast and iPhone expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows:

Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Now, we're told that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's. To find Brandon's iPhone age, we can multiply Ben's iPhone age by 4:

Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"Greetings, I'm Yumi, a skilled warrior and strategist. I've studied the art of javelin throwing and dragon combat. To determine the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone, we need to calculate the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone is three times her throwing distance without the gemstone. Let's denote the throwing distance without the gemstone as x. Then, the throwing distance with the gemstone is 3x.

We know that the dragon's range is 1000 feet. To find the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames, we need to subtract the dragon's range from the throwing distance with the gemstone: 3x - 1000.

Since we know the throwing distance without the gemstone is 400 feet, we can set up the equation: 3x = 400. Solving for x, we get x = 400 / 3.

Now, we can calculate the throwing distance with the gemstone: 3x = 3 * (400 / 3) = 400.

Finally, we subtract the dragon's range from the throwing distance with the gemstone: 400 - 1000 = -600. However, this is not a feasible solution, as distance cannot be negative. This indicates that Polly cannot throw the javelin far enough to stand outside the dragon's reach while holding the gemstone.

The correct answer is that Polly cannot stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's solve the problem step by step.

To find the number of pieces taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out. 

First, we know that Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces initially set out is 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces.

Next, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out. The remaining pieces are 14.

Number of pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially set out - Remaining pieces
= 40 - 14
= 26

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a nutrition expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first calculate the remaining calories in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left

Since each serving has 250 calories, we need to divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have.

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 300g, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving to find the total weight.

0.8 * 300 = 240g

So, you can eat 240g of chips."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a candle expert with extensive knowledge of the candle-making industry. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate Charlie's net profit, we need to consider the cost of materials and the selling price of the candles. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of materials. Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax and the cost of one pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00, the total cost of materials for 20 candles is:

Total cost = (Number of pounds of beeswax) * (Cost per pound of beeswax and wicks)
Total cost = 1 pound * $10.00
Total cost = $10.00

However, since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, he actually used 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. So, the correct total cost is:

Total cost = (2 pounds) * (Cost per pound of beeswax and wicks)
Total cost = 2 pounds * $10.00
Total cost = $20.00

Now, let's calculate the total revenue:

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle
Total revenue = $40.00

Finally, we can calculate the net profit:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a freelance blogger specializing in health topics. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total hours Meredith spent writing articles.

To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of hours she spent on each day.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. She wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, so on Wednesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she spent on each day: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{104}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a data analyst with expertise in mathematical modeling and problem-solving. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse and used 220 notes at work. To find the total number of notes she had initially, we can simply add these two numbers together:

80 (initial notes) + 220 (notes used at work) = 300

However, we're told that she had 23 notes remaining overall. This means that the total number of notes she had initially must be 300 + 23 = 323.

Since we know that Candice initially had 80 notes in her purse, the number of notes in the package she purchased can be found by subtracting the initial notes from the total:

323 (total notes) - 80 (initial notes) = 243

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 243.

The final answer is: 243"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fashion expert with a keen eye for accessories. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total amount spent on ties, we need to first determine the cost of a red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we can calculate the cost of a red tie as follows:

Cost of a red tie = Cost of a blue tie + (50% of the cost of a blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 x $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we know the cost of a red tie is $60. Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 x Number of blue ties
= 2 x 5
= 10

The total amount spent on red ties is:
10 x $60
= $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:
Total amount spent = $200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties)
= $800

The final answer is: $800"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a building management expert. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to first calculate the total number of units and then determine the number of occupied units.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. So, the total number of units is:

Total units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can find the number of occupied units by multiplying the total units by 3/4.

Occupied units = Total units * 3/4
Occupied units = 120 * 3/4
Occupied units = 90

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total units.

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Unoccupied units = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a poultry expert with extensive experience in egg production and sales. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate Lloyd's weekly earnings from egg sales, we need to first determine the number of eggs he sells per week. Since his chickens produce 252 eggs per day, we can multiply this number by 7 to get the total number of eggs per week.

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens:

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Now, we can calculate Lloyd's weekly earnings by multiplying the number of dozens by the price per dozen:

147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

Therefore, Lloyd makes $294 per week from egg sales.

The final answer is: $294"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a navigation expert with extensive experience in calculating travel times and distances. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Since Tom is sailing at 10 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 mph x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to get back.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Uriah's book bag is getting too heavy, and he needs to remove 15 pounds. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each, and his toys weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove.

First, let's calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * (1/4) = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove:

7.5 ÷ 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: 15"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a mechanic with extensive experience in tire repair. Let's break down the revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. To calculate the total revenue, we need to multiply the number of tires by the respective rates and add them together.

Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. We can calculate the total revenue as follows:

Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
Total revenue on Friday: $480

Comparing the revenues, Friday's revenue ($480) is less than Thursday's revenue ($520). To find the difference, we subtract the smaller revenue from the larger revenue: $520 - $480 = $40.

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday than on Friday.

Patchy's kittens = 3 * 12
Patchy's kittens = 36

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 

Total kittens = Patchy's kittens + Trixie's kittens
Total kittens = 36 + 12
Total kittens = 48

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a structural engineer specializing in bridge design and load calculations. I'd be happy to help you determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck.

To find the maximum number of boxes, we need to calculate the available weight for the boxes. We'll start by subtracting the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds

Available weight for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can calculate the maximum number of boxes as follows:

Maximum number of boxes = Available weight for boxes / Weight of a single box
= 245 pounds / 15 pounds
= 16.33

Since we can't load a fraction of a box, we'll round down to the nearest whole number to ensure the truck doesn't exceed the bridge's weight limit.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a pension expert with 10 years of experience in calculating pension benefits. I'd be happy to help you with Marcy's pension calculation.

To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break down her benefits into two periods: the first 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

In the first 20 years, Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000.

The total amount she receives in the first 20 years is:
$50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000

After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension is $1,000,000. So, her annual pension after 20 years is:
$1,000,000 * 5% = $50,000

Since she quits after 30 years, she receives the fixed annual pension for 10 years and the 5% annual pension for 10 years.

The total amount she receives in the remaining 10 years is:
$50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000
$50,000/year * 5% = $2,500/year * 10 years = $25,000
Total amount = $500,000 + $25,000 = $525,000

Now, we add the total amount she received in the first 20 years and the total amount she received in the remaining 10 years:
$1,000,000 + $525,000 = $1,525,000

To find the average annual pension, we divide the total amount by the total number of years:
$1,525,000 / 30 years = $50,833.33

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst with expertise in calculating subscription fees. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in a half year, she paid:
140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. 10% of $140 is:
140 * 0.1 = $14
So, the amount she paid for the second half of the year is:
140 - 14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, she paid:
126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fuel efficiency expert. Let's dive into calculating how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas.

To determine the miles per gallon (mpg) for Sophia's car, we need to divide the total distance she's traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas used to fill her tank (4 gallons).

mpg = Total Distance ÷ Total Gas Used
mpg = 100 miles ÷ 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

However, we're asked to find out how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, which is the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons). To do this, we can divide the total capacity by the mpg.

Distance = Total Capacity × mpg
Distance = 12 gallons × 25 miles/gallon
Distance = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive approximately 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

The final answer is: 300"

"Treasure hunter's dilemma, a classic problem of gemstone proportions. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that the number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds. If we denote the number of diamonds as D, we can express the number of rubies as D - 35.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so we can express the number of emeralds as 2(D - 35).

Now, we're given that the total number of gems is the sum of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. We can write this as:

D + (D - 35) + 2(D - 35) = Total number of gems

Combine like terms:

D + D - 35 + 2D - 70 = Total number of gems

Simplify:

4D - 105 = Total number of gems

Now, we're told that the number of diamonds is 175. We can substitute this value into the equation:

4(175) - 105 = Total number of gems

Calculate:

700 - 105 = Total number of gems

595 = Total number of gems

The final answer is: 595"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast and educator. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls. To find the number of boys, we can multiply the number of girls by 2.

Number of boys = 2 * 60
Number of boys = 120

Now, we need to find the total number of students. We can do this by adding the number of boys and girls.

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Since there are 5 students per teacher, we can divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers.

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.

The final answer is 36."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Bailey starts with an unknown amount of money. She receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. At the end of the 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. We need to find out how much money Bailey started with.

Let's denote the initial amount of money as x. Since Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, the total amount of her allowance is 5 * 8 = $40.

The total amount Bailey has at the end of 8 weeks is the sum of the initial amount and the total allowance. We know this total is $100. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 40 = 100

To find the initial amount, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a dance instructor with expertise in teaching various dance styles. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate Judy's weekly earnings, we need to first determine the total number of classes she teaches in a week. She teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, which is a total of 5 * 5 = 25 classes. Additionally, she teaches 8 classes on Saturday.

Total classes in a week = 25 (weekdays) + 8 (Saturday) = 33 classes

Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students is 33 * 15 = 495.

Judy charges $15 per student, so her total weekly earnings can be calculated as:

Total weekly earnings = Total number of students * Charge per student
= 495 * $15
= $7425

Therefore, Judy makes $7425 in a week.

The final answer is: $7425"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a veterinarian with expertise in animal nutrition. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the number of dog food bags Cecilia will need for her puppy.

To determine the total number of bags of dog food needed, we need to calculate the amount of food used in the first 180 days and the amount used for the rest of the year.

For the first 180 days, Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food used in the first 180 days is:

1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

For the rest of the year (365 - 180 = 185 days), Cecilia feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food used in the rest of the year is:

2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

The total amount of food used in the first year is:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags used in the first year is:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a laundry expert with years of experience in managing household chores. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David, we need to first determine the amount of laundry each person does.

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can set up an equation:

Let's say David's laundry is x. Then, Sarah's laundry is 4x.

We know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so we can set up the equation:

4x = 400

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 400 / 4
x = 100

So, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can calculate his laundry as follows:

Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sports analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the football team played a total of 22 games. We also know that they won 8 more games than they lost. Let's use algebra to represent the number of games lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as 'x + 8'.

The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and lost, which is equal to 22. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by adding 8 to x:
x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

The final answer is 15."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst with expertise in salary calculations. I'd be happy to help you with Sylvie's salary after three more years of service.

To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the increase in her salary for each year.

Year 1:
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

Year 8:
Increase = 10% of $1169.23 = 0.1 * $1169.23 = $116.923
Salary after 8 years = $1169.23 + $116.923 = $1286.153

Year 9:
Increase = 10% of $1286.153 = 0.1 * $1286.153 = $128.6153
Salary after 9 years = $1286.153 + $128.6153 = $1414.7683

Marcia's pets = 4 + 2
Marcia's pets = 6

Now, we know Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. So, we can calculate Jan's pets as follows:

Jan's pets = 3 * Marcia's pets
Jan's pets = 3 * 6
Jan's pets = 18

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has:

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a neighborhood pet enthusiast and animal behaviorist. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. We also know that there are two cats for every dog. Since there are 60 dogs, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we can find the combined number of dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Since the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

To find the total number of pets, we simply add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a culinary expert with a focus on sauce preparation. When it comes to cooking with canned tomatoes, I always consider the volume and weight of the tomatoes to ensure the best results.

In this case, we're given that Freda's canned tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked into sauce. This means that the 32 ounces of sauce she made is equivalent to the weight of 64 ounces of raw tomatoes (since it's half the volume). To find the number of tomatoes used, we can divide the total ounces of tomatoes by the weight of a single can.

Let's calculate the number of tomatoes used:

Total ounces of tomatoes = 64 ounces
Weight of a single can = 16 ounces

Number of tomatoes used = Total ounces of tomatoes / Weight of a single can
= 64 / 16
= 4

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans used by 3 to find the total number of tomatoes used.

Number of tomatoes used = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes/can
= 12 tomatoes

The final answer is 12."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the total number of cars is 30, and 5 cars took an exit. So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as x. We can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

x = 25 - 20
x = 5

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

On weekdays, John drinks 3 glasses of water (1 for breakfast, 1 for lunch, and 1 for dinner) and 1 glass before bed, making a total of 5 glasses per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 5 * 5 = 25 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 2 glasses of water (1 for breakfast and 1 before bed), so he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 25 + 4 = 29.

The final answer is: 29"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a meteorologist specializing in fog behavior. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the time it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to calculate the total time it takes to cover the distance. Since the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, we can use the formula:

Time = Total Distance / Rate

Given that the city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, we can plug in the values as follows:

Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes

Time = 42 / 3
Time = 14 minutes

Therefore, it will take 14 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

Final answer: 14"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a puzzle enthusiast and expert in jigsaw puzzle solving. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the number of pieces left, let's break it down step by step:

Poppy starts with 1000 pieces. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, which is 1000 * 1/4 = 250 pieces.

The remaining pieces are 1000 - 250 = 750.

Next, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. To find a third of 750, we can divide by 3: 750 ÷ 3 = 250 pieces.

Now, we subtract the pieces placed by her mom from the remaining pieces: 750 - 250 = 500.

Therefore, there are 500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{500}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's calculate Cody's cookies: 3 x 5 = 15 cookies.

Now, we add the number of cookies eaten by Amir and Cody: 5 (Amir) + 15 (Cody) = 20 cookies.

The final answer is: 20"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a materials engineer with expertise in 3D modeling and spatial analysis. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total inner volume of the boxes.

To find the inner volume of one box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the outer dimensions. The outer dimensions are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick.

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length x Width x Height = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total Volume = 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a TV show enthusiast and time management expert. Let's break down Frankie's TV watching habits to determine how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday.

First, we need to calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total time watched on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

To find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is equal to 90 minutes.

Now, we divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes to get the number of episodes. 90 / 30 = 3.

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a baking enthusiast and expert in cookie confectionery. I'd be delighted to help you solve this problem.

Let's break down the situation step by step. Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. If we denote the number of cookies he baked last year as x, then this year he bakes 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually bakes 2x + 15 cookies. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left, which simplifies to 2x + 10.

We know that he has a total of 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

To solve for x, we subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fuel efficiency expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards.

To determine the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The total cost of gas can be calculated by multiplying the number of gallons by the price per gallon:

Total cost of gas = Number of gallons * Price per gallon
Total cost of gas = 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback amount can be calculated by multiplying the number of gallons by the cashback per gallon:

Cashback amount = Number of gallons * Cashback per gallon
Cashback amount = 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon
Cashback amount = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback amount from the total cost of gas to get the final cost:

Total cost after cashback = Total cost of gas - Cashback amount
Total cost after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00
Total cost after cashback = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards will be $28.00."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to multiply the width by the length for each person.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 * 24 = 48
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 * 14 = 42

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can divide the total by 2 to find the average number of roll-ups eaten.

Average number of roll-ups eaten: 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a marine engineer specializing in boat design and operations. I'd be happy to help you with Julia's situation.

To determine the amount of water Julia's boat took on, we need to calculate the rate at which the boat is taking on water and then multiply it by the total distance she rows.

First, let's find Julia's rowing speed. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. We can calculate her speed as follows:

Speed = Distance / Time
= 20 feet / 16 seconds
= 1.25 feet/second

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can find the rate at which the boat takes on water as follows:

Rate of water intake = 2 liters / 10 feet
= 0.2 liters/foot

Now, we can find the total distance Julia rows to reach the shore:

Distance = Speed * Time
= 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds
= 80 feet

Finally, we can find the total amount of water taken on by the boat:

Total water taken on = Rate of water intake * Distance
= 0.2 liters/foot * 80 feet
= 16 liters

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a wildlife photographer and enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, and it's 6 times more than Brittany's phone. To find the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold, we can divide 1800 by 6.

Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

Now, we're told that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. To find the number of ducks, we can divide 300 by 50.

300 / 50 = 6

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

The final answer is: 6"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a carpentry expert with extensive experience in managing lumber inventory and pricing. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

Now, we add the total cost of both types of boards: $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, we need to calculate the new selling price for each type of board. For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the new selling price is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board. For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the new selling price is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.

We also calculate the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

Finally, we add the total revenue from both types of boards: $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a coffee connoisseur and expert in coffee-to-water ratios. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to find the value of one part of the ratio. The total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20.

Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can divide 120 by 7 to find the value of one part:

120 ÷ 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Now, we multiply this value by 7 to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used:

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a logistics expert with extensive experience in managing container shipments. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each on the first day, so the total number of vehicles already present at the port is:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of vehicles added, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst with expertise in salary calculations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find Adrien's current salary, we need to calculate 30% of his old salary and add it to his old salary.

30% of $40,000 = 0.3 * $40,000 = $12,000
Adrien's current salary = $40,000 + $12,000 = $52,000

Next, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation:

$40,000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769.23

Now, we need to find Lylah's current salary. Since her salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate 40% of her old salary and add it to her old salary.

40% of $30,769.23 = 0.4 * $30,769.23 = $12,307.69
Lylah's current salary = $30,769.23 + $12,307.69 = $43,076.92

Finally, we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their current salaries.

Total salary = Adrien's current salary + Lylah's current salary
Total salary = $52,000 + $43,076.92
Total salary = $95,076.92

The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is $95,076.92."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a graphic designer with expertise in paper usage calculations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he uses in a month. Since he uses 2 pads of paper per week, we can start by multiplying the number of pads per week by the number of weeks in a month.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, we multiply 2 pads/week by 4 weeks/month:

2 pads/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 pads/month

Since there are 30 sheets of paper in a pad, we multiply the number of pads per month by the number of sheets per pad:

8 pads/month * 30 sheets/pad = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

First, let's calculate the distance covered at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
= 30 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance covered at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 5 miles/hour x 4 hours

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a postal expert with extensive knowledge of mail processing and logistics. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps, and she puts stamps on one-third of them. To find out how many letters were stamped, we can divide the total number of letters needing stamps by 3.

Number of letters stamped = Total letters needing stamps / 3
= 60 / 3
= 20

Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find the number of letters in the pile when Jennie began, we need to add the number of letters she stamped to the number of letters in the pile now.

Number of letters in the pile when Jenni began = Number of letters in the pile now + Number of letters stamped
= 30 + 20
= 50

The final answer is 50."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a healthcare consultant with expertise in hospital operations and financial analysis. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the profit, we need to consider the total revenue and total costs. The hospital sees 500 patients a day, with each patient being seen for an average of 24 minutes. We'll convert the total time to hours for easier calculation.

Total time spent on patients: 
500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour and the doctors $150 an hour. We'll calculate the total revenue from patients and doctors separately.

Total revenue from patients:
500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000

Total revenue from doctors:
200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

Total revenue: $100,000 + $30,000 = $130,000

Since there are no other costs mentioned, the total cost is $0.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, and I'd be happy to help you with your delivery order calculation.

To calculate the total cost of Rory's order, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the cost of each item:

- 2 subs at $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies at $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of the items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost. To find 20% of $20.00, we can multiply $20.00 by 0.20.

$20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the total cost: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

To determine the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed and subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test, Mark completed 5 questions per hour for 8 hours, so he completed 5 * 8 = 40 questions.

For the second test, Mark completed 5 questions per hour for 6 hours, so he completed 5 * 6 = 30 questions.

In total, Mark completed 40 + 30 = 70 questions.

Since the first test had 75 questions and Mark completed 70, he left 75 - 70 = 5 questions incomplete.

The final answer is 5."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a candy connoisseur and expert in gumball dynamics. I'd be delighted to help you with your question.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. We're given that there are 12 blue gumballs. To find the number of pink gumballs, we can use the following equation:

Number of pink gumballs = 4 * Number of blue gumballs + 22
= 4 * 12 + 22
= 48 + 22
= 70

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation expert with a focus on vehicle analysis. I'd be happy to help you determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars among the available fleet.

To calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first find the number of semi-automatic cars. We know that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. The remaining cars are semi-automatic.

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a bee enthusiast and apiarist. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break down the information given:

We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700. We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and there are twice as many babies as queens.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q. Since there are twice as many babies as queens, the number of babies is 2Q. And since there are twice as many worker bees as babies, the number of worker bees is 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

We can set up the equation: Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combining like terms, we get: 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we find: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of worker bees: 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400.

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate Jordan's potential earnings if he spent his video game time working, we need to determine the total hours he would work in a week. Since he plays video games for 2 hours every day, we can multiply the number of hours he plays per day by the number of days in a week.

Total hours worked in a week = 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

Since Jordan earns $10 an hour, we can multiply the total hours worked by his hourly wage to find his total earnings.

Total earnings = Total hours worked * Hourly wage
= 14 hours/week * $10/hour
= $140/week

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working, he would earn $140 in a week.

Final answer: $140"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a personal finance expert. Let's break down the costs of John's purchases.

To calculate the total cost, we need to find the total cost of non-food items and add the cost of food items. Non-food items include light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total non-food items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Tax on non-food items: 10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

Total cost of non-food items with tax: $10 + $1 = $11

Food items: 
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total food items: $2 + $3 = $5

Total cost of everything: $11 (non-food items) + $5 (food items) = $16

The total cost of John's purchases is $16."
"As a financial analyst, I've reviewed Kim's business plan and calculated the profit based on the given information.

To determine the total expenses, we need to calculate the cost of bleach and cloths for all 8 clients. 

The cost of bleach is 16 bottles * $2 per bottle, which equals $32. 
The cost of cloths is 8 packs * $5 per pack, which equals $40.

Total expenses = $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a horticulturist specializing in tropical fruit cultivation. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per year and then divide it by the frequency of harvesting.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples per year:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples/year

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to multiply the total number of pineapples per year by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year):
1000 pineapples/year * 4 = 4000 pineapples/year

So, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.
The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first box, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box:
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

The final answer is: $\boxed{2125}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a bee enthusiast and apiarist. I'm excited to help you solve this problem.

To determine the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours, let's break down the events:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, 2 times as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. The total number of bees that left before the last 6 hours is 30 + 60 = 90 bees.
5. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return to the hive. Since 15 bees returned in the previous 6 hours, 90 - 15 = 75 bees return in the last 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a museum enthusiast and expert in ticket pricing. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is:
$12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, she must have given the cashier $22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a social media analyst. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. To find out how many friends Dorothy has, we can divide Charlie's friends by 3.

Dorothy's friends = Charlie's friends / 3
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4.

James' friends = Dorothy's friends * 4
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"To determine the time Tim will be waiting for Steve, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to get home and then find the difference between their times.

Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is equivalent to 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet. His speed is 440 feet per minute, so his time is 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is equivalent to 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet. His speed is 264 feet per minute, so his time is 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

Since Steve finishes first, we need to find the time Tim will be waiting for Steve. This is the difference between their times: 40 - 36 = 4 minutes.

To determine the total amount of money made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire. Let's break it down:

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = $5.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a food scientist specializing in snack food dynamics. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

To determine the original number of french fries in the pack, let's break down the events that occurred:

1. A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, leaving 1/3 of the original amount. If we let x be the original amount, then 1/3 of x is 5. So, x = 5 * 3 = 15.
2. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total. The remaining fries after the pigeons ate 9 fries is 15 - 9 = 6.
3. A seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. The remaining fries after the seagull ate 7 fries is 6 - 7 = -1.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a student counselor at a local college. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to break down his class schedule by day and then multiply the number of hours per day by the number of days in a week. 

Kimo has three 1-hour classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, which amounts to 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 days, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each, so he spends 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 days, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to add the hours spent on each type of day. So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 9 * 16 = 144 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 8 * 16 = 128 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

The total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{272}$"
"Bonjour! As a French patisserie expert, I'd be delighted to help you with this problem.

To calculate the total length of the baked goods, we need to convert each type of baked good to feet and then add them together.

First, let's convert the rolls to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can divide the number of rolls by 12:
300 rolls * 4 inches/roll / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

Next, let's convert the chocolate croissants to feet:
120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

Now, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes:
60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Finally, we add the lengths of all the baked goods together:
10 feet (rolls) + 10 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 140 feet

The total length of the baked goods is 140 feet.

The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas required:
400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas.

To ensure we have enough bananas for the next 2 months, I recommend ordering 1400 bananas."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sports enthusiast and athletic coach. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine the winner of the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran. Let's break it down step by step.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. Since he's running back and forth, we need to multiply the distance by 2 (to account for the return trip). So, Blake's total distance is 15 * 2 * 100 yards = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so her total distance is 34 * (100 + 80) yards = 34 * 180 yards = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is greater than 3000 yards, Kelly wins.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 6120 - 3000 = 3120 yards.

The final answer is: 3120"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's calculate the total cost of Raphael's school supplies.

To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 4 pens is 4 x $1.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 notebooks is 2 x $4 = $8.
The cost of the bond paper is $20.

Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a herpetologist specializing in aquatic amphibians. Let's break down the situation:

Finn initially observed 11 tadpoles in the pond. Then, 6 of them emerged from under a lily pad, and 2 of them hid under a rock. To determine the number of tadpoles Finn can see now, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the total number of tadpoles initially.

Let's calculate:

Initial number of tadpoles = 11
Number of tadpoles that emerged = 6
Number of tadpoles that hid = 2

Number of tadpoles Finn can see = Initial number of tadpoles - Number of tadpoles that hid
= 11 - 2
= 9

Therefore, Finn can see 9 tadpoles in the pond now.

Final answer: 9"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a water management specialist. I'd be happy to help you with the tank's water depth.

To find the water depth on Wednesday, let's break it down step by step:

1. The tank initially had 17 feet of water on Monday.
2. On Tuesday, 7 feet more water was added, making the depth 17 + 7 = 24 feet.
3. On Wednesday, the water depth is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find this, we multiply 24 feet by 2/3.

To calculate two thirds of 24 feet, we can use the formula: (2/3) * 24 = 16 feet.

Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

Final answer: The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a marine biologist. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Total number of fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst with expertise in calculating price increases over time. I'd be happy to help you determine the price of a bag of marbles after 36 months, considering a 20% increase every two months.

To calculate the price after 36 months, we can break it down into smaller intervals:

Initial price = $20
Increase after 2 months = 20% of $20 = $4
Price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Increase after 4 months = 20% of $24 = $4.80
Price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

We can continue this pattern to find the price after 36 months:

Increase after 6 months = 20% of $28.80 = $5.76
Price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Increase after 8 months = 20% of $34.56 = $6.91
Price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47

Increase after 10 months = 20% of $41.47 = $8.29
Price after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76

Increase after 12 months = 20% of $49.76 = $9.95
Price after 12 months = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71

Increase after 14 months = 20% of $59.71 = $11.94
Price after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65

Increase after 16 months = 20% of $71.65 = $14.33
Price after 16 months = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98

Increase after 18 months = 20% of $85.98 = $17.20
Price after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18

Increase after 20 months = 20% of $103.18 = $20.64
Price after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82

Increase after 22 months = 20% of $123.82 = $24.76
Price after 22 months = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58

Increase after 24 months = 20% of $148.58 = $29.72
Price after 24 months = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30

Increase after 26 months = 20% of $178.30 = $35.66
Price after 26 months = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96

Increase after 28 months = 20% of $213.96 = $42.79
Price after 28 months = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75

Increase after 30 months = 20% of $256.75 = $51.55
Price after 30 months = $256.75 + $51.55 = $308.30

Increase after 32 months = 20% of $308.30 = $61.66
Price after 32 months = $308.30 + $61.66 = $369.96

Increase after 34 months = 20% of $369.96 = $73.99
Price after 34 months = $369.96 + $73.99 = $443.95

Increase after 36 months = 20% of $443.95 = $88.79
Price after 36 months = $443.95 + $88.79 = $532.74

The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $532.74."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a toy valuation expert. I'd be happy to help you determine the total value of the toys in the room.

To calculate the total value, we need to establish the cost of each item relative to the others. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so we can express this as an equation: D = 3A, where D is the cost of the doll and A is the cost of an action figure.

We also know that one red car costs $4, so we can express this as R = $4.

Given that the cost of an action figure is $5, we can substitute this value into the equation D = 3A to find the cost of the doll:
D = 3 * $5
D = $15

Now, we can find the cost of a red car:
R = $4

Next, we can calculate the total cost of all toys:
Total cost = (5 red cars * $4) + (3 action figures * $5) + (1 doll * $15)
Total cost = (5 * $4) + (3 * $5) + $15
Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15
Total cost = $50

The final answer is: $50"
"As a financial analyst, I'd be happy to help Jackie make an informed decision about whether to do her taxes herself or hire an accountant.

To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, which would result in a loss of $35/hour. So, the total loss would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the total loss:

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

Final answer: $15"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down Elvira's budget for her 30th birthday.

Elvira has a budget of €1500 for computer accessories and some extra money for clothing. She buys a computer with a screen, keyboard, and mouse for €1090, a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102.

To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the accessories. 

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102
Total cost = €1423

Now, let's subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

The final answer is: €77"
"To determine the number of times Sandra needs to babysit, we can divide the total number of eggs required (15) by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting (3).

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into solving the problem step by step.

We're given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. If we represent Seth's current age as 'x', then Brooke's current age would be 'x/2'. In two years, their ages will be 'x + 2' and 'x/2 + 2', respectively. The sum of their ages in two years is 28. We can set up the equation:

x + 2 + x/2 + 2 = 28

To simplify, let's first combine like terms:

(3x/2) + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3x/2 = 24

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

So, Seth's current age is 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has and then add $2.

Ethel has $8. Twice the amount of money Ethel has is 2 x $8 = $16.

Jimmy has $2 more than twice the amount of money Ethel has, so Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18.

The final answer is $18."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fitness enthusiast and walking expert. I'd be happy to help you with calculating Pancho's weekly walking distance.

To determine the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking habits. On weekdays, he walks 20 miles, and on weekends, he walks 10 miles. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.

Let's calculate the total miles walked on weekdays: 5 days * 20 miles/day = 100 miles
Now, let's calculate the total miles walked on weekends: 2 days * 10 miles/day = 20 miles
To find the total miles walked in a week, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fashion merchandising expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of each uniform.

To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants. 

The hat costs $25. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 x $25 = $75. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
$25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

The final answer is: $150."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a wildlife enthusiast and ornithologist. I'm here to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all four birds: 8 (Sally Thirty-two) + 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51.

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down Jessica's debt repayment plan.

To calculate the total monthly payment, we need to add up the minimum payments for her student loans, credit card, and mortgage.

Minimum payment for student loans: $300
Minimum payment for credit card: $200
Minimum payment for mortgage: $500
Total minimum payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment.

50% of $1000 = 0.5 x $1000 = $500

Now, let's add the 50% increase to the total minimum payment:
$1000 + $500 = $1500

This is the amount Jessica pays per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply this amount by 12.

$1500 x 12 = $18,000

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a culinary expert with extensive experience in food preparation and kitchen management. Today, I'll be happy to help you with calculating the time it takes Billy to prepare the potatoes for his family reunion barbecue.

To determine the total time required, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato. Since the potatoes are roughly the same size, we can assume it takes the same amount of time to peel and cut each one.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, let's convert the time to cut one potato to minutes: 5 seconds = 5/60 = 0.0833 minutes

Now, we can calculate the total time to prepare one potato: 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes = 1.5833 minutes

Since there are 60 potatoes, we multiply the total time to prepare one potato by the number of potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5833 minutes/potato = 94.999 minutes

To convert the total time to seconds, we multiply by 60: 94.999 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 5699.94 seconds

So, it will take Billy approximately 5699.94 seconds to finish prepping the potatoes.

Final answer: $\boxed{5699.94}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst with expertise in cost-benefit analysis. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much Juan and his brother Carlos spent on lemons, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, we know they sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and profit is the difference between revenue and cost, we can set up an equation:

Revenue - Cost = Profit
$10 - Cost = $25

To find the total cost, we can add $25 to both sides of the equation:
$10 + $25 = $35

This is the total cost for 1 gallon. Since they need lemons and sugar for each gallon, the cost of lemons and sugar for 1 gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

To find the total cost of lemons, we can divide the total cost by 1 gallon:
$35 ÷ 1 gallon = $35 per gallon

Since they need lemons for 1 gallon, the cost of lemons is $35.

The final answer is: $35"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a demographer with expertise in population analysis. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine the number of Chinese girls on the team, we need to first find the total number of Chinese participants. We know that the total number of Asians is 240, and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the number of Chinese participants can be calculated as follows:

Number of Chinese = Total number of Asians - Number of Japanese
= 240 - 80
= 160

Now, we are given that the number of Chinese boys is 60. To find the number of Chinese girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

Number of Chinese girls = Total number of Chinese - Number of Chinese boys
= 160 - 60
= 100

Therefore, there are 100 Chinese girls on the team.

The final answer is 100."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down Zaid's expenses and calculate how much he has left.

To find out how much Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations, we need to calculate the amount he spends and subtract it from his total income.

Zaid's monthly income is $6000.

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * $6000 = $1500.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * $6000 = $2000.

The total amount spent so far is $1500 + $2000 = $3500.

The remaining amount is $6000 - $3500 = $2500.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * $2500 = $1250.

The amount left after donation is $2500 - $1250 = $1250.

He gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700, so the total amount spent on these is $200 + $700 = $900.

The amount left after these expenses is $1250 - $900 = $350.

Therefore, Zaid will have $350 left after all these expenses and donations.

The final answer is: $350"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a marine biologist specializing in crustacean populations. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, we can calculate Monic's crab count as follows:

Monic's crabs = Bo's crabs - 4
Monic's crabs = 40 - 4
Monic's crabs = 36

Now, we're told that Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. So, we can calculate Rani's crab count as follows:

Rani's crabs = Monic's crabs + 10
Rani's crabs = 36 + 10
Rani's crabs = 46

To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we simply add up their individual counts:

Total crabs = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs
Total crabs = 40 + 36 + 46
Total crabs = 122

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a floristry expert with extensive experience in flower arrangement and order fulfillment. I'd be happy to help you with this situation.

To determine the number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm, we need to establish the relationship between the number of white carnations and red roses. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can represent this as:

Number of red roses = 4 * Number of white carnations

We also know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as x. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

Given that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, we can set up the equation:

5x = 200

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses:

Number of red roses = 4 * x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

Final answer: 160"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We're given that Jan is 30 years old. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. To find Mark's current age, we need to calculate half of Jan's age two years ago and add 5 to it.

Half of Jan's age two years ago is 30 / 2 = 15. Then, we add 5 to get Mark's age two years ago: 15 + 5 = 20.

Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so his current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years old.

Now, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark. To find Jean's age, we simply add 2 to Mark's age: 22 + 2 = 24.

Therefore, Jean is 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a track and field enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together. 

The first runner runs 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team's time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a probability expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (6).

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes (2, 4, and 6) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (6).

Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = (2/6) * (2/6) = 4/36 = 1/9 = 0.1111

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities and express it as a percentage.

Difference in probability = (0.5 - 0.1111) * 100% ≈ 0.3889 * 100% ≈ 38.89%

So, Jerry is approximately 38.89% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

Final answer: 38.89%"
"As an agricultural specialist, I can help you with the problem.

To find the total number of apples picked, we need to add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mom. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, we can calculate her share as follows:

Let's denote the number of apples picked by Jenna's mom as M. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, Jenna's share can be represented as M/2.

We are given that Jenna's mom picked 20 apples, so M = 20. Therefore, Jenna's share is 20/2 = 10 apples.

The total number of apples picked is the sum of the apples picked by Jenna and her mom: M + (M/2) = 20 + 10 = 30 apples.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a wildlife enthusiast and animal behaviorist. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of rats in each cage, we need to first calculate the total number of straw pieces used for the rats. We know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw, and a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw. The total straw used for these animals is 50 (hamsters) + 20 (rabbits) = 70.

Since the total straw used for all animals is 160, the remaining straw is used for the rats. So, the total straw used for rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

Now, we know that each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, and there are 90 pieces of straw used for rats. To find the number of rats, we can divide the total straw used for rats by 6.

Number of rats = Total straw used for rats / 6
= 90 / 6
= 15

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we can divide the total number of rats by 3 to find the number of rats in each cage.

Number of rats in each cage = Total number of rats / 3
= 15 / 3
= 5

The final answer is 5."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the total amount Mandy needs to pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months. Since the interest rate is 2% per month, we can use the formula:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, the principal is $100, the rate is 2% or 0.02, and the time is 3 months.

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 3
Interest = $6

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Mandy needs to pay:

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $100 + $6
Total Amount = $106

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $106.

The final answer is: $106"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a supply chain management expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the number of bags of wheat sold, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold: 
Total Revenue = 30x

The total cost is the cost of buying the bags plus the cost of transportation:
Total Cost = 20x + 2x
Total Cost = 22x

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
400 = 30x - 22x
400 = 8x

To find the number of bags sold, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 400 / 8
x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final answer is 50."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of the food. Since they spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets, we can calculate the cost of food by subtracting $4.50 from the cost of tickets.

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Next, we need to find the total cost of the rides. Since they went on 2 different rides, each costing $33, we can multiply the cost of one ride by 2.

Cost of rides = 2 * $33
Cost of rides = $66

Now, we can find the total cost of all expenses by adding the cost of tickets, food, and rides.

Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we can divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fruit expert with extensive knowledge of peach cultivation and harvesting. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of hours he collects peaches by the number of peaches he can collect per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hours to minutes by multiplying 3 hours by 60.

3 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we can multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he can collect per minute: 180 minutes × 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches.

The final answer is: 360"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a wildlife biologist specializing in waterfowl behavior and nutrition. When it comes to the dietary needs of ducks, I can provide you with accurate information.

To determine the daily insect requirement for a flock of ten ducks, we need to divide the total weekly requirement by 7. 

The total weekly requirement is 3.5 pounds of insects. 

3.5 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 0.5 pounds/day

So, the ducks need 0.5 pounds of insects per day.

Final answer: 0.5"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a forestry expert with 10 years of experience in tree management. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Tom starts with 50 trees and plants 10 trees per year. However, he also chops down 2 trees each year. To find the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees.

First, let's calculate the total number of trees Tom plants in 10 years:

10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees

Since Tom chops down 2 trees per year, we subtract the total number of trees he chops down from the total number of trees he plants:

100 trees - 20 trees = 80 trees

Now, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 80 trees, we multiply 80 by 0.3:

80 * 0.3 = 24 trees

Finally, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees Tom has:

80 trees - 24 trees = 56 trees

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard. On Saturday, the neighbors took one third of the flamingos back, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the number of pink plastic flamingos left is 18 - 6 = 12.

On Sunday, 18 more pink plastic flamingos were added to the collection. So, the total number of pink plastic flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white plastic flamingos is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink plastic flamingos and white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's calculate the change Violetta will get.

To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to subtract the cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. The cost of a pencil is $1.20, and an eraser costs $0.30. To find the cost of a pen, we simply add these two amounts together.

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
= $1.20 + $0.30
= $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. To do this, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50
= $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a nutrition expert. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used, we need to calculate the total amount of carrots distributed and subtract it from the total amount available.

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds, and each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. To find the total amount of carrots distributed, we multiply the number of restaurants by the amount each restaurant receives:

40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available:

200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

Therefore, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"

There are 6277 children in Soda."
"As a Pokémon researcher, I've analyzed the situation to determine the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now.

To calculate the total number of cards, we need to break down the information provided:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards.
2. In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month:
20 (initial cards) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards."
"As a copy-editor, I can break down the problem into manageable parts to find the total amount Mark makes in a week.

Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher as x. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can set up the equation:

x + x = 1000

Combine like terms:

2x = 1000

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 500

Now that we know Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher, we can calculate the amount he earns from each publisher. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A is:

500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B is:

500 sentences * 10 cents = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we can add the amounts he earns from both publishers:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

The final answer is: 7500"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a water resource management specialist. I'd be happy to help you with Baldur's water intake.

To calculate the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to consider the amount of water he receives in the morning and the afternoon. Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, we can multiply the number of pails by the volume of each pail.

Morning water intake: 5 pails * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters
Afternoon water intake: 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters

Total water per day: 25 liters + 30 liters = 55 liters

Therefore, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.

Final answer: 55"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down John's earnings for the year.

To calculate John's total earnings, we need to consider the monetary reward and the 5% raise in salary. The award has a one-time monetary reward of $5,000. 

First, let's calculate his earnings before the award. John makes $2000 per week, and there are 52 weeks in a year. So, his total earnings before the award would be:

$2000 * 52 = $104,000

Now, let's add the award amount to his earnings:

$104,000 + $5,000 = $109,000

The award was given on the first day of the year, so it's already included in his earnings for the year.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a nutrition expert. Let's break down Carl's cheese consumption for the week.

Carl's daily cheese intake can be calculated by adding the slices used for lunch, breakfast, and dinner. 

For lunch, Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. So, he used 7 * 2 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. So, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

For dinner, Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (dinner) = 31 slices of cheese.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast and student. I'd be happy to help you with Brinley's problem.

To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we need to consider the following steps:

First, let's calculate the total score of the first five tests: 
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score. The lowest score is 71. 

Now, let's subtract 71 from the total score: 
438 - 71 = 367

Since Brinley wants an average of 93, we need to find the total score for six tests. To do this, we multiply the desired average by 6: 
93 × 6 = 558

Now, let's subtract the total score of the first five tests from the desired total score: 
558 - 367 = 191

So, Brinley needs a score of 191 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

The final answer is 191."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this candy weight problem.

To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a cost accountant with expertise in calculating costs and pricing strategies. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the cost of each cup, we need to first determine the total cost of 20 dozen cups. We know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is $6000. So, the total cost of 20 dozen cups is $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

Now, we can calculate the cost of each cup by dividing the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. There are 20 * 12 = 240 cups in 20 dozen.

Cost per cup = Total cost of 20 dozen cups / Number of cups
= $4800 / 240
= $20

The final answer is: $20"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 = $50.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $50 - $10 = $40 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $40, we can divide $40 by $5, which is 8 sessions.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing sessions. Since she earns $4 per session, we can divide $40 by $4, which is 10 sessions.

Since 8 babysitting sessions would not be enough to cover the cost, we need to find the least common multiple of 8 and 10. The least common multiple of 8 and 10 is 40.

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 40 / 4 = 10 times to earn $40.

The final answer is: 10"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a poultry expert with a passion for optimizing chicken coops and egg production. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

To solve this, we can use a simple algebraic approach. We know that the total number of eggs collected is 42, and the number of eggs produced by red chickens is 3 times the number of red chickens, while the number of eggs produced by white chickens is 5 times the number of white chickens. We also know that the number of white chickens is 2 more than the number of red chickens.

Let's represent the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We can write the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Since we know that w = r + 2, we can substitute this into the equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a geography enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the time Gary spends walking around the park.

To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and divide it by his walking speed. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all its sides:

Perimeter = 2(length + width)
Perimeter = 2(1.5 + 6)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a retail analytics expert. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. Since Sloane counted 50 more customers on the second day, the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50), which equals 100 + 150. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (x + 50) = 250

Combine like terms:

2x + 50 = 250

Subtract 50 from both sides:

2x = 200

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 100

Now that we know the number of customers on the first day, we can find the number of customers on the second day:

x + 50 = 100 + 50 = 150

Since the total number of customers on the third day was 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day:

500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250

Simplify the expression:

500 - 250 = 250

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a water treatment engineer. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

We have two pools, both leaking at 4 gallons/minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Then, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in both pools has decreased by 4 gallons/minute for the past 4 minutes. So, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Then, the big pool has 4y gallons of water now.

We can set up the equation: 2x - 16 = 4y.

We also know that the small pool lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has x - 16 gallons of water. We are given that the small pool has y gallons of water now, so we can set up the equation: x - 16 = y.

We can solve the system of equations by substituting 2x - 16 for 4y in the first equation: 2x - 16 = 2(x - 16). Simplifying, we get 2x - 16 = 2x - 32. This equation is true for all values of x, so we need to use the second equation to find the value of x.

Substituting x - 16 for y in the equation 2x - 16 = 4y, we get 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16). Simplifying, we get 2x - 16 = 4x - 64. Adding 64 to both sides, we get 2x + 48 = 4x. Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get 48 = 2x. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 24.

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation x - 16 = y: 24 - 16 = y, so y = 8.

The small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. This means she needs to pay a total of $2000 (initial amount) + 10% of $2000 (additional amount).

To calculate the additional amount, we multiply the initial amount by 0.1 (which represents 10%).
Additional amount = $2000 * 0.1 = $200

Now, we add the initial amount and the additional amount to find the total amount Janeth needs to pay.
Total amount = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. To find the total amount she will pay, we multiply the monthly payment by the number of months.
Total amount paid = $165 * 12 = $1980

Finally, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to pay to find the remaining balance.
Remaining balance = Total amount - Total amount paid
= $2200 - $1980
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a floristry expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know there are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses.

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
= 4 + 7
= 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we simply add the number of roses and dahlias.

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias

= 15

Therefore, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Harriet's current age is 21 years. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2:

Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42 years

Now, we know Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:

Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63 years

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:

Average age = (Harriet's age + Zack's age + Adrian's age) / 3
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Let's denote Naomi's points as N, Yuri's points as Y, Brianna's points as B, and Jojo's points as J. We know that N = 68.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Y = (1/2)N + 10
Y = (1/2)(68) + 10
Y = 34 + 10
Y = 44

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. 
B = N + 17
B = 68 + 17
B = 85

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna.
N + Y + B = 68 + 44 + 85
= 197

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the points scored by the other three students from the total points.
J = 251 - (N + Y + B)
J = 251 - 197
J = 54

So, Jojo scored 54 points."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a water management specialist. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, the water tank was filled with 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters for her garden, leaving 120 - 90 = 30 liters in the tank.

Next, she collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. This means she collected 2 * 30 = 60 liters of rainwater.

To find the total amount of water in the tank now, we add the remaining water to the collected rainwater: 30 + 60 = 90 liters.

The final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a gardening expert. Let's calculate the total number of flowers Andy plants.

To find the total number of flowers, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias. Since Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we can represent the number of petunias as 90 - 40.

Number of petunias = 90 - 40 = 50

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
= 90 + 50
= 140

Therefore, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to find the amount spent in the second year. Since the company spends a third of the first year's amount, we can calculate it as follows:

Total amount spent in the first year = $15,000
Amount spent in the second year = (1/3) × $15,000 = $5,000

Now, let's add the amounts spent in both years to find the total:

Total amount spent on advertising for the two years = $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000

The final answer is: $20,000"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the costs for Carlos and Benji's beach rentals.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a travel expert with extensive knowledge of road trips. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine the total number of days for the round trip, we need to calculate the number of days for each leg of the trip.

The bus trip from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days. Since the return trip is by car, which takes half as many days as the bus trip, the car trip from Rochester to New Jersey will take 6 / 2 = 3 days.

To find the total number of days for the round trip, we add the days for each leg: 6 (bus trip) + 3 (car trip) = 9 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"Hello there, fellow Pokémon trainer! I'm Yumi, a Pokémon researcher, and I'm here to help you with your question.

Let's dive into the world of Pokémon card counting! To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to calculate the total number of cards James has after losing some water type cards and buying new ones.

Initially, James had 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. After losing 8 water type cards, he's left with 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. Then, he buys 14 grass type cards, bringing the total grass type cards to 20 + 14 = 34.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire type) + 34 (grass type) + 32 (water type) = 96 cards.

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we'll divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100.

(32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water type card is 33%.

The final answer is 33."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a food enthusiast and expert in calculating the total cost of build-your-own burritos. Let's break down the costs:

The base burrito costs $6.50. Chad adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, and avocado for $1.00. He also chooses 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which totals to $0.50. To find the total cost of these items, I'll add them together:

$6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50
$8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50
$9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50
$10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00

Next, Chad upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, which adds chips and a drink. To find the new total, I'll add this to the previous total:

$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Finally, Chad uses a gift card for $5.00, so I'll subtract this from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a puzzle enthusiast and expert in puzzle completion strategies. I'd be happy to help you solve this puzzle.

To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of piece placement. Since Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, we can calculate her mom's rate as 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Now, let's add their rates together: 4 (Kalinda's rate) + 2 (her mom's rate) = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the total time it will take them to complete the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces (360) by their combined rate (6 pieces per minute).

360 ÷ 6 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes ÷ 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a watermelon expert with extensive knowledge of watermelon cultivation and harvesting. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn took 30% of them home, which is 0.3 * 120 = 36 watermelons.

The remaining watermelons on the farm are 120 - 36 = 84.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. To find the number of watermelons ready for harvest, we calculate 3/4 of 84:

3/4 * 84 = 63

Now, to find the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total remaining watermelons:

84 - 63 = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst with expertise in calculating business expenses. Let's break down the costs associated with Mark's fleet of cars.

To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

The cost of the cars can be calculated by multiplying the number of cars by the price per car: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000.

Next, we need to calculate the tax. Since Mark pays 10% tax on the cars, we can calculate it as 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

Finally, we need to add the registration fees, which are $1,000 per car for 12 cars, totaling $12,000.

Now, let's add up the costs: $240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a marine biologist specializing in shell collection and analysis. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to first find out how many shells she collected on Monday. Since Robert collects 20 shells and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, we can calculate the number of shells Kylie collected on Monday as follows:

Kylie's shells on Monday = Robert's shells on Monday + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 20 + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 25

Now, we know that Kylie collects 2 times more shells on Tuesday than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells she collects on Tuesday, we can multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2:

Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 * Kylie's shells on Monday
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 * 25
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 50

The final answer is 50."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, an entomologist specializing in insect ecology. I'm here to help you with your question.

To calculate the total number of insects in the garden, we need to first find the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can divide the number of ants by 2.

Number of ants = 50
Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we need to add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects.

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
= 50 + 25
= 75

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a wildlife expert specializing in penguin behavior. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

We have 36 penguins sunbathing in the snow. One-third of them jump in the ocean, and another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner. To find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we need to calculate the number of penguins that left and subtract it from the initial number.

One-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that jumped in the ocean. Another one-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that went inside the cave to eat their dinner.

The total number of penguins that left is 12 + 12 = 24 penguins.

To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still left sunbathing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a gardening expert with a focus on sustainable and efficient plant cultivation. I'd be happy to help you determine the number of cherry tomato vines Steve needs.

To calculate the total number of tomatoes required, we need to consider both Steve's and his girlfriend's consumption. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can express their combined consumption as 3x, where x is the amount his girlfriend eats per week. We know Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so we can set up the equation:

6 * 7 = 3x
42 = 3x
x = 42 / 3
x = 14

This means Steve's girlfriend eats 14 tomatoes per week. Now, we can calculate the total number of tomatoes required:

Total tomatoes per week = Steve's tomatoes + girlfriend's tomatoes
= 42 + 14
= 56

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes required by 3 to find the number of vines needed:

Number of vines = Total tomatoes per week / 3
= 56 / 3
= 18.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a vine, we'll round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Steve has enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend. Therefore, Steve needs at least 19 vines to meet their weekly demand.

Final answer: 19"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a food enthusiast and pizza connoisseur. When it comes to ordering pizzas, I always consider the number of slices needed to ensure everyone gets their fair share.

To determine the number of pizzas John needs, we can use a simple division. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices and John wants each of his 20 friends to have 4 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices required as follows:

Total slices needed = Number of friends * Slices per friend
Total slices needed = 20 * 4
Total slices needed = 80

Now, to find out how many pizzas John needs, we'll divide the total slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:

Number of pizzas = Total slices needed ÷ Slices per pizza
Number of pizzas = 80 ÷ 8
Number of pizzas = 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends gets 4 slices."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a stationery enthusiast and expert in optimizing pen usage. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we need to calculate the number of full pens he can make from the ink of the 25 pens. Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 pens ÷ 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since Ram already has 25 pens, we need to add the 5 full pens he can make to the original 25 pens.

25 (original pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens

So, Ram will have a total of 30 pens.

The final answer is: 30"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We're given that Jessa is 20 years old, Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, and Mary is 2 years younger than Joan. To find the sum of their ages, we need to calculate each person's age and then add them together.

First, we know Jessa's age: 20 years old.

Since Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, we add 5 to Jessa's age: 20 + 5 = 25 years old.

Next, we know Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so we subtract 2 from Joan's age: 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

Now, let's find the sum of their ages: 20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a student of mathematics. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow the steps below:

First, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as:

Number of students who went out through exit A = 30% of 1000
= 0.3 * 1000
= 300 students

Next, we calculate the number of students remaining after 300 students went out through exit A:

Number of students remaining = 1000 - 300
= 700 students

Then, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, we can calculate this as:

Number of students who went out through exit B = 3/5 * 700
= (3/5) * 700
= 420 students

Finally, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit C:

Number of students who went out through exit C = Number of students remaining - Number of students who went out through exit B
= 700 - 420
= 280 students

The number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert. We can represent this as an equation: 

Let R = number of candies Robert has
Let J = number of candies John has

J = 2R

We are also given that John has 54 candies, so we can substitute 54 for J in the equation:

54 = 2R

To solve for R, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

R = 54 ÷ 2
R = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find James' candies by adding 6 to Robert's total:

J = R + 6
J = 27 + 6
J = 33

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' total from John's total:

Difference = J - J
= 54 - 33
= 21

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a book enthusiast and bibliophile. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

To determine the total number of books Dolly and Pandora will collectively read, we need to consider the books each person has and the books they will read from the other person.

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book, so she will read a total of 2 (her own books) + 2 (books from Pandora) = 4 books.

Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book, so she will read a total of 1 (her own book) + 1 (book from Dolly) = 2 books.

The total number of books they will collectively read is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

Therefore, the correct answer is: 6"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a pen pal enthusiast and letter-writing expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total time Mike spends writing per week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts. 

First, let's calculate the total number of pages Mike writes per week. Since he receives 3 letters per week and sends 3 letters per week, the total number of pages he writes is 3 (received) + 3 (sent) = 6 pages.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages Mike writes per week is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Next, we need to convert the total number of pages to minutes. Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing per week is 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

The final answer is: 3"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a telecommunications expert. Let's break down Jason's phone plan usage to determine how many minutes he has left.

To calculate the total minutes used, we need to consider the daily call with his boss and the extra minutes used for calls to other people. Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for this call is:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, the total minutes used is:

450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (for other people) = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan:
1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries. Then, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Now, let's say Ginger gave Griffin x fries. After that, Griffin had 9 + x fries. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, Griffin was left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. We can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.

To solve for x, we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 27 - 7.

x = 20

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

Final answer: 20"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a marine biologist specializing in aquatic ecosystems. I'd be happy to help you with this snail conundrum.

Let's dive into the problem. We have two aquariums, one with 4 snails and the other with 32 snails. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 28. This difference is stated to be twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. The total number of fish in both aquariums is then 2x.

We can set up the equation based on the given information:

32 - 4 = 2x

Simplifying the equation:

28 = 2x

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the number of fish in each aquarium is 14.

Final answer: 14"
"As a makeup artist, I understand the importance of calculating the total cost of services provided. To determine the total amount Jean paid, I'll break down the calculation step by step.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a nutrition expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total calories from the total cookies eaten by each of them.

First, we know that Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. So, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we multiply the total cookies by 200.

Total calories consumed by Sue = 20 * 200 = 4000 calories
Total calories consumed by her sister = 13 * 200 = 2600 calories

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the calories consumed by her sister from the calories consumed by Sue.

Calories consumed by Sue more than her sister = 4000 - 2600 = 1400 calories

The final answer is: 1400"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this question.

To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, the total number of girls is 50% of 3 classes, which is 1.5 classes.

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls is 1.5 * 20 = 30 girls.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

This means that the third class has 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

Since there are 3 classes, the number of boys in each class is 30 / 3 = 10 boys.

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 10.

To find out how many cougars he killed today, we subtract 3 from the number of cougars he killed last night: 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.

Now, we add up the total number of animals Rick killed: 
- Wolves: 10 (last night) + 45 (today) = 55 wolves
- Cougars: 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27 cougars
- Total number of animals Rick killed: 55 wolves + 27 cougars = 82 animals.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a water park enthusiast and expert in water slide dynamics. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to calculate the number of times Anne went down the slide first. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a farm management specialist. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we need to first calculate the total number of cows in all 20 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows.

Initially, there were 20 cows in each stall, so the total number of cows in 20 stalls is:
20 stalls * 20 cows/stall = 400 cows

After Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, the total number of cows becomes:
400 cows + 40 cows = 440 cows

Since the cows are divided equally among the 20 stalls, we can divide the total number of cows by 20 to find the number of cows in each stall:
440 cows / 20 stalls = 22 cows/stall

Now, to find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8:
22 cows/stall * 8 stalls = 176 cows

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a forestry expert with a focus on tree biology and ecology. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total weight of the redwood, we need to first determine the number of 10-foot sections in the tree. Since the tree is 200 feet tall, we can divide the total height by 10:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.30 (which is equivalent to 30%):

8000 pounds * 0.30 = 2400 pounds

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood to find the weight of the remaining wood:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds.

Final answer: 5600"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a librarian with extensive experience in handling overdue book returns. Let's calculate the total amount Nancy owes.

To determine the total amount, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee. The cost of the overdue books is 8 books * $0.50 per book, which equals $4.00. 

Next, we add the flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book over a week overdue. 

$4.00 (overdue books) + $2.00 (flat fee) = $6.00

Nancy owes a total of $6.00."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fruit expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. To find out how many apples Jamal has, we can subtract 8 from 52:

52 - 8 = 44

Jamal has 44 apples.

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can find out how many bananas Jamal has by adding 4 to 44:

44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find out how many bananas Andrea has by dividing 48 by 2:

48 ÷ 2 = 24

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:

Andrea: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits
Jamal: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits

The total number of fruits is 76 + 92 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a professional baker with extensive experience in large-scale cookie production. When it comes to calculating flour requirements, I always follow a straightforward approach.

To determine the total amount of flour needed, we need to calculate the total number of cookies Carla is making and then divide that by 12, since 2 cups of flour are required for a dozen cookies.

Total number of cookies = 36 (today) + 30 (tomorrow) = 66 cookies

Now, let's divide the total number of cookies by 12:

66 cookies / 12 = 5.5

Since we can't buy a fraction of a cup of flour, we'll round up to the nearest whole number to ensure we have enough flour. In this case, Carla will need 6 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

Final Answer: The final answer is 6."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to calculate two thirds of 9,300 pennies.

Two thirds of 9,300 pennies is (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200 pennies.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply the number of pennies by the value of each penny:

6,200 * $0.01 = $62.

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62.

The final answer is: $62"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a botanist specializing in tree species and their growth patterns. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step:

We know that Chris has 6 trees in his yard. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

To find the number of trees in Harry's yard, we need to calculate twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has and then add 5. This can be represented as 2 * 3 + 5 = 11 trees.

Now, to find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard:

11 (Harry's trees) - 3 (Ferdinand's trees) = 8

Therefore, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Carmen has $100. Since Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, we can calculate Samantha's amount by adding $25 to Carmen's amount:

Samantha's amount = Carmen's amount + $25
Samantha's amount = $100 + $25
Samantha's amount = $125

Now, we're told that Daisy has $50 more than Samantha. To find Daisy's amount, we add $50 to Samantha's amount:

Daisy's amount = Samantha's amount + $50
Daisy's amount = $125 + $50
Daisy's amount = $175

To find the total amount of money the girls have, we add up their individual amounts:

Total amount = Carmen's amount + Samantha's amount + Daisy's amount
Total amount = $100 + $125 + $175
Total amount = $400

The final answer is: $400"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a real estate expert with extensive knowledge of the local market. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total price of the house, we need to add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Total price of the house: $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference is:
$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The total price of the house exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget by $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house.

To determine the net proceeds, we need to calculate the total amount Mr. Tan paid and subtract it from the selling price. 

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = $12,000. Then, we calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = $20,000. The total amount paid is the sum of these two fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $368,000.

The final answer is: $368,000"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a culinary expert with extensive experience in cooking techniques and kitchen management. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to break down the process into its components.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees. To find 40% of 20 minutes, we multiply 20 by 0.4.

Time to heat up the oil to 400 degrees = 20 minutes + (0.4 * 20 minutes)
= 20 minutes + 8 minutes
= 28 minutes

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. So, we subtract 5 minutes from the time it took to heat up the oil.

Time to cook the chicken = Time to heat up the oil - 5 minutes
= 28 minutes - 5 minutes
= 23 minutes

Now, we add the time it took to heat up the oil and the time it took to cook the chicken to find the total time.

Total time = Time to heat up the oil + Time to cook the chicken
= 28 minutes + 23 minutes
= 51 minutes

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a juggler with extensive experience in ball manipulation. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of blue golf balls, let's break it down step by step. We know that the juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Since half of the balls are golf balls, we can calculate the number of golf balls as follows:

Number of golf balls = Total number of balls / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

Now, since half of the golf balls are blue, we can calculate the number of blue golf balls as follows:

Number of blue golf balls = Number of golf balls / 2
= 8 / 2
= 4

Therefore, there are 4 blue golf balls.

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a home decor expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total number of windows in John's houses, we need to consider both the bedrooms and the additional windows. 

First, let's calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms. Since each bedroom has 2 windows and there are 3 bedrooms in each of the 2 houses, we can multiply the number of bedrooms by the number of windows per bedroom and then by the number of houses:

2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows

Next, we need to add the additional windows that are not connected to bedrooms. There are 4 additional windows in each house, so we multiply the number of houses by the number of additional windows per house:

2 houses * 4 additional windows per house = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows:

12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a knitting expert with a passion for creating beautiful and intricate patterns. I'd be happy to help you with your sweater project.

To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, let's break down the information given:

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete, the collar takes a tenth of that number, and the rosette takes twice as many as the collar. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.

First, let's calculate the number of stitches for the collar:
Collar stitches = 900 / 10 = 90 stitches

Next, we'll calculate the number of stitches for the rosette:
Rostette stitches = 2 * 90 = 180 stitches

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches.

To find the number of stitches for the two sleeves, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater:
Sleeve stitches = 1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:
Sleeve stitches per sleeve = 630 / 2 = 315 stitches

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a theater production specialist. I'd be happy to help you with Sean's line memorization.

To calculate the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, let's break it down:

The solo song has 54 lines. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, which is 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, we add up the lines from the song and both scenes: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a card enthusiast and expert in probability calculations. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

To find the number of cards with the letter D, let's break it down step by step:

First, we need to find the number of cards with the letter A. Since 2/5 of the cards have the letter A, we can calculate this as:

(2/5) × 80 = 32

Now, we subtract the number of cards with A from the total number of cards to find the remaining cards:

80 - 32 = 48

Next, we need to find the number of cards with the letter B. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards have the letter B, we can calculate this as:

(1/2) × 48 = 24

Now, we subtract the number of cards with B from the remaining cards to find the new total:

48 - 24 = 24

Finally, we need to find the number of cards with the letter C. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards have the letter C, we can calculate this as:

(5/8) × 24 = 15

Now, we subtract the number of cards with C from the remaining cards to find the number of cards with the letter D:

24 - 15 = 9

Therefore, the number of cards with the letter D is 9.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a gardening expert with extensive experience in landscape design and maintenance. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to multiply the number of holes by the time it takes to dig each type of hole.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a demographer. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. However, the problem doesn't provide that information. Let's assume their current ages are x and y. We know that the sum of their ages is 20, so we can write an equation:

x + y = 20

We also know that in 10 years, their ages will be x + 10 and y + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (y + 10) = x + y + 20.

Since x + y = 20, we can substitute this into the equation:

x + y + 20 = 20 + 20
x + y + 20 = 40

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

Final Answer: The final answer is 40."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into solving the problem step by step.

We're given that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. We can represent Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. This gives us our first equation:

R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can write another equation:

R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, let's simplify and solve for S. We can start by expanding the equation:

R + 9 = 3S + 27

Substituting R = 6S into the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Next, we'll subtract 3S from both sides:

3S + 9 = 27

Then, we'll subtract 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Finally, we'll divide both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"Hello there! I'm Yumi, a herpetologist specializing in snake species. I'm excited to help you with your question.

To find the total number of spots, we need to first determine the number of spots on the mambas. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in the snake park. To find the total number of spots, we can multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots on each cobra and add it to the product of the number of mambas and the number of spots on each mamba.

Total spots = (40 cobras * 70 spots) + (60 mambas * 35 spots)
Total spots = 2800 + 2100
Total spots = 4900

Now, to find half the number of spots, we can divide the total number of spots by 2.

Half the number of spots = 4900 / 2
Half the number of spots = 2450

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a jewelry designer with expertise in creating exquisite pieces. When it comes to designing necklaces, I always consider the balance of gemstones and beads to create a visually appealing piece.

To determine the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to calculate the total space between the topaz gemstones. Since there are 8 topaz gemstones, each 1 inch long, the total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the topaz gemstones take up 8 inches, so the space between the gemstones is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can divide the total space between the gemstones (17 inches) by the length of each bead (1/4 inch) to find the number of beads used:

17 inches / (1/4 inch) = 17 x 4 = 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a flag design enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of rows of 5-star rows on a 76-star flag, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows. There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so 3 * 8 = 24 stars. Similarly, there are 2 rows of 6 stars, so 2 * 6 = 12 stars.

The total number of stars in these rows is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Now, we subtract the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars on the flag: 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

Since each row has 5 stars, we can find the number of 5-star rows by dividing the remaining stars by 5: 40 ÷ 5 = 8.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 4 adults and 8 children sharing 8 packets of chocolate bars, with each packet containing 5 chocolate bars. We need to find out how many chocolate bars each child will get.

First, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. Since there are 8 packets, and each packet has 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Next, we determine how many chocolate bars the adults will receive. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children: 40 - 24 = 16.

Finally, we divide the remaining chocolate bars among the 8 children. To do this, we divide 16 by 8, which equals 2.

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars.

To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to determine the total number of minutes she works. Since she works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

Total minutes = (11 a.m. - 8 a.m.) * 60
Total minutes = 3 hours * 60
Total minutes = 180 minutes

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works:

Adjusted minutes = Total minutes - 30 minutes
Adjusted minutes = 180 - 30
Adjusted minutes = 150 minutes

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can calculate her earnings as follows:

Earnings = Adjusted minutes / 10 * $5
Earnings = 150 / 10 * $5
Earnings = 15 * $5
Earnings = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

The final answer is: $75"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sports enthusiast and game strategist. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, we have the following points for each player:

- Mike: 21 points
- Jim: 21 - 3 = 18 points
- Tony: 21 * 2 = 42 points

In the fourth round, each player receives an extra point if they have more than 20 points. Since Mike and Tony meet this condition, they both get an additional point.

- Mike's points: 21 + 1 = 22 points
- Tony's points: 42 + 1 = 43 points

Jim does not meet the condition, so his points remain the same.

Now, let's calculate the total points for all three players:
22 + 18 + 43 = 83

The final answer is: 83"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Will buys 15 oranges. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest. To find out how many oranges the sons washed, we need to calculate the number of oranges each son washed.

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washed 8 oranges.

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. Therefore, he washed 4 oranges.

In total, the sons washed 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the total number of oranges washed from the initial number of oranges: 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fitness enthusiast and personal trainer. I'd be happy to help you with Darren's exercise routine.

To calculate the total count of activities Darren has done in the two days, let's break it down:

Day 1:

- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the total count of each activity:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a nutrition expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg ÷ 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

The rice will last for 3 weeks.

Final answer: 3"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a bakery management consultant. I'd be happy to help you with Sam's bread sales.

To determine how many crates Sam was short of his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold. We know he sold 20 crates over the weekend, and the remaining crates were sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

Let's calculate the total number of crates sold:
Crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday: 15 + 12 + 18 = 45
Crates sold over the weekend: 20
Total crates sold: 45 + 20 = 65

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we can find the difference by subtracting the total crates sold from the target:
120 - 65 = 55

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final answer is: 55"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, an expert in auction analysis. Let's break down the bidding process step by step.

The initial bid was $200. Since there were 3 other bidders, the bids rose by $50 each time. This means the bids increased by $150 in total.

The first bid was $200.
The second bid was $200 + $150 = $350.
The third bid was $350 + $150 = $500.
The fourth bid was $500 + $150 = $650.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $500, $650, and $700.

The final bid was $700 + $50 = $750.

Carmen's total cost is $200 + $500 + $650 + $700 = $2250.

The final answer is: $2250."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation expert with a focus on logistics and cost analysis. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of John's driving service.

To determine the total cost of driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year. Since John drives to work and back, the total distance per day is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles. With 5 days of work per week, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. 

Now, let's calculate the total miles driven per year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

The cost of driving is $2 per mile, so the total cost of driving is 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000.

Additionally, John receives a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800.

The total cost of driving per year is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a book enthusiast and expert in book valuation. I'd be happy to help you with Elise's book sales.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Elise has 250 books in total and has sold 45 books this year. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Let x be the number of books sold in the first year.
Number of books sold in the first year = 2x
Total books sold in the first two years = x + 2x = 3x
Total books = 250
Unsold books = 50

We can set up an equation using the information:

3x + 50 = 250

Now, let's solve for x:

3x = 200
x = 200/3
x = 66.67 (round down to 67, since we can't sell a fraction of a book)

So, the number of books sold in the first year is 67. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, the number of books sold in the current year is 67/2 = 33.5 (round down to 33, since we can't sell a fraction of a book).

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money she earned in the second year:

Number of books sold in the second year = 33
Price per book = 20
Total amount earned in the second year = 33 * 20
Total amount earned in the second year = 660

The final answer is: 660"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with Watson's earnings for April.

To calculate Watson's total earnings for the month, we need to consider his daily earnings and the bonus he receives. Since he works 10 hours a day and earns $10 per hour, his daily earnings are:

10 hours/day * $10/hour = $100/day

Since April has 30 days, his total earnings for the month would be:

$100/day * 30 days = $3000

Additionally, he gets a $300 bonus for the whole month, so his total earnings for April would be:

$3000 + $300 = $3300

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a bakery management expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we need to calculate the remaining loaves after the morning sales and then find half of that amount.

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:
(2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

Next, we find the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
60 - 40 = 20 loaves

Now, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening:
(1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, we divide the remaining loaves by 2:
10 / 2 = 5 loaves

The final answer is 5."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a nutrition expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to understand the rate at which Joey loses weight. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate his weekly weight loss rate as follows:

Weekly weight loss rate = Total weight loss / Number of weeks
Weekly weight loss rate = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weekly weight loss rate = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can set up a proportion to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight:

Let x be the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

We know that Joey loses 2 pounds per week, so in x weeks, he will lose 2x pounds.

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we can set up the equation:

2x = 8

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 8 / 2
x = 4

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the savings.

To determine the total savings, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price, and then subtract the total cost at the discounted price.

The original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26.
The original cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $0.5 = $2.
The total original cost is $26 + $2 = $28.

The discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22.
The discounted cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $0.5 = $2.
The total discounted cost is $22 + $2 = $24.

"Hello there! I'm Yumi, a renowned geneticist specializing in limb development. I've studied the effects of the Lots-of-Limbs Serum, and I'm happy to help you understand its implications.

The serum causes the drinker to grow an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days. To determine the total number of new limbs after 15 days, we can calculate the number of complete cycles of 3 and 5 days.

In 15 days, there are 5 complete cycles of 3 days (15 ÷ 3 = 5). This means the person will grow 5 extra arms.

Additionally, in 15 days, there are 3 complete cycles of 5 days (15 ÷ 5 = 3). This means the person will grow 3 extra legs.

The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and legs: 5 + 3 = 8.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased and subtract that from his total budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 suits * $100/suit = $600.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. Since it costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, we can express this as: Flight ticket = 5 * $100 + $700 = $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the items purchased so far: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo's total budget is $6000, and he wants to save $2000, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left to spend on gifts.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a nutrition expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to consider the daily egg consumption of the family members. There are 5 family members in total. Three people eat 3 eggs each day, and the remaining two people eat 2 eggs each day.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat 3 eggs each day:
3 people x 3 eggs/person/day = 9 eggs/day

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat 2 eggs each day:
2 people x 2 eggs/person/day = 4 eggs/day

Now, we add the total number of eggs consumed by both groups to find the daily total:
9 eggs/day + 4 eggs/day = 13 eggs/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7 to find the weekly total:
13 eggs/day x 7 days = 91 eggs

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week.

The final answer is: 91"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now, we know Trent is 5 years older than Jane. To find Trent's age, we add 5 to Jane's age:

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a demographer with expertise in population studies. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the current population of Chile, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find Noah's current age: Since Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, we can find Noah's current age by adding 6 to Cera's age.

Noah's current age = Cera's current age + 6
Noah's current age = 46 + 6
Noah's current age = 52

2. Find the population of Chile six years ago: The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah.

Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * Noah's current age
Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * 52
Population of Chile six years ago = 156,000

3. Find the current population of Chile: Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can find the current population by multiplying the population six years ago by 2.

Current population of Chile = Population of Chile six years ago * 2
Current population of Chile = 156,000 * 2
Current population of Chile = 312,000

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a football strategist. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the total number of players is 105, and we need to find the number of players on the defense. We can start by denoting the number of players on the defense as 'x'. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. We can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 105.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2x + 4x + x = 210. Combining like terms, we get 7x = 210.

Dividing both sides by 7, we find that x = 30.

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a party planning expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of people invited. There are 2 families with 6 people each, so we multiply 2 by 6 to get 12 people. Then, there are 3 families with 4 people each, so we multiply 3 by 4 to get 12 people. Adding these together, we get 12 + 12 = 24 people invited.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. To find the number of people who still need to attend, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Now, 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come had previous commitments. To find this number, we divide 8 by 4, which equals 2. We subtract these 2 people from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total weight of marbles, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, find the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. 
   Solomon bought 20 marbles and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 
   2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 
   So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 
   Total marbles = 20 (bought) + 8 (given by father) = 28 marbles.

2. Now, add the marbles from the store to the marbles Solomon bought and his father gave him. 
   Total marbles = 50 (in the store) + 28 (bought and given) = 78 marbles.

3. Since each marble weighs 2kgs, multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight. 
   Total weight = 78 marbles * 2kgs = 156kgs.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast and educator. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys. If there are 30 boys, we can find the number of girls by multiplying the number of boys by 3.

Number of girls = 3 * 30
Number of girls = 90

We also know that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find the number of nongendered children, we can multiply the number of boys by 1/10.

Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, we can add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children in the classroom.

Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
Total number of children = 30 + 90 + 3
Total number of children = 123

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a party planner with expertise in event management. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the number of women left at the party, we need to first determine the total number of people who left. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Let's denote the total number of people as x. We know that 1/4 of x left, and 22 men stayed. Since 3 men left, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

We can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 3

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 3 * 4
x = 12

So, the total number of people at the party was 12.

Now, we know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, which is 1/4 * 12 = 3 people. Since 3 men left, the number of women who left is:

Number of women who left = Total number of people who left - Number of men who left
= 3 - 3
= 0

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 0
= 15

We know that the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4. To find the cost of the magazine, we can divide the cost of the book by 2.

Magazine cost = Book cost / 2
Magazine cost = $4 / 2
Magazine cost = $2

Now, we know the magazine costs $2. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so we can subtract $1 from the magazine cost to find the cost of the pen.

Pen cost = Magazine cost - $1
Pen cost = $2 - $1
Pen cost = $1

Therefore, the pen costs $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. To find the number of pencils in each box, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of boxes and the loose pencils.

Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as x. We can set up the equation:

3x + 2 = 26

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

3x = 24

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, we need to find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. We know Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which is a total of 3 * 8 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils.

The total number of pencils is 26 + 46 = 72.

To find the number of boxes needed, we can divide the total number of pencils by 24 (since each box can hold 24 pencils).

72 / 24 = 3

So, Jam and Meg need 3 boxes to store all their pencils.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a coffee connoisseur and expert in coffee brewing. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total weakening of Shannon's iced coffee, we need to consider two factors: the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the weakening effect of the added cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening caused by the cooling. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes used as follows:

Number of ice cubes = Total cooling / Cooling per ice cube
= 65 / 13
= 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening caused by the cooling is:

Weakening due to cooling = Number of ice cubes * Weakening per ice cube
= 5 * 12
= 60 milliliters

Next, let's consider the weakening effect of the added cream. Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

Total weakening = Weakening due to cooling + Weakening due to cream
= 60 + 15
= 75 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a music enthusiast and record collector. I've been in the business of buying and selling vinyl records for years, and I've seen my fair share of trades.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 5 people came into the store and left with 7 new records. Since the store's trade policy is 2 old records for 1 new record, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

2x = 7

where x is the number of old records traded.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 7 ÷ 2
x = 3.5

Since we can't trade a fraction of a record, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll assume that each person got 1 new record, and the store's policy is consistent.

Now, we know that each person traded 1 old record for 1 new record. To find the total number of old records traded, we can multiply the number of people by the number of old records each person traded:

5 people * 1 old record/person = 5 old records

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 5 old records."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a software engineer with expertise in salary calculations and programming industry trends. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers. Since they make up 2/5 of the total employees, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * Total employees
= (2/5) * 100
= 40

Next, we know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. So, the salary of a senior programmer is:

Salary of a senior programmer = Salary of a junior programmer + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month:

Total amount for junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of a junior programmer
= 40 * $2000
= $80,000

Similarly, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month:

Total amount for senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of a senior programmer
= 60 * $2400
= $144,000

Finally, we can find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month by adding the amounts for junior and senior programmers:

Total amount = Total amount for junior programmers + Total amount for senior programmers
= $80,000 + $144,000
= $224,000

The final answer is: $224,000"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that 5 people got on the bus at the first stop and 7 people got off at the second stop. To find the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we need to consider the number of people heading to the third stop.

Let's denote the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as x. We can set up an equation based on the given information:

x + 5 (people who got on at the first stop) - 7 (people who got off at the second stop) = 20 (total people heading to the third stop)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 5 - 7 = 20

x - 2 = 20

x = 22

So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a lollipop connoisseur and expert in candy analysis. Let's break down Oscar's lollipop journey step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Next, he passes 14 out to his friends, which reduces his lollipop count to 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

Then, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

After that, he eats 3 more lollipops that night, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a mobile technology expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to determine the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes. Since the phone is currently at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

The phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes. To find the time it takes to charge 40%, we can set up a proportion:

40% / 1% = x / 3 minutes

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3:

x = (40% * 3 minutes)
x = 0.4 * 3
x = 1.2 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1.2 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

1.2 minutes / 60 = 0.02 hours

Therefore, it will take approximately 0.02 hours, or 2 minutes, to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a retail analyst. Let's break down the customer's shopping trip.

The customer's loyalty card offers $1 off for every $20 spent. Since they spent $80, they initially received 80 / 20 = 4 rewards.

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the actual rewards they got is 4 * 2 = 8 dollars.

Now, subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: 80 - 8 = 72.

The customer paid $72 on this shopping trip."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you compare the two job offers.

To determine which job Nick should choose, we need to calculate the net pay for each job. Let's break it down:

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Annual salary: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net pay, Job B has a higher net pay rate of $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you compare the two offers.

To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment for each offer.

Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

The cost difference between the two offers is $3,350 - $3,450 = -$100. However, since we're looking for the cost difference, we can express this as a positive value by taking the absolute difference: |$3,350 - $3,450| = $100.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a food enthusiast and hot dog connoisseur. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

To determine how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we need to calculate the amount each person ate. We know Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

Since John ate half the amount Thomas ate, we can calculate John's hot dog consumption as 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the amount Luke ate from the amount John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the three groups are equal in number, except for the smallest one, which is 10 less than each of the other two groups. Let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. Since the other two groups have the same number of students, each of them has 2x students.

We can set up the equation: x + 2x + 2x = 200

Combine like terms: 5x = 200

Divide both sides by 5: x = 40

So, the smallest group has 40 students.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a farm animal expert. Let's dive into the problem.

Farmer Brown has 60 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. He has twice as many chickens as cows. We need to find the total number of legs the animals have.

To solve this, we can use algebra. Let's say the number of cows is x. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 20

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens: 2x = 2(20) = 40 chickens.

Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 x 4 = 80 legs.
Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 x 2 = 80 legs.

The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"

Week 1: 3 balls
Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

Since Josh dropped 3 balls, but 2 were caught, he lost 1 ball. So, he has 6 - 1 = 5 balls left.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a wildlife biologist specializing in amphibian and reptile species. I'm here to help you with your question.

Let's break down the information given:

- The pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle.
- The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad.
- The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake.
- The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird.

We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal and the container itself. The container weighs 20 pounds.

Total weight = weight of pink frog + weight of blue beetle + weight of green toad + weight of yellow snake + weight of red bird + weight of container
Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20
Total weight = 240 pounds

First, let's calculate the total number of legs from the tables with 4 legs: 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of legs from the tables with 3 legs: 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs.

Now, we can find the total number of legs by adding the legs from both types of tables: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs.

The total number of legs in the restaurant is 310."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a cookie connoisseur and cookie math expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, and each bag contains 36 cookies. She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week. To find out how many cookies her son eats, we can multiply the number of cookies per day by the number of days:

4 cookies/day * 5 days = 20 cookies

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so we can calculate the total number of cookies he eats as:

1 cookie/day * 7 days = 7 cookies

Now, let's add the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband:

20 cookies + 7 cookies = 27 cookies

Since the bag has 36 cookies, we can subtract the total number of cookies consumed from the total number of cookies in the bag to find out how many cookies are left for Jenny to eat:

36 cookies - 27 cookies = 9 cookies

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total cost of the shirts Davos bought.

To find the total cost of the shirts, we need to calculate the discount on one shirt first. The discount is 40% of the original price of $30. 

Discount on one shirt = 40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, subtract the discount from the original price of one shirt:

Price of one shirt after discount = $30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, multiply the discounted price by 2:

Total cost of 2 shirts = $18 * 2 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst with expertise in calculating revenue and profit margins. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The factory used to make tractors and sold 10 tractors a day at $100 each. Now, they produce silos and sell 5 silos a day at $220 each. To find the percentage increase in daily revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from tractors and silos separately.

Revenue from tractors: 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day
Revenue from silos: 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

Total revenue: $1000 + $1100 = $2100/day

To find the difference in daily revenue: $1100 - $1000 = $100

Now, let's find the percentage increase: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

"Hi there! I'm Yumi, and I'm here to help you with the budgeting for Morgan's birthday party.

To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wants to play once, so the total cost for mini-golf is $5. The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride the go-karts twice, so the total cost for go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20. 

The total cost of the activities is $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) = $25.

Now, let's subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 (budget) - $25 (total cost) = $65.

Since each friend will also get $5 in arcade tokens, we need to subtract that from the remaining budget as well: $65 - $5 = $60.

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend (including the arcade tokens): $60 / $5 = 12.

So, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to first determine how much money he had initially and how much he spent on gumballs.

Billy had $10 initially. He spent $2 on gumballs, so he had $10 - $2 = $8 left. Since he took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, he must have had $2 left as change. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 initially.

Now, we know that Billy spent $8 on candy. Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide the amount spent on candy ($8) by the cost per pound ($1.5) to find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought.

Let's calculate: $8 ÷ $1.5 = 5.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 5.33 pounds of candy.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into solving the problem.

We're given that Carver is 45 years old, and his age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can represent Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. So, we have the equation:

C = 2S - 5

Since we know Carver's age, we can substitute C = 45 into the equation:

45 = 2S - 5

To solve for S, we'll add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2S

50 = 2S

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2:

50 ÷ 2 = S

25 = S

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

To determine the number of days between train services, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in one trip and then divide it by the service interval.

The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than the combined distance from the third city to the first city. The combined distance from the third city to the first city is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. Therefore, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in a day by the service interval:

900 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.05 days

To convert days to hours, we multiply by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):

0.05 days * 24 hours/day = 1.2 hours

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

1.2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 72 minutes

The train goes between services for approximately 72 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"Hello there! I'm Yumi, a skilled dog bed designer. I'd be happy to help you calculate the amount of stuffing needed for Mark's custom dog beds.

To determine the total amount of stuffing required, we need to calculate the amount needed for each type of bed and then add them together.

A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. To find the average amount of stuffing for a collie bed, we can use the formula: (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed:

- 4 chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds
- 3 collie beds: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds

To find the total amount of stuffing needed, we add the amounts together: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation engineer with expertise in route optimization and travel time calculations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the total time taken for the trip, we need to consider the time taken for each segment of the journey.

Time taken to drive to his friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Time taken for the detour:
Distance = 10 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 10 / 70 = 0.14 hours

Time taken to drive back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken = Time taken to drive to his friend's house + Time taken for the detour + Time taken to drive back home
Total time taken = 2.86 + 0.14 + 3 = 5.99 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5.99}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are 96 fourth-graders in total, and 43 of them are girls. To find the number of boys, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.

Number of boys = Total students - Number of girls
= 96 - 43
= 53

However, we also know that 5 girls and 4 boys were absent. To find the number of boys present, we need to subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

Number of boys present = Total number of boys - Number of absent boys
= 53 - 4
= 49

So, there were 49 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

The final answer is 49."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know there are 6 girls in the park, and there are twice as many boys as girls. To find the number of boys, we can divide the number of girls by 2.

Number of boys = Number of girls / 2
Number of boys = 6 / 2
Number of boys = 3

Now, we add the number of boys and girls to find the total number of kids in the park.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 3 + 6
Total number of kids = 9

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane needs on the third test, we can subtract the points she has already scored from the total required points.

Total required points: 42
Points scored so far: 15 + 18 = 33

Points needed on the third test: 42 - 33 = 9

Since Jane cannot score a fraction of a point, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure she meets the minimum requirement. However, in this case, 9 is already a whole number, so no rounding is necessary.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a retail management expert. I'll be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break down the information given:

We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. We also know that the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, minus 5. This can be represented as 4(3) - 5 = 7.

Now, we're told that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, three times that many is 3(7) = 21.

To find the total number of customers kicked out, we add the number of customers kicked out for each reason: 3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31.

However, we're told that a total of 50 people were kicked out. To find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the total number of customers kicked out for the three reasons from the overall total: 50 - 31 = 19.

Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is 19.

Final answer: 19"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Erin scored 14 points and now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to find Sara's initial score.

Let's denote Sara's initial score as x. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up the equation:

3x = 14 + 8 (since Erin scored 14 points and now has three times more points than Sara)

Combine like terms:

3x = 22

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 22 / 3
x = 7.33

So, Sara had approximately 7.33 points before.

Now, to find out how many points Erin had before, we can multiply Sara's points by 3:

Erin's points before = 3 * 7.33
Erin's points before = 22

To calculate the total number of shoes sold, let's break it down by day:

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, 6 people returned their shoes, so we need to subtract those from the total.

Total number of shoes sold = 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returned) = 50

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a procurement specialist with expertise in inventory management and cost analysis. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment.

To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces, we need to first determine the number of faulty pieces and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Let's assume the total number of pieces is x. Since 40% of the equipment were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The number of functioning pieces is x - 0.4x = 0.6x.

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is the total amount spent on all pieces minus the amount spent on faulty pieces. Since the total amount spent on all pieces is $400,000, the amount spent on faulty pieces is 0.4x.

We can set up an equation to represent this:

0.6x = 400,000 - 0.4x

Combine like terms:

0.6x + 0.4x = 400,000

1x = 400,000

x = 400,000

Now that we know the total number of pieces is 400,000, we can find the number of functioning pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = 0.6x
= 0.6 * 400,000
= 240,000

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 400,000 - 0.4 * 400,000
= 400,000 - 160,000
= 240,000

The final answer is: $240,000"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a dairy expert with extensive knowledge of sheep farming and milk production. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep.

Half of the sheep is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

She gets 1 kg of milk from 15 sheep, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

She gets 2 kg of milk from the other 15 sheep, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

The total amount of milk Mary collects every day is 15 + 30 = 45 kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the number of rolls Mrs. Sherman had left after feeding her children, we subtract 6 from 12 (since she fed 6 children one each).

12 - 6 = 6

Then, she broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply 6 by 8.

6 × 8 = 48

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

Final answer: 48"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fruit expert with extensive knowledge of orchard management and apple cultivation. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to analyze the given information. We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday and received $56, which is equivalent to 14 apples (since each apple is sold at $4). On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples, and on Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 apples.

To find the total number of apples picked, we can simply add the number of apples picked on each day:

14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

Therefore, Lucy picked a total of 50 apples over the three days.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating Karan's monthly payment.

To determine the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest and divide it by the number of months. Since Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months at an interest rate of 10%, we can use the formula:

M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n - 1]

Where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal amount = $3,650
i = monthly interest rate = 10%/12 = 0.008333
n = number of payments = 5

Plugging in the values, we get:

M = $3,650 [ 0.008333(1 + 0.008333)^5 ] / [ (1 + 0.008333)^5 - 1]
M = $3,650 [ 0.008333(1.008333)^5 ] / (1.008333)^5 - 1]
M = $3,650 [ 0.008333(1.043383) ] / 1.043383 - 1]
M = $3,650 [ 0.00875 ] / 1.043383 - 1]
M = $3,650 * 0.00843
M = $30.73

So, Karan needs to pay approximately $30.73 per month.

The final answer is: $30.73"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a geography enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 14 km/h x 8 h
Distance = 112 km

Now, let's calculate the distance hiked by Chloe. Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 9 km/h x 5 h
Distance = 45 km

To find the difference in distance hiked between Cho and Chloe, we subtract the distance hiked by Chloe from the distance hiked by Cho.

Difference = Distance hiked by Cho - Distance hiked by Chloe
Difference = 112 km - 45 km
Difference = 67 km

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst with expertise in calculating profit margins. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total revenue and total cost. 

First, we calculate her total revenue: 36 cups * $1/cup = $36. 

Next, we calculate her total cost: $18.

Her profit is her revenue minus her cost: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade is 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, we can calculate her profit per hour: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a music educator with expertise in choir management. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of girls in the choir. Since 50% of the 52 members are girls, we can calculate this as 0.5 * 52 = 26.

Next, we know that half of the people performing can't make it to the show. To find the total number of people performing, we need to add the number of girls (26) and the 3 teachers. This gives us 26 + 3 = 29.

Now, we need to find half of 29. This can be calculated as 29 / 2 = 14.5. Since we can't have half a person, we'll round down to 14.

However, we need to consider that the 3 teachers are also part of the performance. So, the total number of people performing is 26 (girls) + 3 (teachers) - 14 (half of the performers) = 15.

The final answer is 15."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a carnival enthusiast and expert in ride ticket calculations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how much David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying 9 ride tickets and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. Therefore, he saves $30 - $18 = $12.

However, we can also consider the scenario from Dasha's perspective. If Dasha buys 9 ride tickets, the cost is $18. If she buys a ride bracelet, the cost is $30.

In this case, David saves $30 - $18 = $12.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a gift wrapping expert. When it comes to creating beautiful bows, the key is to balance aesthetics with practicality. To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon by the number of gifts.

Let's calculate the ribbon per gift:

Total gifts = 6 (for family) + 4 (for friends) + 2 (for teachers) = 12 gifts
Total ribbon = 144 inches

Ribbon per gift = Total ribbon / Total gifts
Ribbon per gift = 144 / 12
Ribbon per gift = 12 inches

To ensure a perfect bow, it's essential to consider the size of the gift and the desired bow size. A general rule of thumb is to use 2-3 inches of ribbon for a small to medium-sized gift, and 4-5 inches for larger gifts. However, for this calculation, we'll stick to the straightforward division.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a popsicle connoisseur and ratio expert. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

To find the number of popsicles each person has, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the parts in the ratio (5 + 6 = 11).

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Let x be the multiplier for the ratio. Then, the total number of popsicles is 5x + 6x = 11x.

Since we know the total number of popsicles is 165, we can set up the equation:

11x = 165

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 11:

x = 165 ÷ 11
x = 15

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:

Betty: 5x = 5(15) = 75
Sam: 6x = 6(15) = 90

To find the difference, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

90 - 75 = 15

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is 15."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the costs to determine how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable package.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services. The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling. To find the discounted cost, we calculate 20% of $10, which is $2. So, the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix and the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus: $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

The cost of the cable package is $60 per month. To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:

$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42

Therefore, Tim saves $42 per month by cancelling his cable package.

The final answer is: $42"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a music producer with expertise in songwriting, recording, and editing. Let's break down the time spent on each activity to determine the percentage of time Carol spent editing.

First, we need to convert the time spent recording from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the time spent recording as follows:

Time spent recording = 0.5 hours

Now, we can add up the time spent on each activity:

Total time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
Total time = 4 hours + 0.5 hours + 1.5 hours
Total time = 6 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we can divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100
= (1.5 hours / 6 hours) * 100
= 25%

Therefore, Carol spent 25% of her total work time editing."

Mark has $50 in his bank account and wants to buy a bike that costs $300. To determine how many days he needs to save, we need to calculate the remaining amount he needs to earn.

Remaining amount = Cost of the bike - Initial amount
Remaining amount = $300 - $50
Remaining amount = $250

Since Mark earns $10 per day, we can calculate the number of days he needs to save as follows:

Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily earnings
Number of days = $250 / $10
Number of days = 25

Therefore, Mark needs 25 days to save enough money to buy the bike.

Final answer: 25"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, an entomologist specializing in arthropod identification and population dynamics. I'd be happy to help you with the bug count.

To calculate the total number of bugs, we need to break down the information given:

Number of spiders = 90
Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

Since millipedes are segmented worms, not insects, I'll treat them as a separate category. However, for the sake of calculation, we'll consider them as part of the total bug count.

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 48

Now, let's add up the total number of bugs:

Total number of bugs = 90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica. To find Beth's age, we simply add 5 to Erica's age:

Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35

Now, we know Alice is 7 years older than Beth. To find Alice's age, we add 7 to Beth's age:

Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7
Alice's age = 42

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is simply Alice's age minus Erica's age:

Difference in ages = Alice's age - Erica's age
Difference in ages = 42 - 30
Difference in ages = 12

The final answer is 12."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst with expertise in calculating daily earnings. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total earnings for the builder, we need to calculate the total number of working days in a year. Since the builder works 4 weeks every month and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total number of weeks worked in a year is 4 * 4 = 16 weeks.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of working days in a year is 16 * 52 = 832 days.

Now, we can multiply the number of working days by the daily wage to find the total earnings:

832 days * $50 per day = $41,600

The final answer is: $41,600"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a baking expert with a passion for precision. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we need to calculate the quantities for both ingredients.

For flour, Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies, so we multiply the normal recipe by 4. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour, so 3 * 4 = 12 cups. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide 12 by 2 to get the number of bags: 12 / 2 = 6 bags.

For milk, Mark is also making a quadruple batch, so we multiply the normal recipe by 4. The normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk, so 1 * 4 = 4 cups. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide 4 by 2 to get the number of bottles: 4 / 2 = 2 bottles.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a home energy efficiency expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate the energy saved by reducing the usage of your air conditioner.

To determine the energy saved, we need to calculate the difference in energy consumption between 8 hours and 3 hours of AC usage per day.

First, let's calculate the energy used in 8 hours a day:
Energy used in 8 hours a day = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh)

Next, we'll calculate the energy used in 3 hours a day:
Energy used in 3 hours a day = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh

Now, let's find the energy saved per day:
Energy saved per day = 7200 Wh - 2700 Wh = 4500 Wh

To convert the energy saved per day to kilowatts, we'll divide by 1000:
Energy saved per day = 4500 Wh / 1000 = 4.5 kWh

Finally, let's calculate the energy saved in 30 days:
Energy saved in 30 days = 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a wildlife biologist specializing in equine behavior and stripe patterns. I'm here to help you with your question about the average number of stripes on the zebras.

To calculate the average number of stripes, we need to add up the total number of stripes and divide by the number of zebras. Let's break it down step by step:

The first two zebras have 17 stripes each, so together they have 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.
The third zebra has 36 stripes.
The fourth zebra has half the number of stripes of the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The average number of stripes per zebra is 22.

Final Answer: The final answer is 22."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a culinary expert with a passion for creating delicious dishes. Today, I'm happy to help you with calculating the cost of ingredients for muffaletta sandwiches.

To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed. Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need:

- 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

- 5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
- 5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

The final answer is: $50.00"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a pastry chef and expert in Italian desserts. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the number of corns as follows:

Number of corns = 2 * Number of cannolis
= 2 * 40
= 80

However, it's mentioned that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis. This means he initially had 40 - 40 = 0 corns. Then, he bought 60 more cannolis, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

Now, we can calculate the total number of corns he has now:

Number of corns = 2 * Number of cannolis
= 2 * 100
= 200

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is 200 + 100 = 300.

Final answer: The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 300."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fitness enthusiast and step tracking expert. I'd be happy to help you with Elliott's step count.

To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, let's break down his daily step goal and the steps he completed before the jog.

Elliott's daily step goal is 10,000 steps. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the remaining steps from the total steps completed before the jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

"As a reading specialist, I'd be happy to help you determine how much time Toby has to spare before his flight.

To calculate the time it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of words in the book by his reading rate.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words
Time to finish the book = Total words / Reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive 60 - 30 = 30 minutes early.

The final answer is 30."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst with expertise in contract labor management. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to consider the number of employees and their hourly wage.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. This means the total amount paid in May is:

40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left. 1/4 of 40 is 10 employees. So, the company had 40 - 10 = 30 employees in June.

The total amount paid in June is:
30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

The total amount paid in the two months is:
$24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

The final answer is: $42,000"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down Sally's expenses to determine how much money she has left.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means Sally pays full price for the first pound and half price for the second pound. The cost of the first pound is $3. The cost of the second pound is $3 / 2 = $1.50. So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we add the cost of the mixed bag of seashells, which is $1.50, and the cost of the 4 magnets, which is 4 x $0.25 = $1. The total cost of all the items is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fireworks expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total amount Tim spent on fireworks.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks and add the cost of the finale firework. 

The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice as much, which is 2 x $400 = $800. The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 x $1200 = $240. The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a pastry expert with extensive experience in baking and cookie production. When it comes to making madeleine cookies, I always consider the storage and shelf life of the cookies to ensure they remain fresh for a longer period.

To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we can calculate the total number of cookies required for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, we can multiply the number of nights by the number of cookies consumed per night:

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies needed by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs:

60 cookies ÷ 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

Final answer: 5"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a candle expert with extensive knowledge of candle manufacturing and quality control. When it comes to ensuring the safety and quality of homemade candles, I always emphasize the importance of identifying and addressing potential defects.

In this case, we're dealing with candles that are 99% guaranteed not to explode, but 5% of them have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the intersection of these two defects.

First, let's calculate the number of candles with the defect that makes them smell like wet dog:
5% of 50,000 candles = 0.05 x 50,000 = 2,500 candles

Since these candles are also more dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog, we can assume that all 2,500 candles with the defect will explode.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 2,500.

Final answer: $\boxed{2500}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fashion expert with a keen eye for discounts and sales. When it comes to calculating the total cost of discounted items, I always make sure to break it down step by step.

To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to calculate the discount amount first. The discount is 30% of the regular price of $20.

Discount = 30% of $20 = 0.3 * $20 = $6

The discounted price of each blouse is the regular price minus the discount amount.

Discounted price = $20 - $6 = $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

Total cost = 4 * $14 = $56

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half that amount from the shortest trees (15 apples), and an unknown amount from the average trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees (2x) and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees (45 apples). Since her sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

30 + 15 + x + 2x + 45 = 500

Combine like terms:

60 + 3x = 500

Subtract 60 from both sides:

3x = 440

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 146.67

Since x represents the number of apples gathered from the tallest trees by Joanne, we can calculate the number of apples gathered from the average trees by subtracting the total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees from the total number of apples gathered by both sisters:

Total apples gathered from tallest and shortest trees = 30 + 15 + 2x + 45 = 90 + 3x
Total apples gathered from average trees = 500 - (90 + 3x)

Substituting x = 146.67:

Total apples gathered from average trees = 500 - (90 + 3(146.67))
Total apples gathered from average trees = 500 - (90 + 440)
Total apples gathered from average trees = 500 - 530
Total apples gathered from average trees = -30

However, the number of apples cannot be negative. This indicates that the initial assumption that the number of apples gathered from the average trees is x is incorrect. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-examine the problem. Since Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, the number of apples gathered from the tallest trees by Joanne is 30, and the number of apples gathered from the shortest trees by Joanne is 15. The number of apples gathered from the tallest trees by her sister is 2x, and the number of apples gathered from the shortest trees by her sister is 45.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

30 + 15 + x + 2x + 45 = 500

Combine like terms:

90 + 3x = 500

Subtract 90 from both sides:

3x = 410

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 136.67

Since x represents the number of apples gathered from the tallest trees by Joanne, we can calculate the number of apples gathered from the average trees by subtracting the total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees from the total number of apples gathered by both sisters:

Total apples gathered from tallest and shortest trees = 30 + 15 + 2x + 45 = 90 + 3x
Total apples gathered from average trees = 500 - (90 + 3x)

Substituting x = 136.67:

Total apples gathered from average trees = 500 - (90 + 3(136.67))
Total apples gathered from average trees = 500 - (90 + 410)
Total apples gathered from average trees = 500 - 500
Total apples gathered from average trees = 0

The final answer is 0."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a wildlife expert with a specialization in camel and dromedary behavior. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

To determine the number of dromedaries, we can use the information given about the number of heads and bumps. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that camels have two humps each, while dromedaries have one hump each. The total number of bumps is 304, and the total number of heads is 180. We can set up an equation based on this information:

2c + d = 304 ... (Equation 1)
c + d = 180 ... (Equation 2)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of c (camels) and d (dromedaries).

First, let's isolate c in Equation 2:
c = 180 - d

Now, substitute this expression for c into Equation 1:
2(180 - d) + d = 304

Expand and simplify the equation:
360 - 2d + d = 304
360 - d = 304

Subtract 360 from both sides:
-d = -56

Multiply both sides by -1:
d = 56

Now that we have found the number of dromedaries, we can conclude that there are 56 dromedaries.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a travel enthusiast and expert in route planning. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip.

To find the total distance, let's break it down into parts. Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for the first 4 days. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:

200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 km is:

0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

So, the total distance traveled in the first 6 days is:
800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we add the distances traveled in the first 6 days and the second week:
1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3140}$"

"Hello there! I'm Yumi, a feline behaviorist. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We start with 50 cats on the rock. Four boats come and take away 5 cats each. To find the total number of cats taken away, we multiply the number of boats by the number of cats each boat takes: 4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats remaining.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats run after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3 and then divide by 5: (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18 cats.

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

So, there are 12 cats left on the rock.

The final answer is 12."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fashion expert with a keen eye for style and a passion for solving problems. Today, I'm excited to help you figure out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, the original price of the jogger jeans is $28 - $6 = $22.

We also know that Cole saved a total of $6, and 1/3 of it came from the jogger jeans. This means he saved 1/3 * $22 = $7.33 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $7.33, came from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's find the original price of the tattered jeans. Since Cole saved $6 from the tattered jeans, we can set up an equation:

1/3 * $22 + 2/3 * (x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

1/3 * $22 + 2/3 * x + 4 = 6

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fractions:

$22 + 2x + 12 = 18

Combine like terms:

2x + 34 = 18

Subtract 34 from both sides:

2x = -16

Divide both sides by 2:

x = -8

Wait, that can't be right! The price of the tattered jeans can't be negative. Let's go back to the original equation:

1/3 * $22 + 2/3 * (x + 6) = 6

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fractions:

$22 + 2x + 12 = 18

Combine like terms:

2x + 34 = 18

Subtract 34 from both sides:

2x = -16

Divide both sides by 2:

x = -8

This still doesn't make sense. Let's try a different approach. We know that Cole saved $6 in total, and 1/3 of it came from the jogger jeans. This means he saved $6 - $7.33 = $1.33 from the tattered jeans.

Since the tattered jeans cost $28, we can set up an equation:

$28 - $1.33 = x + 6

Subtract $28 from both sides:

-$0.33 = x + 6

Subtract 6 from both sides:

-$6.33 = x

This still doesn't make sense. Let's try again.

We know that Cole saved $6 in total, and 1/3 of it came from the jogger jeans. This means he saved $7.33 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $7.33, came from the tattered jeans.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation expert with extensive experience in managing large-scale events. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total capacity of the vehicles.

To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each vehicle and add them together.

The 4 buses have a capacity of 60 employees each, so their total capacity is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.

The 6 minibusses have a capacity of 30 employees each, so their total capacity is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.

The 10 minivans have a capacity of 15 employees each, so their total capacity is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570.

The final answer is: $\boxed{570}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a wildlife enthusiast and bird expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and Lillian buys 3 of them. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 x 20 = 60.

The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. She builds 3 of these feeders, so the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 x 30 = 90.

Now, we add the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

Final answer: $\boxed{150}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a food enthusiast and cost analyst. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item. The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5. The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"Hello there! I'm Yumi, a Pokémon enthusiast and expert in Pokémon card valuation. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine the total amount of money he made from selling the cards and then use that information to calculate the initial number of cards.

Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash, he must have made $50 from selling the remaining 2/3 of the cards. Let's use the selling price of $1.5 per card to set up an equation:

2/3 * 1.5 = 50

To solve for the total number of cards, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

1.5 * 3/2 = 50 * 3/2

This simplifies to:

2.25 = 75

Now, we can divide both sides by 1.5 to find the total number of cards:

2.25 / 1.5 = 75 / 1.5

x = 50

x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a food service management expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we need to calculate the total number of hotdogs needed for 40 guests to have two hotdogs each. Since each guest needs two hotdogs, the total number of hotdogs required is:

40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs

The caterer initially prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, which is:

36 guests / 2 = 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs

Since the caterer had 36 hotdogs, but needed 80 hotdogs for 40 guests to have two hotdogs each, we can calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog as follows:

80 hotdogs (required) - 36 hotdogs (prepared) = 44 hotdogs

However, this is the total number of hotdogs that were not provided. To find the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, we need to consider that each guest was initially prepared for one hotdog. Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

44 hotdogs / 1 hotdog/guest = 44 guests

The final answer is: 44"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a linguistics expert. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a shopping expert with a keen eye for discounts and calculations. Let's break down Charlotte's order to determine the final cost.

To calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the total cost of the items:
   - Pot and pans: $120.00
   - Mixing bowls: $20.00
   - Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
   Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

2. Calculate the 20% discount:
   20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

3. Subtract the discount from the total cost:
   $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"
"Hi there! I'm Yumi, and I'm here to help you with your math problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Dora wants to buy three items: a skipping rope for $6, a board game for $11, and a playground ball for $2. To find out how much she needs in total, we add the costs of the items:

$6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so we need to find out how much she has in total:

$2 (allowance) + $16 (from mother) = $18

Now, let's subtract the amount she has from the total cost to find out how much more money she needs:

$19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

The final answer is: $1"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fuel efficiency expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert 15 gallons to pints by multiplying 15 by 8.

15 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 120 pints

Then, we need to find 1/4 of 120 pints.

1/4 * 120 pints = 30 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to calculate the total amount he spent on candy bars. We know he spent $5 in total, which is equivalent to 500 cents. Since he had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of his money, which is 500 - (500 x 1%) = 500 - 5 = 495 cents.

Now, we subtract the cost of chips from the total amount he spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars: 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many he bought: 375 ÷ 75 = 5.

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"

"Bonjour! As a culinary expert, I'd be delighted to help you calculate the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup.

To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the ingredients. Antoine is doubling the amount of onions, so he needs 4 pounds of onions. The cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which cost $2.00 each. The total cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we need to calculate the time it takes for her to reach the theater and compare it to Wayne's travel time.

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 x 4 = 16 minutes.

Now, if Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne.

Final answer: $\boxed{21}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a home decor expert. I'd be happy to help you with finding the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom.

To find the perimeter, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width. We know the area is 360 square feet, so we can set up the equation:

360 = 9 * Width

To find the width, we can divide both sides by 9:

Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

Final answer: 98"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a home temperature expert. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To calculate the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to consider the temperature change due to baking and then subtract the cooling effect.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to baking:
Temperature change = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees

Next, we need to calculate the cooling effect. Since the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, we can calculate the cooling rate as follows:
Cooling rate = 2 degrees/10 minutes = 0.2 degrees/minute

Now, let's calculate the temperature change due to cooling:
Cooling time = 30 minutes
Temperature change due to cooling = 0.2 degrees/minute * 30 minutes = 6 degrees

Now, let's calculate the final temperature:
Initial temperature = 40 degrees
Temperature after baking = 40 + 15 = 55 degrees
Temperature after cooling = 55 - 6 = 49 degrees

The final temperature of Marcus's house is 49 degrees.

The final answer is 49."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sports analytics expert. I'll be happy to help you with this triathlon problem.

To find James' time for the swim, we need to calculate 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time.

Jon's swim time is 40 minutes. 10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, so James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

For the bike ride, James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon. Jon's bike time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. 
James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

For the run, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. Since Jon's run time is 50 minutes, James' run time must be 50 + 10 = 60 minutes.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a film analyst. Let's break down the information given to find the length of Movie A.

We know that Movie C was 1.25 hours long. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour.

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we're told that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C to find the length of Movie B.

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4 to find the length of Movie A.

80 minutes ÷ 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

The final answer is 20."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a culinary expert with extensive experience in baking and cooking. I'd be happy to help you with Rozanne's eggnog conundrum.

To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she has and then divide that by the number of eggs each tray can hold.

Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs, which is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. She also has 2 loose eggs, so the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Since each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, we can calculate the number of glasses Rozanne can make by dividing the total number of eggs by 5:
50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses

Now, we know each tray can hold 5 glasses of eggnog. To find the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by 5:
10 glasses ÷ 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to find the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. He sold 17 of them for $20 each, and the rest were sold to a department store for $25 each. 

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:
Revenue from selling 17 sneakers = 17 * $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the remaining 31 sneakers at $25 each:
Revenue from selling 31 sneakers = 31 * $25 = $775

Now, let's find the total revenue:
Total revenue = Revenue from selling 17 sneakers + Revenue from selling 31 sneakers
Total revenue = $340 + $775
Total revenue = $1115

The total cost is given as $576. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

The final answer is: $539"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a cinema enthusiast and a math whiz. I'd be happy to help you figure out the cost of the popcorn.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the cost of the super ticket is $20, and you saved $2 by not buying it. So, the cost of the movie ticket and popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $20 - $2 = $18.

We also know that the cost of the super ticket includes one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. So, the cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $18 - $1 = $17.

Now, we're given that the cost of the movie ticket is $12. To find the cost of the popcorn, we can subtract the cost of the movie ticket from the cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket: $17 - $12 = $5.

Since we know the cost of the soda is $3, we can confirm that our calculation is correct.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a gardening expert with extensive experience in designing and maintaining raised beds. When it comes to calculating the amount of potting soil needed, I always follow a simple yet effective approach.

To determine the total volume of soil required, we need to calculate the volume of one bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a raised bed) is length x width x height.

In this case, the dimensions of each bed are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one bed is 2 x 8 x 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 x 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Finally, each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 x $12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a magician's card enthusiast. I'd be delighted to help you with your question.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know there are 15 red cards in the set. The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. To find the number of green cards, we can calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15.

60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9

Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we're told that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards.

Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards.

Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a canine behaviorist. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to calculate the total number of puppies and the number of puppies with spots. 

First, let's add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has (8) to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has (12).

8 + 12 = 20

Next, we'll find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.

3 + 4 = 7

Now, we'll divide the number of puppies with spots (7) by the total number of puppies (20) and multiply by 100 to find the percentage.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a farm management specialist. I'd be happy to help you calculate the number of trips the farmer needs to transport the feed.

To determine the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each item and add them together.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 pounds. He also buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds. The farmer buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds. Lastly, he buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the feed by adding the weights of all the items together: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4400 pounds.

To find the number of trips the farmer needs to make, we'll divide the total weight of the feed by the capacity of the truck, which is 2250 pounds. 

Number of trips = Total weight / Capacity of the truck
= 4400 / 2250
= 1.96

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he'll need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the farmer will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a recycling expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Grayson recycles cans and bottles for money each week. An aluminum can is worth two cents and a plastic bottle is worth three cents. She drinks three aluminum cans of soda and five plastic bottles of water a week. To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate her earnings from aluminum cans per week: 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from plastic bottles per week: 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents.

Now, we add her earnings from both aluminum cans and plastic bottles per week: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, her total earnings in a month is 21 cents * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is 84."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a botanist with expertise in plant population dynamics. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Frederick has 10 plants, and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. To find Toni's plant count, we can calculate 60% of Frederick's plants and add it to his total.

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
= 10 + (0.6 * 10)
= 10 + 6
= 16

Now that we have Toni's plant count, we can find Shondra's plant count by subtracting 7 from Toni's total.

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
= 16 - 7
= 9

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a farm management specialist with expertise in animal nutrition and feeding strategies. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the amount of oats needed for Uncle Ben's horses.

To determine the total amount of oats required, we need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by all four horses and then multiply it by the number of days.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and Uncle Ben feeds his horses twice a day. So, the daily consumption per horse is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find out how many bags of oats are needed for 5 days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of oats needed by the weight of oats in one bag, which is 50 pounds. So, 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats for his horses for five days.

Final answer: 4"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a logistics expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to calculate the total capacity of the trays and subtract it from the total number of eggs.

Total capacity of the trays = 2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs

Since Jaime has 64 eggs, we can find the number of eggs that won't be placed by subtracting the total capacity from the total number of eggs.

Number of eggs that won't be placed = Total number of eggs - Total capacity of the trays
= 64 - 48
= 16

Therefore, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a shopping expert. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the cost of individual razors.

Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack. They're currently on sale for buy one get one free, and she also has a $2.00 coupon. To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to first find the total cost of 2 packs of razors.

Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack of razors is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we divide the total cost by 4, since there are 4 razors in a pack. The cost of each individual razor is $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this human pyramid problem.

To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each layer and add them together.

The bottom layer has 4 girls, and the average height of these girls is 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of the bottom layer is 4 * 64"" = 256"".

The next layer has 3 girls standing on top of the 4, and the average height of these girls is also 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of this layer is 3 * 64"" = 192"".

The next layer has 2 girls standing on top of the 3, and the average height of these girls is also 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of this layer is 2 * 64"" = 128"".

The shortest girl is 60"" tall, and she is at the top of the pyramid.

Now, let's add up the heights of all the layers: 
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 576""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
576"" / 12 = 48 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Brett's current age is 14 years. In four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. Since Angela will be three times as old as Brett in four years, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Angela's age in four years = 3 * Brett's current age
Angela's age in four years = 3 * 14
Angela's age in four years = 42

Now, we need to find Angela's current age. To do this, we subtract 4 from Angela's age in four years:

Angela's current age = Angela's age in four years - 4
Angela's current age = 42 - 4
Angela's current age = 38

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a pastry expert with extensive experience in baking Greek orange pies. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine the total number of pies they can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges available. Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, which equals 5 x 10 = 50 oranges. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

Now, let's add the total number of oranges: 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie requires 3 oranges, we can calculate the total number of pies by dividing the total number of oranges by 3: 120 ÷ 3 = 40.

Therefore, Brianne and Ashley can make 40 Greek orange pies.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the number of guests required for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to consider the total cost of each venue.

The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, plus an additional $5 per guest for food. The total cost of the first venue can be represented as:

C1 = 200 + 5x

The second venue charges $25 per guest, and since food is already included, the total cost of the second venue can be represented as:

C2 = 25x

To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we set C1 equal to C2 and solve for x:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

Therefore, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, an entomologist specializing in insect behavior and ecology. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the total number of insects collected is 43. We can represent the number of insects each person found using variables.

Let's say Bodhi found x insects. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We can set up the equation: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: 2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2: x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found: x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a knitting expert. Let's calculate the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma.

To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma. Since they used 1/4 and 1/2 of a skein, respectively, we can convert these fractions to equivalent decimals or find a common denominator to add them.

Let's convert both fractions to equivalent decimals: 
Mariah used 1/4 = 0.25 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 = 0.5 of a skein.

Now, we can add the yards used by both:
Total yards used = 0.25 + 0.5 = 0.75 skeins

Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we can multiply the total number of skeins used by 364:
Total yards used = 0.75 * 364 = 273 yards.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Suzie bought four packs of gum, with two packs being her favorite flavor, strawberry. She also purchased a pack of grape gum for $2 and a pack of green apple gum for half that price. The total amount she spent is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as x. Since she bought two packs, the total cost of strawberry gum is 2x.

The cost of the grape gum is $2, and the cost of the green apple gum is half of that, which is $1. So, the total cost of all the gum is 2x + 2 + 1.

We know that the total amount she spent is $7, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 2 + 1 = 7

Combine the constants on the left side:

2x + 3 = 7

Subtract 3 from both sides:

2x = 4

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 2

Since x represents the cost of one pack of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $2.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a carpentry expert with a passion for optimizing wood usage. When it comes to making popsicle sticks, I always look for the most cost-effective solution.

To determine the most cost-efficient way to make popsicle sticks, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber. Let's do the math:

For 2 x 4 lumber:
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For 2 x 8 lumber:
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since $0.015 per stick is less than $0.02 per stick, it's clear that buying 2 x 8 lumber is the way to go.

Now, let's calculate the maximum number of sticks Frederick can make with $24:
Number of 2 x 8 lumber = $24 / $6 = 4
Total sticks = 4 x 400 = 1600 sticks

The most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600, which is achieved by buying 4 pieces of 2 x 8 lumber.

The final answer is: 1600"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a nutrition expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the calorie deficit needed for Andy to lose 30 pounds in 7 months, we need to first determine the total number of days he has to achieve his goal. Since his birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st, we can calculate the number of days as follows:

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 31st, there are 0 days.
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to December 31st, there are 31 days.
February has 28 days (assuming a non-leap year), so from January 1st to February 28th, there are 31 days.
March has 31 days, so from January 1st to March 31st, there are 62 days.
April has 30 days, so from January 1st to April 30th, there are 93 days.
May has 31 days, so from January 1st to May 31st, there are 124 days.
June has 30 days, so from January 1st to June 30th, there are 154 days.
July has 31 days, so from January 1st to July 31st, there are 185 days.
August has 31 days, so from January 1st to August 31st, there are 216 days.
September has 30 days, so from January 1st to September 30th, there are 246 days.
October has 31 days, so from January 1st to October 31st, there are 277 days.
November has 30 days, so from January 1st to November 30th, there are 307 days.
December has 31 days, so from January 1st to December 31st, there are 338 days.

Therefore, from December 31st to July 19th, there are 338 days.

Since Andy needs to lose 30 pounds, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, we can calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn as follows:

Total calories to burn = 30 pounds x 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

Now, we can calculate the daily calorie deficit needed as follows:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calories to burn / Number of days
= 105,000 calories / 338 days
= approximately 310 calories/day

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 310 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds in 7 months.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a real estate appraiser. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the cost of the house.

To determine the cost of the house, we need to understand that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can set up the equation:

House cost + Lot cost = Total cost
3x + x = 120,000
4x = 120,000

Now, let's solve for x, which represents the cost of the lot.

x = 120,000 / 4

Chris has 100 math problems to complete. On Monday, he completes 12 problems. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems. The total number of problems completed so far is 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

To find the number of problems left, we subtract the completed problems from the total: 100 - 48 = 52 problems.

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 1/4 * 52 = 13 problems. To find the number of problems left to complete on Thursday, we subtract the problems completed on Wednesday from the remaining problems: 52 - 13 = 39 problems.

The final answer is 39."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a strawberry expert with extensive knowledge of strawberry cultivation and harvesting. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To determine the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy can pick 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour is 29."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a bakery management expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of loaves left, we need to calculate the difference between the initial number of loaves and the total number of loaves sold, and then add the number of loaves returned.

Initial loaves = 200
Loaves sold in the morning = 93
Loaves sold in the afternoon = 39
Total loaves sold = 93 + 39 = 132

To find the number of loaves left, we subtract the total loaves sold from the initial number of loaves:

Loaves left = Initial loaves - Total loaves sold
Loaves left = 200 - 132
Loaves left = 68

However, the bakery received 6 unsold loaves back. To find the final number of loaves left, we add the returned loaves to the loaves left after sales:

Loaves left after return = Loaves left + Returned loaves
Loaves left after return = 68 + 6
Loaves left after return = 74

Therefore, the bakery had 74 loaves of bread left.

The final answer is: 74"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a home energy auditor. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill.

To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her original weekly consumption and the new weekly consumption.

Ada's original daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. To find her original weekly consumption, we multiply this by 7 days:

Original weekly consumption = 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour. So, her original weekly bill is:

Original weekly bill = 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126

Now, let's calculate Ada's new weekly consumption. She's adding a device that consumes 2 kilowatts per hour. We add this to her original daily consumption:

New daily consumption = 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour

New weekly consumption = 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours

Her new weekly bill is:

New weekly bill = 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is:

Difference = New weekly bill - Original weekly bill
= $147 - $126
= $21

The final answer is: $21"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a professional painter with over 10 years of experience in the industry. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we need to first calculate the total number of hours it takes for one person to paint a whole house. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the total number of hours as follows:

Time = Total days * 24 hours/day
Time = 10 days * 24 hours/day
Time = 240 hours

Now, since 5 people can paint a whole house in the same amount of time it takes one person to paint a whole house, we can divide the total number of hours by 5 to find the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house:

Time = 240 hours / 5
Time = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, we can multiply the number of Ophelia's chairs by 3: 22 * 3 = 66 chairs.

Now, let's add the number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna: 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 108.

The total number of sofas and chairs is 108."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't purchased the headphone set, we need to subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount he paid.

Total amount paid = $48
Cost of the CD = $4
Cost of the headphone set = $44

Remaining amount = Total amount paid - Cost of the headphone set
= $48 - $44
= $4

Since the remaining amount is $4, we can calculate how many CDs Tom could have bought with this amount:

Number of CDs = Remaining amount ÷ Cost of one CD
= $4 ÷ $4
= 1

So, Tom could have bought 1 more CD if he hadn't bought the headphone set.

The final answer is: 1"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation expert with a focus on bus operations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, we have 48 passengers on the bus. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving us with 48 - 8 = 40 passengers.

Next, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving us with 80 - 21 = 59 passengers. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which is 3 times the number who got off (21), so 3 * 21 = 63. Therefore, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 + 63 = 122.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that James will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.

In 8 years, James' cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James' age. Let's calculate James' age in 8 years: 22 + 8 = 30 years. Twice James' age in 8 years is 2 x 30 = 60 years. Since his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James' age, his cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.

To find the current age of James' cousin, subtract 8 years from his age in 8 years: 55 - 8 = 47 years.

The age difference between James and his cousin is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for a total of $2,400. The cost of the printer is $400 less than the cost of the computer. Since the computer costs $1,100, the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we can find the total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

To find the cost of the two monitors, we subtract the total cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost of all three items: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are two monitors, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor: $600 ÷ 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a marine biologist with a specialization in shell identification and collection. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we need to first determine the total number of seashells brought by the girls. Since the boys brought 60 shells each and there are 10 boys, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

Now, we need to divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls. There are 10 girls, so each girl brought 300 / 10 = 30 seashells.

The final answer is 30."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that George had twice as many candies as Nick. If we let N represent the number of candies Nick had, then George had 2N candies.

We also know that George ate 5 candies, leaving him with 3 candies. This means that 2N - 5 = 3.

To find the number of candies Nick had, we need to solve for N. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:

2N - 5 + 5 = 3 + 5
2N = 8

Now, we can divide both sides by 2 to find N:

N = 8 ÷ 2
N = 4

So, Nick had 4 candies initially.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we're told that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. To find Anne's age, we add 2 to Alyana's age:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making his total $6 + $5 = $11.

The next day, he adds another $10 to his total, making it $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

To triple the amount he had left after spending $8, we multiply $13 by 3: 3 * $13 = $39.

Therefore, the eldest boy now has $39."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we first need to determine the total savings for the second half of the month. Since Elvis saves twice as much in the second half as he does in the first half, we can represent the savings in the first half as x. Then, the savings in the second half is 2x.

We know that Elvis's total monthly savings target is $1125. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 1125

Combine like terms:

3x = 1125

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 375

Now that we know Elvis saves $375 in the first half of the month, we can find the savings in the second half by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2 * 375
2x = 750

Since there are 15 days in the second half of the month, we can divide the total savings for the second half by 15 to find out how much Elvis has to save each day:

750 ÷ 15 = 50

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $50 per day in the second half of the month.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

We're given that Jeff and Brad are dividing $100 between them, with Jeff receiving 4 times as much as Brad. To solve this, we can use a simple algebraic approach.

Let's represent the amount Brad receives as 'x'. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's share can be represented as 4x.

The total amount they have together is $100, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Now that we know Brad receives $20, we can find Jeff's share by multiplying 4 and 20:

Jeff's share = 4x = 4(20) = 80

Therefore, Jeff receives $80.

The final answer is: $80"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a social network analyst. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To calculate the total number of families notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to understand the pattern of the sequence. In each round, the number of families notified is 3 times the number of families notified in the previous round.

Let's break it down:

Round 1: Ali calls 3 families.
Round 2: Each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 x 3 = 9 families are notified.
Round 3: Each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 x 3 = 27 families are notified.
Round 4: Each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 x 3 = 81 families are notified.

To find the total number of families notified, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

Total = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where a is the first term (3), r is the common ratio (3), and n is the number of rounds (4).

Plugging in the values, we get:

Total = 3 * (1 - 3^4) / (1 - 3)
Total = 3 * (1 - 81) / (-2)
Total = 3 * (-80) / (-2)
Total = 120

Therefore, the total number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a swimming coach with extensive experience in analyzing swimmer performance. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day, we need to first determine the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day. We know that on a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. On a hot day, he swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. So, we calculate the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day as follows:

Time on a hot day = 2 × Time on a cold day + 2
Time on a hot day = 2 × 16 + 2
Time on a hot day = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3 to find the time it takes him to swim 3 miles:

Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day = 3 × Time on a hot day
Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day = 3 × 34
Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day = 102 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a cold day from the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day:

Time difference = Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day - Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day
Time difference = 102 - 48

Zack's locker size = (1/2) × Timothy's locker size
Zack's locker size = (1/2) × 24
Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. We can represent this as another equation:

Peter's locker size = (1/4) × Zack's locker size
Peter's locker size = (1/4) × 12
Peter's locker size = 3 cubic inches

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a health and wellness expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we need to first determine how much coffee he currently drinks. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, and the daily recommendation is 4 cups, Octavia drinks 0.5 * 4 = 2 cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 2 * 10 = 20 cups.

The doctor has asked Juan to reduce his intake to 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract 4 from 20.

20 - 4 = 16

However, since the question asks for the reduction, we need to consider the difference between Juan's original intake and the recommended amount. The correct reduction is 20 - 4 = 16, but the question asks for the reduction, so we should consider the difference as 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

The answer is 16."

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a geographer with expertise in ancient structures and astronomy. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

The great pyramids of Sahir's house are indeed a fascinating topic. To determine the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to consider the initial angle and the rate of change.

The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house. To find the total angle after 10 hours, we can multiply the rate of change (5 degrees/hour) by the time (10 hours).

Angle after 10 hours = Initial angle + (Rate of change * Time)
= 32 degrees + (5 degrees/hour * 10 hours)
= 32 degrees + 50 degrees
= 82 degrees

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

Final answer: 82"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total cost of the candles, we need to determine the number of candles James needs and then multiply it by the cost per pack.

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. However, we don't need to consider their ages to find the number of candles. We know James has two sons, so he needs 2 * 5 = 10 candles.

Now, we know James needs 10 candles and each pack contains 5 candles. To find the total cost, we'll divide the total number of candles by 5 and multiply by the cost per pack.

Total cost = (10 / 5) * 3
Total cost = 2 * 3
Total cost = 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a book enthusiast and reading expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to break down the information provided. 

First, let's calculate the number of pages she read in the first week. We know she read for 15 minutes each night, which is equivalent to 15/1.5 = 10 pages per week. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read a total of 10 * 7 = 70 pages in the first week.

In the second week, we are given that she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first and second week.

70 + 100 = 170 pages

The final answer is: $\boxed{170}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's solve the problem step by step.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 1/3 of 12. 
1/3 of 12 can be calculated as: 12 ÷ 3 = 4.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 1/4 of 12. 
1/4 of 12 can be calculated as: 12 ÷ 4 = 3.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches.
12 - 7 = 5

There are 5 sandwiches left.

The final answer is 5."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into solving the problem step by step.

We're given that Shiloh is 44 years old today, and in 7 years, he will be three times as old as his nephew. We can represent Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

We know that S = 44. In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

The final answer is: 10"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. Then, for each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00. For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth.

To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to calculate the amount for the last two teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sports enthusiast and soccer expert. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark and 45 more goals than Anna. We can represent the number of goals scored by Mark as M and the number of goals scored by Anna as A.

We're given that Richie scored 80 goals. We can write an equation based on the information: Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20. So, we have:

80 = M + 20

Solving for M, we get:

M = 80 - 20
M = 60

Now, we can write another equation using the information that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna:

80 = A + 45

Solving for A, we get:

A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam, we need to calculate the difference between the total amount Mitchell made and the amount Liam made. We know Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we can multiply the number of lemonades by the price to find his total.

Let's calculate Mitchell's total:

21 lemonades × $4/lemonade = $84

Now, we need to find the difference between Mitchell's total and Liam's total. We know Liam made $63, so we can subtract this from Mitchell's total:

$84 - $63 = $21

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam.

The final answer is: $21"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down Peter's spending plan to determine the total number of action figures he'll have by the end of the week.

First, we need to calculate how much Peter spent on wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday. Since he spent $5 each day for 3 days, the total amount spent is:

$5 * 3 = $15

Now, let's subtract this amount from his initial $70:

$70 - $15 = $55

This means Peter has $55 left for the rest of the week. Since he buys plastic action figures at $2 each, we can calculate the number of action figures he can buy:

$55 ÷ $2 = 27.5

Since he can't buy half a figure, we'll round down to 27 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 3 wooden action figures and 27 plastic action figures.

The final answer is 30."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a gardening expert with extensive knowledge of rose cultivation and flower shop supply. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses required and compare it to the number of roses Ford grows.

First, we calculate the total number of roses needed per month:
Total roses per week: 20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses/week
Total roses per month: 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Since Ford grows 40 roses every week, we can calculate the number of roses he lacks per month:
Roses lacking per month: 260 roses/month - 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 - 160 = 100 roses

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

The final answer is: 100"
"As a financial analyst, I'd be happy to help you calculate the remaining amount in Katina's savings account.

To determine the remaining balance after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount withdrawn from the account. Since Katina withdraws $100 every month, we can calculate the total amount withdrawn in 24 months (2 years):

Total amount withdrawn = $100 * 24
Total amount withdrawn = $2400

Now, subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount in the account:

Remaining balance = Initial balance - Total amount withdrawn
Remaining balance = $3000 - $2400
Remaining balance = $600

Therefore, the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years is $600."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a food industry expert with a focus on food truck operations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the net profit, we need to consider the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. The food truck sells 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each. 

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost. The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the food truck needs 1 loaf of bread for 10 sandwiches.

Cost of bread = Number of loaves * Cost of bread per loaf
Cost of bread = 1 * $3.00
Cost of bread = $3.00

Additionally, the food truck spends $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches.

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a culinary expert with extensive experience in cooking and recipe development. I'd be happy to help you with Maggie's oven issue.

To determine the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. The oven is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees off. 

To find the percentage, we divide the difference by the original temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find 4% of 520. 
4% of 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

So, Maggie should set the oven to 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a charity event coordinator. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Judy initially bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 2 x 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

To find the total number of utensils, we need to add the number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend. The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a contact lens expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts and then divide it by the total number of pairs.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. To find the discounted price, we need to calculate 10% of $100.00 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $100.00 is 0.10 x $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 x $90.00 = $180.00

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes will contain 2 x 90 = 180 pairs.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs:

Cost per pair = $180.00 ÷ 180 pairs
= $1.00 per pair

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. Since she earns $10 per hour, her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. Since he also earns $10 per hour, his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sports nutritionist. I'd be happy to help you calculate the amount of water Hannah needs to drink after her workout.

To determine the total calories burned, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running. 

Aerobics burns 500 calories/hour for 2 hours, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.
Running burns 600 calories/hour for 1 hour, so the total calories burned from running is 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

Total calories burned = calories from aerobics + calories from running
Total calories burned = 1000 + 600
Total calories burned = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned.

200 calorie units = 1600 / 200
200 calorie units = 8

Since each unit requires 100 ml of water, we multiply the number of units by 100.

Total water needed = 8 * 100
Total water needed = 800 ml

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this jelly bean conundrum.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, and we need to find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans.

We know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can express this as an equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can express this as:

G = 1.01B

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the three colors, which is given as 4500. We can write this as an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

Now, we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the total equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

2B + 0.99B = 4500

Combine the B terms:

2.99B = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans:

G - R = 1.01B - 0.99B
G - R = 0.02B
G - R = 0.02(1500)
G - R = 30

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a seasoned e-commerce expert. When it comes to comparing prices, I always like to break it down to the nitty-gritty details.

To determine the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

Cost of boots on eBay = $13
Shipping cost on eBay = 2 * $4 = $8
Total cost on eBay = $13 + $8 = $21

Now, let's compare the total cost on eBay to the total cost on Amazon. The boots cost $16 on Amazon, and shipping costs $4. 

Total cost on Amazon = $16 + $4 = $20

To find the difference in cost between Amazon and eBay, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay.

Difference in cost = Total cost on eBay - Total cost on Amazon
= $21 - $20
= $1

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final answer is: $1"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a botanist specializing in plant growth and development. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

The problem at hand involves a beanstalk that doubles its height every day, starting from an initial height of 4 feet. We want to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to exceed the height of Mark's window, which is 20 feet.

To solve this, we can use exponential growth principles. Since the beanstalk doubles its height every day, we can model its growth using the formula:

Height = Initial Height * 2^(Number of Days)

We want to find the smallest number of days (n) such that:

20 = 4 * 2^n

To solve for n, we can rearrange the equation:

2^n = 20 / 4
2^n = 5

Now, we can take the logarithm base 2 of both sides to solve for n:

n = log2(5)

Using a calculator, we get:

n ≈ 2.32

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, it will take at least 3 days for the beanstalk to exceed the height of Mark's window.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a nutrition expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find the grams of protein he gets per day. Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, we can divide the total grams of mushrooms he eats per day by the grams of protein per cup to find the grams of protein per day.

200 grams of mushrooms / 3 grams of protein per cup = 66.67 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the grams of protein per day by 7 to find the total grams of protein per week.

66.67 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 466.67 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: $\boxed{466.67}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We're given that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. If we denote Jerry's current age as x, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

Final answer: 13"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a dental hygienist with over 10 years of experience. I'd be happy to help you calculate how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work.

To determine the total cost of the dental work, we need to calculate the cost of the implants and the crown. The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work:

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a geometry enthusiast. Let's dive into solving this triangle problem.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. We can represent the angles as x, 2x, and 3x, where x is the smallest angle. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

Since we're looking for the largest angle, the answer is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

First, we'll calculate the value of each type of coin: 
- 8 quarters = 8 x $0.25 = $2
- 6 dimes = 6 x $0.10 = $0.60
- 14 nickels = 14 x $0.05 = $0.70
- 15 pennies = 15 x $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: $2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy: $3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a pet care expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fitness enthusiast and personal trainer. I'd be happy to help you with Jamaal's weightlifting situation.

To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that, so we need to subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The final weight Jamaal uses is 10 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a gaming enthusiast and console expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total number of games Steve has after 3 years.

To determine the total number of games Steve has, we need to break down his gaming purchases into three categories: birthday gifts, monthly purchases, and Christmas gifts.

Year 1:
- Birthday gifts: 5 games
- Monthly purchases: 1 game/month x 12 months = 12 games
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- Christmas gifts: 5 games
- Total games in Year 1: 17 (previous) + 5 (Christmas) = 22 games

Year 2:
- Birthday gifts: 5 games
- Monthly purchases: 1 game/month x 12 months = 12 games
- Total games in Year 2: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- Christmas gifts: 5 games
- Total games in Year 2: 17 (previous) + 5 (Christmas) = 22 games

Year 3:
- Birthday gifts: 5 games
- Monthly purchases: 2 games/month x 12 months = 24 games
- Total games in Year 3: 5 (birthday) + 24 (monthly) = 29 games
- Christmas gifts: 5 games
- Total games in Year 3: 29 (previous) + 5 (Christmas) = 34 games

To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we add the total games from each year:
22 (Year 1) + 22 (Year 2) + 34 (Year 3) = 78 games

The final answer is: 78"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a flight engineer with extensive experience in aircraft performance analysis. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the additional time required to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

We know the plane's rate is 400 miles per hour, and the additional distance is 2000 miles. Plugging in these values, we get:

Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

Final answer: $\boxed{5}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a chocolatier with extensive experience in chocolate production. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours, we need to calculate their individual production rates and then add them together.

Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find his hourly production rate, we divide 120 by 2:

Ruiz's hourly production rate = 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates as Ruiz makes in an hour. To find Marissa's hourly production rate, we multiply Ruiz's hourly production rate by 3/4:

Marissa's hourly production rate = (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours:

Ruiz's total production in 12 hours = 60 * 12 = 720 pounds
Marissa's total production in 12 hours = 45 * 12 = 540 pounds

The total amount of chocolates they made together is the sum of their individual productions:

Total production = Ruiz's total production + Marissa's total production
= 720 + 540
= 1260 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"
"Let's break down Howard's spending over the three days.

On Monday, Howard spent $8 at the arcade. This is a straightforward amount.

On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 x $8 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 x $16 = $64.

To find the total amount spent, we add these amounts together: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Since Howard originally had $100, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount to find the amount left: $100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is $12."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating Patrick's earnings from selling lemonade.

To determine Patrick's total earnings, we need to calculate his earnings for each period and add them together.

For the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup.
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a tire expert with extensive experience in tire rotation and maintenance. I'd be happy to help you determine how long a tire will last.

To calculate the number of years a tire will last, we need to consider the total number of rotations it can undergo before needing replacement. Given that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations, and the car rotates 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the total number of rotations per mile as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, let's calculate the total number of rotations per month:
362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the total number of rotations per month by 12:
145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Finally, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the total number of rotations per year:
10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in approximately 6 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a personal finance expert. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the cost of each pump of shampoo.

To find the cost of each pump, we need to first determine the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. Since 2 pumps provide 120 washings, 1 pump will yield 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we'll calculate the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. To find the cost per 60 washings, we'll divide the total cost by 2.

Cost per 120 washings = $24.00
Cost per 60 washings = $24.00 / 2 = $12.00

To convert the cost from dollars to cents, we'll multiply by 100.

Cost per 60 washings = $12.00 * 100 = 1200 cents

Now, we'll calculate the cost per pump.

Cost per pump = 1200 cents / 60
Cost per pump = 20 cents

The final answer is 20."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fashion expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to calculate the discount on the shirt first. The original price of the shirt is $25, and there's a 30% discount. 

Discount = 25 * 0.3 = $7.50

The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Next, we add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: 
$17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the tax amount:
$52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20

The total cost of the outfit with tax is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Joe has $50, so he will have $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70 left after the purchase.

The final answer is: $-6.70"
"Bonjour! As a pastry chef and expert in croissant production, I'd be delighted to help you calculate the butter needed for Juan's bakery.

To determine the total amount of butter required, we need to calculate the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we can multiply the number of croissants by 1/4 to find the amount of butter needed per day.

4 dozen croissants per day * 1/4 pound per dozen = 1 pound per day

Since Juan wants to make croissants for 7 days, we multiply the daily amount by 7:

1 pound per day * 7 days = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants per day for a week.

Final Answer: The final answer is 7."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a civil engineer specializing in pavement design and construction. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To determine the cost difference between repaving Monica's and Lewis' streets, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street separately and then find the difference.

The cost per meter to repave a street is $194. Monica's street is 150 meters long, so the cost of repaving her street is:

Cost = Length x Cost per meter
= 150 meters x $194/meter
= $29,100

Lewis' street is 490 meters long, so the cost of repaving his street is:

Cost = Length x Cost per meter
= 490 meters x $194/meter
= $94,660

To find the difference in cost, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:

Difference in cost = Cost of repaving Lewis' street - Cost of repaving Monica's street
= $94,660 - $29,100
= $65,560

Therefore, it costs $65,560 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street.

The final answer is: $65,560"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a research scientist specializing in biotechnology and funding analysis. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total cost of John's research.

To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months. For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:

$100,000 x 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 x 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 x 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

We can calculate the funding for each of the remaining 5 months as follows:
- Month 6: $100,000 x 1.5 = $150,000
- Month 7: $150,000 x 1.5 = $225,000
- Month 8: $225,000 x 1.5 = $337,500
- Month 9: $337,500 x 1.5 = $506,250
- Month 10: $506,250 x 1.5 = $759,375

Now, we add up the funding for all 10 months:
$500,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $2,077,625

The total cost of John's research is $2,077,625."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a butcher and a meat expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat he sells in a day. As a butcher, I know that Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. So, the total amount of meat he sells per day is:

15kg/hour * 10 hours = 150kg per day

Now, we need to divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells per day (150kg) to find out how many days it will take him to sell the meat.

750kg ÷ 150kg per day = 5 days

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a student of mathematics. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to first calculate the total number of seats. Since there are 4 rows of seats with 18 seats in each row, the total number of seats is:

Total seats = Number of rows * Number of seats per row
= 4 * 18
= 72 seats

Next, we need to find the number of seats occupied by administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, so:

Seats occupied by administrators = Total seats * 1/4
= 72 * 1/4
= 18 seats

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by administrators from the total number of seats to find the remaining seats:

Remaining seats = Total seats - Seats occupied by administrators
= 72 - 18
= 54 seats

Since one-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, we can calculate the number of seats occupied by parents as:

Seats occupied by parents = Remaining seats * 1/3
= 54 * 1/3
= 18 seats

Finally, we subtract the seats occupied by parents from the remaining seats to find the number of seats occupied by students:

Seats occupied by students = Remaining seats - Seats occupied by parents
= 54 - 18
= 36 seats

Therefore, there are 36 students in the school auditorium.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

1. At school: Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

2. On the way home from school: Jim chews 1 piece of gum.

3. After dinner: Jim chews 1 piece of gum.

4. Total gum chewed: 4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum.

5. Initially, Jim had 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

6. Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a network engineer with expertise in internet connectivity and speed conversions. Let's break down Ashley's internet connection speed step by step.

To convert Ashley's speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to megabits per second (Mb/s), we use the conversion factor: 1 Mb = 1000 kb.

Ashley's speed = 20 kb/s
To convert to Mb/s, divide by 1000:
20 kb/s ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the speed by 60:
0.02 Mb/s × 60 s/min × 60 min/hour = 0.02 × 60 × 60 Mb/hour
= 72 Mb/hour

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb/hour.

The final answer is: 72"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation expert with a focus on tow truck operations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the total number of cars towed that week, we need to consider the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The final answer is: 54"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height and his current height, then divide that by his annual growth rate.

First, let's convert the required height to inches: 4 feet = 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, subtract Adam's current height from the required height: 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Next, divide the difference by his annual growth rate: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

Final answer: 4"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst with expertise in profit calculations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find James' total profit, we need to calculate the profit per car first. The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost: $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

Now, James got a 10% commission on the profits. To calculate his commission, we multiply the total profit by 0.1: 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a marine biologist specializing in wave dynamics. I'll be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of surfers who can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet, we need to calculate 25% of the total number of riders. This is equivalent to 0.25 * 100 = 25 surfers.

Since 60% of these riders are women, we can find the number of women who can stay upright by multiplying 0.6 by 25, which gives us 0.6 * 25 = 15 women.

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright: 25 - 15 = 10 men.

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

The final answer is 10."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a jewelry expert with extensive knowledge of precious metals and gemstones. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to first determine the prices of gold and silver jewels. 

The price of a diamond jewel is $2000. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so we can calculate the price of a silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding the prices of diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to determine the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

We know Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, let's add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

The final answer is 45."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation engineer with expertise in traffic flow and speed calculations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed between them. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph = -15 mph

However, since they are moving in the same direction, we should consider the absolute difference in their speeds. The negative sign indicates that Tom is moving in the opposite direction.

Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph

Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Final answer: 5"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fisheries expert. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

We're given that Naomi caught 17 fish, and we need to determine how many fish Tommy caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, we can calculate Darren's catch as follows:

Darren's fish = Naomi's fish - 6
Darren's fish = 17 - 6
Darren's fish = 11

Now, we know Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we can calculate Tommy's catch as:

Tommy's fish = Darren's fish + 3
Tommy's fish = 11 + 3
Tommy's fish = 14

The final answer is 14."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a karate instructor. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend while staying within the budget of $60. Since his parents won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we can divide the total cost by the maximum cost per class.

Let's do the math:

Total cost = $60
Maximum cost per class = $10

Number of classes = Total cost / Maximum cost per class
= $60 / $10
= 6

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, we need to find out how many he can miss before exceeding the maximum cost. To do this, we subtract the number of classes he's already signed up for from the total number of classes:

Number of classes he can miss = Total number of classes - Number of classes already signed up for
= 10 - 6
= 4

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"As a retail operations expert, I can analyze the situation and provide a solution.

To find the total weekly production, we need to calculate the daily production of both Julie and Jewel. Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total daily production is the sum of their individual daily production: 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sports enthusiast and running coach. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 x 4 = 20 miles. Since Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, we can set up an equation to find Lynn's distance:

Reggie's distance = Lynn's distance + 3
20 = Lynn's distance + 3

To solve for Lynn's distance, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

Lynn's distance = 20 - 3
Lynn's distance = 17

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a landscape architect with expertise in excavation and site planning. When it comes to calculating the time required to dig a hole, we need to consider the volume of the hole and the rate at which the soil is being removed.

To find the volume of the hole, we multiply the length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3.

Time = Volume * 3
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, and I'll be happy to help you with calculating the total cost of Bill's new truck.

To find the total cost, we need to add up the base price of the truck and the costs of the additional features. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The base price of the truck is $30,000.
2. The king cab upgrade is $7,500.
3. Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.
4. Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
5. The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating Tim's new salary.

To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise and bonus.

Raise: 5% of $20,000 = $20,000 x 0.05 = $1,000
Bonus: Half a month's salary = $20,000 / 12 = $1,667

New monthly salary: $20,000 + $1,000 (raise) + $1,667 (bonus) = $22,667

To calculate the yearly salary, we multiply the new monthly salary by 12:

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fashion expert with a keen eye for detail. Let's break down the costs of James' new wardrobe.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the suits. James buys 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost of suits is 10 * $750 = $7,500.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the dress pants. The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit, which is $750 * (1/5) = $150. Since James buys 10 pants, the total cost of dress pants is 10 * $150 = $1,500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and each shirt costs $60. So, the total cost of dress shirts is 10 suits * 3 shirts/suit * $60/shirt = 30 * $60 = $1,800.

Finally, we add up the costs of all the items: $7,500 (suits) + $1,500 (dress pants) + $1,800 (dress shirts) = $10,800.

The total cost of James' new wardrobe is $10,800."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a data analyst with expertise in calculating daily and monthly publication statistics. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a social media analytics expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Fishio initially received 2000 likes on her Instagram post. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. To find the total number of likes at that point, we multiply the initial likes by 70.

Total likes after 3 weeks = Initial likes * 70
Total likes after 3 weeks = 2000 * 70
Total likes after 3 weeks = 140,000

However, we're told that she received 20,000 more likes recently. To find the current total number of likes, we add these new likes to the total after 3 weeks.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. To find the sales from green hats, we can multiply the sales from red hats by 2.

Sales from green hats in the first month = 2 x $400 = $800

The total sales in the first month were $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find the sales in the second month, we can multiply the total sales of the first month by 3/4.

Sales in the second month = (3/4) x $1200 = $900

The total sales in two months were $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much was withheld from Sally's wage, we need to calculate the difference between her expected wage and the current bank account balance.

Expected wage: $300
Current bank account balance: $420

Since Sally's bank account balance is higher than her expected wage, it means that she received more money than she should have. To find out how much was withheld, we need to subtract the expected wage from the current bank account balance.

$420 (current balance) - $300 (expected wage) = $120

This means that $120 was overpaid to Sally. To find out how much was withheld, we need to subtract the overpayment from the expected wage.

$300 (expected wage) - $120 (overpayment) = $180

Therefore, $180 was withheld from Sally's wage.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst with expertise in aviation finance. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of owning and maintaining a plane.

To determine the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase price, monthly rent, and monthly fuel costs.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5,000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the monthly rent, which is $5,000 x 2 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is $5,000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a nutrition expert with a focus on food cost analysis. Today, I'll be helping you with a problem involving the cost of different nut combinations.

We have two mixtures: one with 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, and the other with 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. We need to find the difference in cost between these two mixtures.

To calculate the cost of the first mixture, we can multiply the cost of almonds and walnuts by their respective weights and add them together.

Cost of 1/2 pound almonds = 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture, we can also multiply the cost of almonds and walnuts by their respective weights and add them together.

Cost of 1/5 pound almonds = 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a farm animal expert. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20. We can use this information to set up an equation.

Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We can write the equation:

4s + 2g = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so we can write another equation:

s + g = 20

Now, we can solve for 's' by substituting the value of 'g' from the second equation into the first equation.

Rearranging the second equation to isolate 'g', we get:

g = 20 - s

Substituting this expression for 'g' into the first equation, we get:

4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s + 40 = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

20% of $5 is $1, so the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. 

7 pounds of the more expensive brand will cost 7 x $6 = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2.

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

Final answer: $44"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a personal finance expert. Let's break down Gus's grocery expenses to determine the cost of the apple pie.

To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent.

The total cost of chips is $4.00 (2 * $2.00). The total cost of the chicken and soda is $9.00 ($8.00 + $1.00). 

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the other items: $4.00 + $9.00 = $13.00.

To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a data analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Let's denote the number of newspapers delivered to District B as x. We know that:

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 198 + 209 = 600

Combine like terms:

x + 407 = 600

Subtract 407 from both sides:

x = 600 - 407

x = 193

Therefore, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

The final answer is: 193"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a culinary expert with extensive experience in cooking classes. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine the number of recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class. Since the class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, we can calculate the total hours per week as follows:

Total hours per week = 4 * 2 = 8 hours

Since the class meets for 6 weeks, the total number of hours is:

Total hours = 8 * 6 = 48 hours

Now, we know that John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find the number of recipes he learns, we can divide the total number of hours by 1.5:

Number of recipes = Total hours / 1.5
= 48 / 1.5
= 32

Therefore, John learns 32 new recipes during the 6-week cooking class.

The final answer is 32."

To find the number of math teachers, we need to calculate 40% of the total number of teachers, as the remaining percentage represents the math teachers.

Number of math teachers = 40% of 150
= 0.4 * 150
= 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
60 * 6
= 360 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's amount by multiplying Aurelia's amount by 3/4.

Kassidy's amount = (3/4) * 120
Kassidy's amount = 90

Now, we know Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we add 60 to Kassidy's amount to find Rayna's amount.

Rayna's amount = 90 + 60
Rayna's amount = 150

To find the total amount of money they have together, we add their individual amounts.

Total amount = Aurelia's amount + Kassidy's amount + Rayna's amount
Total amount = 120 + 90 + 150
Total amount = 360

To share the money equally among them, we divide the total amount by 3.

Shared amount = Total amount / 3
Shared amount = 360 / 3
Shared amount = 120

Therefore, each person would have $120.

Final answer: $120"
"As a sports enthusiast and basketball fan, I'd be happy to help you calculate the total game time.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a data analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Christina records her mood every day on a calendar for 30 days. We're given the following information:

- The first 8 days were good.
- The second 8 days were bad.
- The third 8 days were neutral.
- The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to calculate the total number of good days first. We can do this by adding the good days from the first three periods:

Good days = 8 (first period) + 3 (next period) = 11

Now, we need to find the number of good days left in the month. We can do this by subtracting the total good days from the total days:

Good days left = Total days - Total good days
= 30 - 11
= 19

The final answer is 19."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into solving the problem.

We're given that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. We can represent this relationship with an equation: 2x + 3 = 21, where x is the number of books Sally has.

To solve for x, we'll start by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18 ÷ 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a botanist specializing in bamboo species. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches, we need to first convert the target height from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the target height in inches as follows:

600 feet x 12 inches/foot = 7200 inches

Next, we need to find the difference between the target height and the current height. The current height is 20 feet, which is equivalent to:

20 feet x 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we subtract the current height from the target height:

7200 inches - 240 inches = 6960 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the remaining height by the growth rate to find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach the target height:

6960 inches ÷ 30 inches/day = 232 days

Therefore, it will take 232 days for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

Final answer: 232"
"Hello there! I'm Yumi, a dog behaviorist and animal welfare expert. I'd be happy to help you determine the total number of toys James needs for his doggie shelter.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, which means each dog needs one toy. This is a good start, but we need to consider the additional dogs in the shelter.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so the total number of dogs is 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs.
3. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys in total.
4. However, when James came back, he found that 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needs those toys. This means he needs 12 - 3 = 9 toys.
5. Since James initially had 4 toys, he needs to buy 9 - 4 = 5 more toys.

To find the total number of toys James needs, we can simply add the initial number of toys he had to the number of additional toys he needs to buy: 4 (initial toys) + 5 (additional toys) = 9 toys.

The total number of toys James needs is 9.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a structural engineer specializing in elevator systems. When it comes to determining the maximum load capacity of an elevator, we need to consider the weight of the people and any additional factors such as cargo or equipment.

In this scenario, we're given that the elevator's maximum load is 700 kg and there are 9 adults weighing an average of 80 kg each. To find the total weight of the 9 adults, we can multiply the weight of one adult by 9.

Total weight = 9 x 80 kg = 720 kg

Since the maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg, we need to subtract this from the total weight to find the excess weight.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

Therefore, the 9 adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

The answer is: 20"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a cookie connoisseur and expert in cookie dynamics. Let's dive into the world of cookies and solve this delightful problem.

We're given that Katarina has 68 cookies, which is 5 less than Max's cookies. To find Max's cookies, we can simply add 5 to Katarina's cookies:

Max's cookies = Katarina's cookies + 5
Max's cookies = 68 + 5
Max's cookies = 73

Next, we know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, to find the Cookie Monster's cookies, we subtract 12 from Max's cookies:

Cookie Monster's cookies = Max's cookies - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 73 - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 61

Lastly, Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. To find Summer's cookies, we add 23 to Max's cookies:

Summer's cookies = Max's cookies + 23
Summer's cookies = 73 + 23
Summer's cookies = 96

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies:

Total cookies = Katarina's cookies + Max's cookies + Cookie Monster's cookies + Summer's cookies
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
Total cookies = 298

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fashion designer with expertise in garment construction and measurement. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of the 50% extension and the addition of 20cm. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the final length of the dress is 140cm. We need to subtract the 20cm lace trim to find the length after the extension, but before the trim was added. 

Let's denote the length after the extension as x. We know that x + 20 = 140. 

Subtract 20 from both sides:

x = 140 - 20
x = 120

Now, we need to find the original length before the 50% extension. Let's denote the original length as y. We know that y + 0.5y = 120.

Combine like terms:

1.5y = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

y = 120 / 1.5
y = 80

The original length of the dress was 80cm.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into solving this problem together.

We have one set of twins and one set of triplets, with one twin being 7 years older than one triplet. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. We can start by denoting the age of the younger triplet as x. Then, the age of the older triplet is x + 7, and the age of the older twin is x + 7 + 7 = x + 14.

The combined ages of the twins and triplets can be represented by the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 14 = 7.67 + 14 = 21.67.

However, since we're dealing with whole numbers, we can round down to the nearest whole number for the triplet's age, as you can't have a fraction of a year. Therefore, the age of the younger triplet is approximately 7 years, the age of the older triplet is approximately 14 years, and the age of the older twin is approximately 21 years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Total coins Rong saves in a year = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Total coins Neil saves in a year = 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Total coins Rong saves in 10 years = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Total coins Neil saves in 10 years = 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a textile expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of squares, we need to determine the number of each color and add them together.

First, we know there are 14 red squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, we can calculate the number of blue squares as follows:

Blue squares = Red squares + 4
Blue squares = 14 + 4
Blue squares = 18

Next, we know there are 6 more green squares than blue squares. We can calculate the number of green squares as follows:

Green squares = Blue squares + 6
Green squares = 18 + 6
Green squares = 24

Finally, we know there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. We can calculate the number of white squares as follows:

White squares = Green squares - 12
White squares = 24 - 12
White squares = 12

Now, let's add up the total number of squares:

"Hello! I'm Yumi, and I'm here to help you with the class point calculation.

To determine how many points the class is missing, we need to calculate the total points collected by the students. 

First, let's calculate Betty's points. Since she collected 30% more points than Adam, we can calculate this as follows:

Betty's points = Adam's points + (30% of Adam's points)
= 50 + (0.3 * 50)
= 50 + 15
= 65

Next, we know that Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points can be calculated as:

Tom's points = Betty's points - 30
= 65 - 30
= 35

Now, we know that Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Marta's points can be calculated as:

Marta's points = 3 * Tom's points
= 3 * 35
= 105

Now, let's add up the points for all students:

Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Marta's points + Tom's points
= 50 + 65 + 105 + 35
= 255

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points from the minimum threshold:

Points missing = Minimum threshold - Total points
= 400 - 255
= 145

The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."

Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, making the total number of great grand-babies 9 x 3 = 27.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down Greta's expenses to determine how much she has left to spend.

To calculate the amount Greta puts into her retirement account, we'll find 50% of her paycheck: 0.5 * $2400 = $1200. Next, we'll calculate 20% of her paycheck for her car payment: 0.2 * $2400 = $480.

Now, let's subtract these amounts from her original paycheck: $2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720.

Greta has $720 left to spend."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's solve the problem step by step.

To find the number of pairs of pencils, we need to first find the total number of pencils in the box. Since there are 20 spaces for pencils and 4 are missing, the total number of pencils is 20 - 4 = 16.

Now, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 2 to find the number of pairs. 

16 ÷ 2 = 8

So, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fireworks expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah will see.

To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks in the city and the number of fireworks in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks in the city. Since there are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of fireworks per box:

15 boxes × 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300:

0.4 × 300 = 120 fireworks

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard. There are 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of fireworks per box:

3 boxes × 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks

Now, we add the number of fireworks Hannah can see in the city and the number of fireworks in her backyard:

120 (city) + 15 (backyard) = 135 fireworks

The final answer is: 135"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a food and beverage expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks.

To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks. There are 19 people in total, and each person consumes 2 drinks and 3 snacks.

The total number of drinks is 19 * 2 = 38 drinks.
The total number of snacks is 19 * 3 = 57 snacks.

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks is 38 * 2 = $76.
The total cost of snacks is 57 * 2 = $114.

The total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is $76 + $114 = $190.

The final answer is: $190"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a logistics expert with extensive experience in trucking and cargo management. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

Now, let's find out how much gravel the three trucks can carry together. We're given that the total capacity is 11,600 pounds. To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the combined capacity of Gissela and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity.

The combined capacity of Gissela and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. Subtracting this from the total capacity, we get:

11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2,800}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a culinary expert with a focus on Asian cuisine. Today, I'm happy to help you with the dumpling conundrum.

To determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, let's break down the information provided. We know that there are 8 males and 6 females, and each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male must have eaten 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

The total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32. The total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females: 32 + 18 = 50.

Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is 50.

Final answer: 50"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. To find out how much Gerald had initially, we need to find the total parts in the ratio, which is 3 + 2 = 5.

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, we can calculate his initial amount by multiplying his parts by the total amount: (3/5) * 100 = 60.

Now, Gerald spent $10 on a book. To find out how much he had left, we subtract the amount he spent from his initial amount: 60 - 10 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a wildlife biologist specializing in animal behavior and physiology. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we need to calculate its speed first. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is given as 15 feet/second. To find the turtle's speed, we'll divide this value by 5:

Turtle's speed = 15 feet/second ÷ 5
Turtle's speed = 3 feet/second

Now that we know the turtle's speed, we can calculate the distance it can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 3 feet/second x 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a firefighter and a numbers expert. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a hydrologist specializing in water resource management. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used for industrial purposes and then subtract that from 100%.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

So, the percentage of water used for industrial purposes is 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, subtract this from 100% to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes: 100% - 32% = 68%.

Therefore, 68% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Final answer: $\boxed{68}$"

To determine the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the number of weeks by 7.

Total days = 2 weeks * 7 days/week = 14 days

Since Alex charges $12 per day, the total amount she charges for 2 weeks would be:

Total amount = 14 days * $12/day = $168

The final answer is: $168"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a production management expert with experience in optimizing manufacturing processes. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the hourly production rates for each type of ice cream and then multiply those rates by the number of hours.

The chocolate ice cream factory produces 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its hourly rate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory produces 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its hourly rate is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total number of quarts made in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total quarts made in 48 hours: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

"Bonjour! I'm Yumi, a pastry connoisseur and expert in calculating the perfect pastry bill. Let's break down the costs of Marcus' order:

First, we need to calculate the total cost of each item:

- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Next, we'll apply the 10% discount: $50.00 x 0.10 = $5.00

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, and I'm here to help you with your ice cream conundrum.

Let's break it down step by step. The ice cream parlor is offering a deal where you buy 2 scoops of ice cream and get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50. To find out how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 2x + 0.5x = 6, where x is the number of scoops Erin buys at the regular price. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 2.5x = 6. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2.5:

x = 6 ÷ 2.5
x = 2.4

Since Erin can't buy a fraction of a scoop, we round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, she can afford 2 scoops at the regular price. However, considering the deal, she can get 1 scoop free for every 2 scoops she buys. So, she can actually get 3 scoops for the price of 2.

Therefore, Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream.

Final answer: 3"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. We need to find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

First, we calculate the total number of days in two weeks, which is 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a professional interior designer specializing in bathroom remodeling. When it comes to tile selection, I always consider the square footage of the space and the number of tiles required per square foot.

To determine the number of tiles needed to cover two-thirds of a 36 square foot bathroom, I'll calculate two-thirds of 36. This can be done by multiplying 36 by 2 and then dividing by 3.

(2/3) * 36 = (2 * 36) / 3
= 72 / 3
= 24

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, I'll multiply 24 by 24 to find the total number of tiles required.

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

576"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a gardening expert. Let's calculate the cost-effectiveness of picking blueberries.

To determine how much James saved by picking blueberries himself, we need to calculate the cost of buying them at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

The cost of picking blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself.

The final answer is: $10"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total amount of money the company paid for the computers.

To calculate the total amount, we need to find the new price of each computer after the 10% increase. 

The original price of each computer was $700. To find 10% of $700, we multiply $700 by 0.1.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers.

Total amount = $770 * 500

To avoid any calculation errors, I'll use the multiplication symbol (×) to represent the operation.

Total amount = $770 × 500

Total amount = $385,000

The final answer is: $385,000"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a dance expert with a focus on traditional Slovenian folk dance. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total number of taps Helga makes during her 5-minute dance, we need to consider the two scenarios: when her arms are at her sides and when they're raised.

When her arms are at her sides, Helga taps her feet at a combined rate of 550 taps per minute. Since she dances for 3 minutes in this position, the total number of taps is:

3 minutes * 550 taps/minute = 1650 taps

When her arms are raised, her tap rate decreases to 400 taps per minute. She dances in this position for 2 minutes, so the total number of taps is:

2 minutes * 400 taps/minute = 800 taps

To find the overall total, we add the taps from both scenarios:

1650 taps + 800 taps = 2450 taps

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a feline nutritionist. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the average time it takes for a cat and a dog to eat the sausages, we need to consider their eating rates. Since the cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes, we can determine its eating rate as 9 sausages per 30 minutes.

The dog eats the same number of sausages (9) in 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. To find the time taken by the dog, we can multiply the time taken by the cat by 2/3.

Time taken by the dog = (2/3) * 30 minutes
= 20 minutes

Now, we can calculate the average time taken by both the cat and the dog.

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. To make calculations easier, we'll convert this to inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches, then add the 4 inches, resulting in a total of 100 inches.

Now, we're told that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We can write the equation: 9x + 10 = 100.

To solve for x, we'll subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 9x = 90.

Next, we'll divide both sides by 9: x = 90 / 9.

x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a gum connoisseur and expert in the field of oral care. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we can use a simple division problem. We know that Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day, and we want to know how many packs of 15 pieces each he'll need for 30 days.

Let's set up the equation: 4 pieces/day ÷ 15 pieces/pack = number of packs needed

To solve for the number of packs, we can divide 4 by 15 and round up to the nearest whole number, since you can't buy a fraction of a pack.

4 ÷ 15 = 0.267 (approximately)

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we'll round up to 1 pack, but since 1 pack would not last 30 days, we'll round up to the next whole number.

So, Parker will need 2 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a campfire connoisseur and expert in s'mores logistics. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required. We have 9 kids and 6 adults, with each kid and adult consuming 2 and 1 s'more, respectively.

Total s'mores needed = (9 kids * 2 s'mores/kid) + (6 adults * 1 s'more/adult)
Total s'mores needed = 18 + 6
Total s'mores needed = 24

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 s'mores, we can divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed:
Sleeves needed = Total s'mores needed / 8
Sleeves needed = 24 / 8
Sleeves needed = 3

Now, since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we can conclude that 3 boxes of graham crackers are required.

= 38 years

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. We can represent this as another equation:
Mother's age = Father's age - 4
= 38 - 4
= 34 years

Now, we can find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
Combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
= 15 + 38 + 34
= 87 years

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a student council advisor. I'd be happy to help you with the student council election problem.

To find the number of votes candidate C got, we need to calculate the total number of votes first. We know that candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes. 

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, so candidate B got 20 + (50% of 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100. So, candidate C got 100 - (20 + 30) = 50 votes.

The final answer is 50."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Boris initially has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. To find out how many apples Beck has now, we add 10 to 77: 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To determine how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's current amount from Boris's current amount: 90 - 87 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a water conservation specialist. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract it from the initial 32 ounces.

Let's break it down:

Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Total water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a book enthusiast and a librarian. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Clara has 20 books, which is twice the number of books Steven has. To find out how many books Steven has, we can divide Clara's total by 2.

Steven's books = Clara's books / 2
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has by adding 6 to Steven's total.

Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we can subtract Alice's total from Clara's total.

Clara's books - Alice's books = 20 - 16
Clara's books - Alice's books = 4

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a retail analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar.

Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, we need to find the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a statistics enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are 50 students in total. We're given that 10 students like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. To find the number of students who like to play video games or music, we can subtract the number of students who like to bake and play basketball from the total number of students.

50 (total students) - 10 (bake) - 5 (basketball) = 35

This means 35 students like to play video games or music. Since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, we can set up an equation:

Number of students who like music = 2 * Number of students who like basketball
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we know that 10 students like music, so we can find the number of students who like video games by subtracting the number of students who like music from the total number of students who like video games or music:

Number of students who like video games = 35 - 10
= 25

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are 80 students in total, and the two classes have the same number of students. To find the number of students in each class, we can divide the total number of students by 2.

80 ÷ 2 = 40 students in each class

Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, we can find the number of girls in each class by multiplying 40 by 0.4 (which is the decimal equivalent of 40%).

40 * 0.4 = 16 girls in each class

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a cost analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much the vendor saves per day, we need to calculate the difference in cost between the old vendor and the new vendor.

The old vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day at $0.5 each, so the daily cost is 500 * $0.5 = $250.

The new vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day at $0.4 each, so the daily cost is 500 * $0.4 = $200.

The difference in cost per day is $250 - $200 = $50.

To find out how much the vendor saves per week, we multiply the daily savings by 7:

$50/day * 7 days/week = $350/week

The vendor saves $350 per week.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a business analyst specializing in operational planning and forecasting. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to consider the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. So, the total number of weekdays in 4 weeks is 5 * 4 = 20. Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in 4 weeks is 20 * 60 = 1200.

Next, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during weekends. There are 2 weekend days in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. So, the total number of weekend days in 4 weeks is 2 * 4 = 8. Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in 4 weeks is 8 * 100 = 800.

To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we simply add the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends: 1200 + 800 = 2000.

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out 2000 chairs in two 4-week months.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sticker and button expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. This means she trades 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers for large buttons.

After trading 27 small stickers, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. This means she trades 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers for large buttons.

After trading 20 large stickers, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

Now, she trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since she has 20 large stickers left, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a canine expert and breeder. I'd be happy to help you solve this puzzle.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that 1/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and 1/3 of those Pomeranians are girls. We're given that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can set up an equation: 
1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To solve for Total Pomeranians, we multiply both sides by 3:
Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Since 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up another equation:
2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the time Tatiana has for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time
Remaining time = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50\%}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 50 - 25 = 25 pencils
3. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 25 - 15 = 10 pencils

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum.

Time to drive to the museum:
Distance = 150 miles
Speed = 75 mph
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 / 75
Time = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home, we need to double the time:
Total time to drive to and from the museum = 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Adding the time spent at the museum:
Total time gone from home = Time to drive to and from the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time gone from home = 10 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a toy assembly expert. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the number of wheels left in the box.

To determine the total number of wheels needed, we need to calculate the number of wheels for the cars and the number of wheels for the motorcycles.

For the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels
For the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Total number of wheels needed: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Now, let's subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

The number of wheels left in the box is 276."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the discount on the laptop.

To find the amount you have to pay, first, calculate 20% of the original price of the laptop.

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$1000 - $200 = $800

You have to pay $800.

Final Answer: The final answer is $800."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a film enthusiast and expert in movie collection management. I'd be happy to help you calculate the cost of replacing your movie collection with digital versions.

To determine the total cost, we need to break down the process into steps.

First, let's calculate the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
Number of movies in series = 600 / 3
Number of movies in series = 200

Since Mike can get the series for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, we need to find the cost of the series:

Cost of series = Number of movies in series * $6
Cost of series = 200 * $6
Cost of series = $1200

Next, we need to find the number of remaining movies that are not in series. We can do this by subtracting the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
Number of remaining movies = 600 - 200
Number of remaining movies = 400

Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate the number of older movies as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of remaining movies * 0.4
Number of older movies = 400 * 0.4
Number of older movies = 160

The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so we can calculate the total cost of the older movies:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * $5
Cost of older movies = 160 * $5
Cost of older movies = $800

Now, we need to find the cost of the normal movies. Since there are 400 remaining movies and 160 of them are older movies, the number of normal movies is:

Number of normal movies = Number of remaining movies - Number of older movies
Number of normal movies = 400 - 160
Number of normal movies = 240

The cost of the normal movies is $10 each, so we can calculate the total cost of the normal movies:

Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * $10
Cost of normal movies = 240 * $10
Cost of normal movies = $2400

Finally, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies by adding the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies:

Total cost = Cost of series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
Total cost = $1200 + $800 + $2400
Total cost = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fruit enthusiast and expert in fruit pricing. Let's calculate the total cost of Winston's fruit purchase.

To find the total cost, we need to multiply the weight of each fruit by its respective price and add them together.

Peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
Plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
Apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Total cost: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a travel enthusiast and geography expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate the distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot.

To find the distance, we need to first determine the time they spent driving. We know they drove for 6 hours in total, and it took them 1.5 hours to hike. Since the time spent driving and hiking is the same, we can set up an equation:

Driving time + Hiking time = Total time
6 hours + 1.5 hours = 7.5 hours

Now, we can calculate their driving speed. We know they drove an average of 50 miles per hour. To find the distance, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 miles/hour * 7.5 hours
Distance = 375 miles

The distance to their vacation spot is 375 miles.

375"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them earned.

Assuming Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:

A = 10x + 5y + 30(60 - z)
E = 10(x - 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(60 - z)

where x is the number of enemies Emma jumps on, y is the number of berries Emma collects, and z is the time Emma finishes the level in.

We can simplify the equations by substituting y = 8 - 3 = 5 (since Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava) and z = 26 (since Emma finishes 4 seconds faster than Ava).

A = 10x + 5(5) + 30(60 - 26)
E = 10(x - 8) + 5(8) + 30(60 - 26)

Simplifying the equations:

A = 10x + 25 + 170
E = 10x - 80 + 40 + 170
A = 10x + 195
E = 10x + 130

Now, we can find the difference in their scores:

Difference = A - E
= (10x + 195) - (10x + 130)
= 10x + 195 - 10x - 130
= 65

The final answer is 65."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars, and two of them cost 30 dollars each. To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost.

Let's denote the cost of each of the other two pizzas as x. Since they cost the same amount, we can set up the equation:

2x + 30 = 64

Now, let's solve for x:

2x = 64 - 30
2x = 34
x = 34 / 2
x = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas costs 17 dollars.

The final answer is: 17"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. This can be calculated as 3 * 5 = 15.

On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual amount, so we multiply 3 * 2 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on both types of days: 15 + 12 = 27.

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes a total of 27 times in a week.

The final answer is 27."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fish expert. I'd be happy to help you solve the problem.

Let's break it down step by step:

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. He took out 14 orange fish and 3 white fish. Now, he has -11 orange fish and 1 white fish.

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

-11 = 2(1)

However, this equation is not true. Let's try again.

Let's say Bob took out x orange fish and y white fish. We know that the total number of fish he took out is 17, so we can set up the equation:

x + y = 17

We also know that the number of orange fish he took out is 14, so we can set up another equation:

x = 14

Now we can substitute x into the first equation:

14 + y = 17

Subtracting 14 from both sides gives us:

y = 3

So, Bob took out 3 white fish.

Now, let's calculate the number of white fish Bob had initially:

4 (initial white fish) - 3 (white fish taken out) = 1 white fish

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

-11 = 2(1)

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fuel efficiency expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to consider the total distance he travels and his fuel efficiency.

First, we need to calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he travels to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles per day.

Total distance traveled in a week = 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles

Next, we can calculate the amount of gas consumed per week:

Gas consumed per week = Total distance traveled / Fuel efficiency
= 50 miles / 10 MPG
= 5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of gas consumed per week:

Cost of gas consumed per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
= 5 gallons * $3/gallon
= $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Carrie was given 10 twenties and 140 quarters by her aunt to use for lunch. We need to calculate the total amount of money she paid for the lunch.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on the twenties. Carrie spent 3/5 of the 10 twenties. To find 3/5 of 10, we multiply 10 by 3/5:

(3/5) * 10 = 6

So, Carrie spent 6 twenties. Since each twenty is worth 20 dollars, the amount she spent on twenties is:

6 * 20 = 120 dollars

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on the quarters. Carrie had 140 quarters and spent all of them. Since each quarter is worth 0.25 dollars, the amount she spent on quarters is:

140 * 0.25 = 35 dollars

Now, let's add the amount she spent on twenties and quarters to find the total amount she paid for lunch:

120 + 35 = 155 dollars

The final answer is: 155"

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that one-fourth of the TVs sold are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. We also know that one-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to subtract the number of non-OLED TVs from the total number of TVs sold. The total number of non-OLED TVs is 10 (smart TVs) + 5 (analog TVs) = 15 TVs.

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 (total TVs) - 15 (non-OLED TVs) = 25 TVs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much money John is missing, we need to calculate the amount he needs to cover the trip. Since the school is covering half the cost, John needs to cover the other half.

The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school is covering half, John needs to cover $300 / 2 = $150.

John has $50, so he is missing $150 - $50 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a home heating expert. To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent his pipes from freezing, we need to calculate the temperature difference between the day and night, and then divide that by the heating capacity of one log.

The temperature difference is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we divide the temperature difference by the heating capacity of one log:

12 / 5 = 2.4

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the house is warm enough. Carson needs to burn at least 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

Final answer: 3"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a marine biologist with expertise in shell collection and analysis. I'm happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of seashells collected, we need to calculate the number of groups and the number of seashells each group brought back.

First, let's find the number of groups: 90 people / 9 people per group = 10 groups.

Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of 10 groups.

3/5 * 10 = 6 groups

Each group had 2 seashells, so we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought.

6 groups * 2 seashells per group = 12 seashells

Therefore, the total number of seashells collected is 12.

The final answer is 12."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation expert with extensive knowledge of train operations. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of people on the train after the sequence of events, we need to follow the order of operations:

1. Initially, there are 172 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so the number of people left is 172 - 47 = 125.
3. Then, 13 more people get on, so the number of people on the train is now 125 + 13 = 138.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down Jamie's earnings for last Tuesday.

To calculate her total earnings, we need to consider her regular and overtime pay. Her regular hourly rate is $20, and she worked 8 hours at this rate. For the additional 3 hours, she was paid at a special rate of 150% of her regular rate.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

For the additional 3 hours, her special hourly rate is 150% of $20, which is $30 per hour. So, her earnings for the additional hours are:
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

"As a zookeeper, I can confidently calculate the total number of lions in the enclosure. To do this, I'll start by determining the number of male lions. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, I'll divide the number of female lions by 2.

Number of male lions = 12 / 2 = 6

Next, I'll add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fashion expert with a keen eye for discounts and savings. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract that from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 x $40 = $10

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $40 - $10 = $30.

Now, we subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a human resources specialist with expertise in workforce management and compensation analysis. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to consider the initial number of employees, the number of new employees hired per month, and the salary per employee.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. To find the total number of employees after three months, we can use the following calculation:

Total employees after 3 months = Initial employees + (New employees per month * Number of months)
= 200 + (20 * 3)
= 200 + 60
= 260

Now, let's calculate the total salary paid to employees after three months. The salary per employee is $4000. We can multiply the total number of employees by the salary per employee to get the total salary paid per month:

Total salary paid per month = Total employees * Salary per employee
= 260 * $4000
= $1,040,000

To find the total salary paid after three months, we can multiply the total salary paid per month by the number of months:

Total salary paid after 3 months = Total salary paid per month * Number of months
= $1,040,000 * 3
= $3,120,000

The final answer is: $3,120,000"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate Billy's hourly wage after the two raises. His initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Since Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings will be 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 

Sally also works 20 hours, so her total earnings will be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a bot with expertise in environmental conservation and sustainability. I'd be happy to help you with the reforestation campaign at Ashley's school.

To calculate the total number of trees planted, we need to consider the number of students and teachers participating in the campaign. Each student plants one tree, and each teacher plants two trees.

Let's break it down:

Number of students: 40 classes × 25 students per class = 1000 students
Number of teachers: 40 classes × 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Since each teacher plants two trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 × 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

The final answer is: 1240"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a stuffed animal collector and enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to achieve a 30% ratio of stuffed goats to her total collection.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. Let's add up the number of each type of stuffed animal:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Now, we want to find the number of stuffed goats (x) that will make the percentage of stuffed goats 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. We can set up the equation:

(14 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.3

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get:

14 + x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

14 + x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 14 from both sides gives:

x = 0.3x + 0.2

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides gives:

0.7x = 0.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7 gives:

x = 0.2 / 0.7
x = 2/7
x = 0.2857

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 2 stuffed goats to make the percentage 30% of all her stuffed animals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Hello there! I'm Yumi, a gaming enthusiast and achievement hunter. I'd be happy to help you figure out how many hours Kris needs to play to earn her video game achievement.

To calculate the total hours Kris has played, let's break it down into two parts. In the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) every day. Since there are 14 days in 2 weeks, she plays for a total of 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

In the last week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day. With 7 days in a week, she plays for a total of 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

Now, let's add the hours played in both periods: 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. Since she has already played 21 hours, she needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours more.

The final answer is: 9"
"As a transportation engineer, I can analyze the situation and provide a solution.

When two cars are traveling at different speeds on a straight highway, the distance between them increases at a rate equal to the difference in their speeds. In this case, the first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour.

To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed × Time

Since the time is the same for both cars, we can calculate the distance each car travels and then find the difference.

Distance traveled by the first car = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles
Distance traveled by the second car = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

The distance between the two cars after 2 hours is the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:

Distance between the two cars = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, there will be 20 miles between the two cars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a jewelry expert with extensive knowledge of precious metals and gemstones. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total cost of the ring, we need to consider the cost of the diamond, the cost of the gold, and the premium. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. The total cost of the ring is the sum of these two costs.

Total cost = Cost of diamond + Cost of gold
Total cost = $600 + $300
Total cost = $900

The premium is 30% of the total cost. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.3.

Premium = $900 * 0.3
Premium = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the ring.

Total cost with premium = Total cost + Premium
Total cost with premium = $900 + $270
Total cost with premium = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring.

The final answer is: $1170"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math specialist. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the school's overall pass rate.

To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Let's break it down:

Third-graders who passed: 340
Fourth-graders who passed: 40
Fifth-graders who passed: 2 * 40 = 80 (since their pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders)

Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460
Total students in the school: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100
= 46%

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a mosaic artist with extensive experience in creating intricate designs with glass chips. I'd be delighted to help you with your question.

To determine the length of Milo's mosaic, we need to calculate the total area of the mosaic and then find the length. Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, we can start by finding the total number of chips Milo has.

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips. So, the total number of chips is:

2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips

Now, we can find the total area of the mosaic by dividing the total number of chips by the number of chips per square inch:

144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height:

Length = Area / Height
= 12 square inches / 3 inches
= 4 inches

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a tea connoisseur and expert in tea quantity calculations. Let's dive into the problem.

To find the initial amount of tea, we need to calculate the total amount consumed and add it to the amount left.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed. Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so they drank 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts. Additionally, 16 students drank 2 quarts each, so they drank 16 x 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the initial amount of tea was 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts).
48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, and I'm here to help you with your question.

Dale is selling butterscotch candies to raise money for his school club. He initially ordered 100 candies but ended up selling 150. Then, he ordered 100 more. To determine how many candies he still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Dale initially ordered 100 candies and sold 150, so he has 100 - 150 = -50 candies left. However, this is not possible, as he can't have a negative number of candies. This means he actually sold more candies than he had. To find the correct number of candies he has, we need to consider the candies he had initially and the candies he ordered later.

2. Since Dale initially ordered 100 candies and sold 150, he didn't have enough candies to meet the demand. To find the correct number of candies he has, we need to consider the candies he had initially and the candies he ordered later. Let's assume he had x candies initially. Then, he ordered 100 more candies, so the total number of candies he has is x + 100.

3. Since he sold 150 candies, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: x + 100 = 150 (initial candies + ordered candies = sold candies). Solving for x, we get x = 50. This means he had 50 candies initially.

4. Now, we can find the total number of candies he has: 50 (initial candies) + 100 (ordered candies) = 150 candies.

5. To find out how many candies he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has from the total number of candies: 150 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 0 candies.

Dale still needs to sell 0 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: 0"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a student counselor at the university. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of additional students who joined the campus by the end of May, we need to calculate the total number of students at the end of May and subtract the initial number of students.

Since the number of students doubles at the end of every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month as follows:

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles from 10 to 20.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles from 20 to 40.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles from 40 to 80.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles from 80 to 160.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles from 160 to 320.

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students, we subtract 10 from 320.

320 - 10 = 310

Therefore, the number of additional students who joined the campus by the end of May is 310.

The final answer is: $\boxed{310}$"

Average branches per day = Total money / Cost per branch
Average branches per day = $105 / $0.25
Average branches per day = 420

Since Felix worked for 7 days, we can divide the total branches by 7 to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a floristry expert. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total number of petals in the vase.

To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals Rose picked and subtract the number of petals she dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose picked:
3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Total petals picked: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many S'mores John and DeSean can make, we need to subtract the number of marshmallows they dropped from the total number of marshmallows.

Total marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Remaining marshmallows = 35 - 3 = 32

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the total number of S'mores they can make is 32.

However, they've already made 9 S'mores each, so we need to subtract those from the total.

John's S'mores = 9
DeSean's S'mores = 9
Total S'mores made = 9 + 9 = 18

Now, we subtract the total S'mores made from the remaining marshmallows.

S'mores left = 32 - 18 = 14

Since there are two kids, we need to divide the S'mores left by 2 to find out how many each can have.

S'mores per kid = 14 / 2 = 7

So, John and DeSean can each have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

Final answer: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have four players: Jack, his two friends, and one friend who is significantly better. 

Jack's playing time is 4 hours, which is equivalent to 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes per quarter, he will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

The two friends who are significantly worse than Jack play for half the time, so they play for 120 minutes each. This means they will use 120 / 20 = 6 quarters each.

The better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 1.5 * 240 = 360 minutes. This person will use 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

To find the total amount of money used, we need to add up the quarters used by each person: 12 + 6 + 6 + 18 = 42 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is 42 * $0.25 = $10.50.

The final answer is: $10.50"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a skilled perfumer and formulator. I'd be delighted to help you with your question.

To create a salt scrub, Tanya uses a combination of ingredients in a specific ratio. Let's break down the information provided:

- The amount of citrus zest and fragrance used is the same, denoted as x ounces.
- The amount of salt used is also x ounces.
- The amount of oil used is twice the amount of salt, which is 2x ounces.

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, we can set up the equation:

x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms:

5x = 10

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 2

Now that we know the amount of salt used is 2 ounces, we can find the amount of oil used:

Oil = 2x = 2 * 2 = 4 ounces

Therefore, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil in her salt scrub.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation expert with a focus on vehicle ownership and management. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away, let's break down the problem step by step.

Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

After selling 8 cars, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

After giving away 16 cars, Joe is left with 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity.

Total amount raised by charity = $175,000
Amount raised by organizations = $50,000

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
= $175,000 - $50,000
= $125,000

Since there are 20 students, we need to divide the amount raised by students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

Amount raised by each student = Amount raised by students ÷ Number of students

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a geography enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to first find the time she walked on the second day. Since she walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day, we can calculate it as follows:

Time walked on the first day = 8 hours
Time walked on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Total time walked in two days = 8 + 4 = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes)
Total time in minutes = 12 * 60 = 720 minutes

Therefore, Sandy took a total of 720 minutes to walk in the two days.

When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left. To find the number of cars that left, we multiply the total number of cars by 1/2: 70 * 1/2 = 35.

To find the number of cars left, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35.

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

The final answer is 35."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst with expertise in calculating daily and weekly earnings. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine John's weekly earnings, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a week and then multiply it by the payment per task.

Number of tasks per cycle = 5
Number of cycles per day = 30
Number of days in a week = 7

Total number of tasks per day = 5 * 30 = 150
Total number of tasks in a week = 150 * 7 = 1050

Payment per task = $1.20
Total payment per week = 1050 * $1.20 = $1260

Therefore, John's weekly earnings are $1260.

The final answer is: $1260"
"As a sports enthusiast and basketball analyst, I'll break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Sasha's points in the first game as S1 and Julie's points in the first game as J1. We know that Sasha scored 14 points in the first game, so S1 = 14.

We also know that Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so J1 = S1 - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. So, Sasha's points in the second game, S2, can be calculated as S2 = J1 - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from both games: Total = S1 + S2 = 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a feline nutritionist. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many more tins of cat food Kimberly bought than dog food, we need to calculate the total number of tins of each type of food. 

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food: 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins of cat food.

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food: 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we can find the difference by subtracting the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Hello there! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be delighted to help you with this Magic Card conundrum.

Let's break it down step by step. We have three friends - Becca, Smendrick, and PJ - with a total of 341 Magic Cards. We know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has. Let's use variables to represent the number of cards each person has.

Let's say PJ has x cards. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca, having 12 more than Smendrick, has 3x + 12 cards.

We can set up the equation to represent the total number of cards:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

So, Becca has 153 cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{153}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and add them together.

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together:
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a logistics expert with extensive experience in shipping and returns. I'd be happy to help you calculate the amount Milly will lose.

To determine the total cost of shipping, we need to consider both the weight and distance of the book. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. Let's calculate the shipping cost:

Weight: 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
Distance: 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate the refund amount:
Refund amount = 0.75 * $32 = $24

Now, let's calculate the amount Milly will lose:
Amount Milly will lose = Purchase price - Refund amount - Shipping cost
= $32 - $24 - $3
= $5

The final answer is: $5"
"Honorable question, I, Yumi, sensei of financial acumen, shall guide you through the calculation.

Mulan's initial funds are $40, and her father's generous gift adds $100, totaling $140. The cost of two pairs of jeans, each priced at $30, amounts to $60. Additionally, she purchases a bag for $20. To determine the remaining funds, we must subtract the total expenses from the initial amount.

Total expenses: $60 (jeans) + $20 (bag) = $80
Remaining funds: $140 (initial amount) - $80 (total expenses) = $60

Mulan has $60 left.

Final Answer: The final answer is $60."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a chocolatier with extensive experience in managing production lines. Let's break down Boris's chocolate production for the four weeks.

Boris starts with 50,000 bars of chocolate to produce each month. In the first week, he produces 8,000 bars. In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production.

Total monthly production: 50,000 bars
Production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars
Production for the fourth week: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

The final answer is: $\boxed{14,000}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a social media analytics expert. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the time Britany spends on TikTok in a month.

To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and add them together.

Time spent writing songs: 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours
Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes/week * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week. Converting 90 minutes to hours: 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours/week
Total time spent on TikTok per week: 8 hours + 1.5 hours = 9.5 hours/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the total time spent on TikTok per week by 4 to get the total time spent in a month: 9.5 hours/week * 4 weeks = 38 hours.

The final answer is: 38"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a professional interior designer with expertise in creating beautiful and functional spaces. I'd be happy to help you with the installation costs.

To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the items into standard and additional items. The standard items include 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of these standard items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. To find the cost of the additional items, we need to calculate the number of extra items:

- Mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 extra mirrors
- Chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 extra chandelier
- Pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 extra pictures

The cost of the additional items is:
- 2 extra mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
- 1 extra chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
- 10 extra pictures * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

The total cost for Angela is: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Eva has saved $20. Since Anthony has $10 more than Eva, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10
Anthony's savings = $20 + $10
Anthony's savings = $30

Now, we know that Roy has 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4.

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.4 x $30
= $12

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings.

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
= $30 + $12
= $42

Therefore, Roy has $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"I'm Yumi, a skilled ninja from the Hidden Leaf Village. I've analyzed the given information to determine Naruto's mountain-lifting capabilities.

Let's break down the information step by step:

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. We're given this as a base unit of measurement.

Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, which means Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a cycling enthusiast and speed expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total distance Mason traveled.

To find the total distance, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first 4 hours + Distance in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a wildlife biologist specializing in animal behavior and ecology. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles. Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can calculate the time it will take for them to travel across the highway by using the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

We know that 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours. Let's find the speed of one kangaroo:

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle:

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for 4 turtles to travel across the highway:

Time = Distance / Speed
Since we don't know the distance, we can use the fact that the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles. We can set up an equation using the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway:

Time taken by kangaroos = Time taken by turtles
18 hours = 4 * Time taken by a turtle
Time taken by a turtle = 18 hours / 4
Time taken by a turtle = 4.5 hours

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 4.5 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4.5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Kora made 20 clay dishes. Since Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, we can represent Rory's dishes as 20 + 20 = 40.

Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so we can represent Jada's dishes as 2 * 40 = 80.

To find the total number of clay dishes, we add the number of dishes each person made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes they all made together is 140."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down Erika's situation to determine how much money she has in her purse.

Erika wants to buy a laptop that costs $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400. She has some savings in her purse and has been paid $150 for her part-time job. Additionally, her mom agreed to give her $80 to help with the purchase.

To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the amount of money she has in her purse as x. We know that x + 150 (her part-time job payment) + 80 (her mom's contribution) = $400 (the new price of the laptop after trading in her old one) - $50 (the amount she still needs to buy the laptop).

x + 230 = 350

Now, let's solve for x:

x = 350 - 230
x = 120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a nutrition expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of apple slices, we need to calculate the number of slices from the large apples and the small apples separately.

First, let's calculate the number of slices from the large apples. Since 1 large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, 3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 slices.

Next, let's calculate the number of slices from the small apples. Since 1 small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, 5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Now, let's add the total number of slices from both the large and small apples. Total number of slices = 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Finally, Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 - 15 = 15

The final answer is 15."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a dairy expert with extensive experience in cattle management. To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to calculate the total milk production required and then divide it by the milk production per cow.

The farmer currently has 3 cows, each producing 5 liters of milk per day. To find the total milk production, we multiply the number of cows by the milk production per cow:

3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters/day

Since the farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk per day, we need to find out how many cows are required to achieve this. We can do this by dividing the desired milk production by the milk production per cow:

25 liters / 5 liters/cow = 5 cows

However, the farmer already has 3 cows, so we need to find out how many more cows he needs to add:

5 cows (required) - 3 cows (existing) = 2 cows

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

Final answer: 2"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a glue stick expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 5/6 by the original length of 12 mm:
(5/6) * 12 = 10 mm

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/3 by the original length of 12 mm:
(1/3) * 12 = 4 mm

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/2 by the original length of 12 mm:
(1/2) * 12 = 6 mm

Now, we add the lengths of the used parts together:
10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 mm."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we need to divide the total number of students (27) by the number of glue sticks per pack (8).

27 ÷ 8 = 3.375

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks. This is because 3.375 is more than 3, but we can't buy a fraction of a pack.

To round up, we can add 1 to the whole number part (3) and keep the decimal part (0.375). This gives us 4.

So, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 4 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a hydrologist specializing in river flow dynamics. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We're given that the initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. On the second day, the amount doubles, resulting in 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons. 

On the third day, the amount increases by 6000 gallons, so we add 6000 to the previous day's amount: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

Final answer: 14000"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a epidemiologist specializing in infectious disease modeling. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To calculate the number of people infected after three days, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The initial number of infected people is 10, and each infected person infects 6 others, resulting in a daily increase of 6 times the previous day's infected individuals.

Let's break it down:

Day 1: 10 (initial) + 10 * 6 (new infections) = 10 + 60 = 70
Day 2: 70 (previous) + 70 * 6 (new infections) = 70 + 420 = 490
Day 3: 490 (previous) + 490 * 6 (new infections) = 490 + 2940 = 3430

Using the formula for exponential growth, we can also represent this as:

S(t) = S0 * (r)^t

where S(t) is the total number of infected people at time t, S0 is the initial number of infected people (10), r is the daily growth rate (6), and t is the number of days.

S(3) = 10 * (6)^3
S(3) = 10 * 216
S(3) = 2160

However, this calculation assumes that the initial 10 people are not already infected, but rather that they are the first wave of infections. Since the problem states that the plague infects 10 people, we need to adjust the calculation to account for the initial infections.

The correct calculation is:

S(3) = 10 + 10 * (6)^2 + 10 * (6)^3
S(3) = 10 + 60 + 2160
S(3) = 2330

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: 3430"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a restaurant management expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we need to calculate the tips each of them received.

Rafaela received 40 tips of $20 each, so she received 40 * $20 = $800.

Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela, which is 90% of what Rafaela received. To find 90% of $800, we multiply $800 by 0.9: 0.9 * $800 = $720.

The total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela is $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's solve the problem step by step.

To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so 3 x 2 = 6 oranges were given to the daughters.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.
Total oranges given away = 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, subtract the total oranges given away from the total oranges bought:
12 - 9 = 3

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this question.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a baking enthusiast and expert in calculating the financial impact of baked goods sales. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine the total amount raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since Paige baked 10 loaves and each loaf is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Now, we know each slice is sold for $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

Therefore, Paige raised a total of $40 in the fundraiser.

The final answer is: $40"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

We're given that Gretchen has some coins, with 30 more gold coins than silver coins. We know she has 70 gold coins. To find the total number of coins, we need to determine the number of silver coins first.

Let's use algebra to solve for the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as x + 30. We're given that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for x, we subtract 30 from both sides:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver)
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math teacher. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, we can multiply the number of students by the number of burritos each student received:

50 students × 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos

However, Mr. George ate 20 burritos, so we need to subtract those from the total:

500 burritos - 20 burritos = 480 burritos

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos is 480.

The final answer is 480."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a roller rink enthusiast and expert in bumper car management. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars.

The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars. Since there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is:
12 - 2 = 10

The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. So, the number of blue cars is:
3 * 10 = 30

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:
12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52

Since the total number of cars is 75, the number of yellow cars can be found by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total:
75 - 52 = 23

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23.

The final answer is 23."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a book enthusiast and a math whiz. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have a total of 85 books. We can represent the number of books each person has with variables.

Let's say Fawn has x books. Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 books.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of books:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a nutrition expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is: 7"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a party planning expert. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the cost of jello for your son's outdoor birthday party.

Total cups needed: 120
Cups per box: 10
Number of boxes needed: 120 / 10 = 12

Now, we need to multiply the number of boxes needed by the price per box to find the total cost.

The seller gave $4000 in total. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount given:

$4000 - $3500 = $500

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

40% of $400 is calculated as 0.4 x $400 = $160. 

To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide the monthly amount by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month). 

$160 ÷ 4 = $40.

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

The final answer is $40."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.
7/13 * 26 = 14.31 (round down to 14 since you can't eat a fraction of a piece)

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

Final answer: 48"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a poultry expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine the cost price of the chickens, we need to calculate the total revenue Isaias will generate from selling 180 chickens at $50 each and then subtract the desired profit of $2000.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:

Revenue = Number of chickens sold * Price per chicken
= 180 * $50
= $9000

Now, to find the cost price, we subtract the desired profit from the total revenue:

Cost price = Revenue - Desired profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we need to first determine the number of glasses each of them sold. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the boys sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses sold by 3.

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people selling = 3

Glasses sold per person = Total glasses sold / Number of people selling
= 32 / 3
= 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses.

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales:

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. To find her present age, we subtract 10 from 18:

18 - 10 = 8

Now, we need to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age. Thrice her present age is 3 times 8, which is:

3 × 8 = 24

Since she is currently 8 years old, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be 24. We can set up an equation:

Current age + x = 24

We know her current age is 8, so we can substitute that in:

8 + x = 24

To solve for x, we subtract 8 from both sides:

x = 24 - 8
x = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: 16"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a grocery shopping expert. Let's break down Kelly's expenses to determine how much she has left in her budget.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart. The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 x 2 = $12.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the strawberries and apples. The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 x $4 = $12. Since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, the cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 x $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$10 + $12 + $12 + $14 = $48

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
$65 - $48 = $17

Therefore, Kelly has $17 left in her budget."
"As a concert promoter and event planner, I've had the pleasure of working with Elaina on several occasions. When it comes to calculating the runtime of her usual concerts, I always consider the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, and then work backwards to determine the base runtime.

Let's break it down:

Total runtime of the final concert = 65 minutes
Encore time = 15 minutes
Runtime of the final concert without encore = 65 - 15 = 50 minutes

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can set up the equation:

2(x) = 50, where x represents the runtime of the usual concert

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"

Argo initially had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the total number of toys he gave away from the initial number of toys.

Total toys given away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Number of toys Argo has now: 200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

Final answer: 50"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a food enthusiast and expert in culinary calculations. Let's dive into the world of chimichangas!

To determine the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to calculate the total production for each day and then add them together.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas each day. To find the total for these two days, we can multiply the number of chimichangas made on each day by 2, since they make the same amount on both days. This gives us 2 x 125 = 250 chimichangas.

On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, so they make 2 x 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a stage manager with extensive experience in event planning and logistics. I'd be happy to help you with arranging the microphones.

To determine the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we need to first find the number of microphones that can fit. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs, we can calculate the number of microphones that won't fit as 20% of the total number of microphones.

Let's calculate the number of microphones that won't fit: 20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10.

The number of microphones that can fit in pairs is the total number of microphones minus the number of microphones that won't fit: 50 - 10 = 40.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is 40 / 2 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a wildlife enthusiast and ornithologist. I'd be happy to help you with the bird count.

To calculate the total number of birds, we need to break it down into three groups: birds in the bushes, birds flying overhead, and birds feeding.

First, let's calculate the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds in the bushes are flying overhead, we can calculate this as:

(2/3) * 6 = 4

Next, we have 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds per group:

3 * 8 = 24

Now, let's add up the total number of birds:

6 (in the bushes) + 4 (flying overhead) + 24 (feeding) = 34

Therefore, Jerry counts a total of 34 birds.

The final answer is: 34"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a baking enthusiast and cookie connoisseur. I'd be delighted to help you with this problem.

To determine the number of cookies in each jar, we need to subtract the number of cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies she baked.

Total cookies baked = 55
Cookies eaten = 5

Cookies left = Total cookies baked - Cookies eaten
Cookies left = 55 - 5
Cookies left = 50

Since Lani placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we can divide the remaining cookies by 5.

Cookies in each jar = Cookies left / 5
Cookies in each jar = 50 / 5
Cookies in each jar = 10

The final answer is 10."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a botanist specializing in orchids and flowers. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the difference in the number of petals between the orchids and daisies, we need to calculate the total number of petals on each type of flower.

The orchids have 5 petals per flower, and there are 5 orchids. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is 5 * 5 = 25 petals.

The daisies have 10 petals per flower, and there are 4 daisies. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is 4 * 10 = 40 petals.

To find the difference in the number of petals, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 - 25 = 15 petals.

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a botanist with expertise in plant classification and garden management. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Mrs. Smith has 100 plants in her garden. One-fourth of these are indoor plants. To find the number of indoor plants, we can calculate:

Number of indoor plants = Total number of plants * (1/4)
= 100 * (1/4)
= 25

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find the remaining plants:

Remaining plants = Total number of plants - Number of indoor plants
= 100 - 25
= 75

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. To find the number of outdoor plants, we can calculate:

Number of outdoor plants = Remaining plants * (2/3)
= 75 * (2/3)
= 50

Finally, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants:

Number of flowering plants = Remaining plants - Number of outdoor plants
= 75 - 50
= 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we can divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:

Percentage of flowering plants = (Number of flowering plants / Total number of plants) * 100
= (25 / 100) * 100
= 25%

Therefore, 25% of Mrs. Smith's plants are flowering plants.

The final answer is 25%."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a mechanical engineer with expertise in rotational motion and kinematics. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to understand the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig and the thingamabob. We're given that the whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob and that the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob.

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster, its speed is 11x. We're also given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. We can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins five times faster. So, the speed of the whirligig is:

Speed of whirligig = 5x
= 5 * 11
= 55 meters per second

Therefore, the whirligig spins at 55 meters per second.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a nutrition expert. Let's break down Ellen's daily expenses to determine the cost of one carrot.

Ellen's daily expenses consist of two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad. To find the cost of the yogurt, we can calculate it as follows:

Cost of yogurt = Cost of salad / 2
Cost of yogurt = $6 / 2
Cost of yogurt = $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt:
Total cost of salad and yogurt = Cost of salad + Cost of yogurt
Total cost of salad and yogurt = $6 + $3
Total cost of salad and yogurt = $9

Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is:
Cost of carrots = Total daily expenses - Total cost of salad and yogurt
Cost of carrots = $11 - $9
Cost of carrots = $2

Therefore, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find Mark's new weekly income, we need to calculate his hourly wage first. His original wage was $10 per hour, and it increased by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is:

$10 + $2 = $12 per hour

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we can multiply his hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

$12 per hour * 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = $480 per week

Therefore, Mark's new weekly income is $480."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she earned from mowing lawns. We know that she mowed Joe's lawn x times, Kamala's lawn 3x times, and Alba's lawn 5x times. Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is 6x.

We are given that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation:

6x = 80

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6:

x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now, we can find the total amount she earned from mowing lawns:
6x = 6 * 13
6x = 78

To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the amount she earned from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
80 - 78 = 2

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a nutrition expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We're given the weights of four individuals: Martin, Carl, Christian, and Harry. We know that Martin weighs 55 kg. 

Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.

Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.

Now, we need to find Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's. So, Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: $\boxed{74}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate John's profit, we need to first find his total monthly earnings from renting out his car. Since he rents it out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, and he gets paid $25 per hour, we can calculate his total earnings as follows:

Total hours worked per month = 10 hours * 3 hours = 30 hours
Total earnings per month = 30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Now, we subtract his car payment of $500 from his total earnings to find his profit:

Total profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Total profit = $750 - $500
Total profit = $250

Therefore, John's monthly profit from renting out his car is $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into the problem.

To solve this, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. We know Martha bought 5 more notebooks, making her total 7. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha initially, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Joseph had x notebooks.
Martha had 3x notebooks.

Since Martha had 7 notebooks, we can set up the equation:
3x = 7

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:
x = 7 / 3
x = 2.33 (approximately)

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has approximately 2.33 notebooks. To find the difference, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:
7 - 2.33 = 4.67

So, Martha has 4.67 more notebooks than Joseph.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a geography enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis.

To find the total distance rowed by both of them, we need to calculate Anis' distance first. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:

Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both of them:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Denise and Daniel are reading the same book. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages while Daniel read 13 pages. To find the difference in pages read by Denise and Daniel yesterday, we subtract the number of pages read by Denise from the number of pages read by Daniel: 13 - 10 = 3 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, Denise read 5 more pages than the 13 pages Daniel read yesterday. So, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total pages read by both of them. Yesterday, they read 10 + 13 = 23 pages. Today, Denise read 18 pages. So, the total pages read by both of them is 23 + 18 = 41 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise: 41 - 23 = 18 pages.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a textile expert with extensive experience in calculating fabric requirements for various crafting projects. I'd be happy to help you determine the amount of material needed for Jo's face masks.

To calculate the total material required, we need to calculate the material needed for small and large masks separately.

For small masks, we know that 4 small masks can be made with 2 yards of material. To find the material needed for 20 small masks, we can divide the total number of masks by the number of masks that can be made with 2 yards of material:

20 small masks ÷ 4 small masks/2 yards = 20 ÷ 4 = 5 sets of 2 yards

Since each set requires 2 yards, we multiply the number of sets by 2:

5 sets × 2 yards/set = 10 yards

For large masks, we know that 3 large masks can be made with 2.25 yards of material. To find the material needed for 8 large masks, we can divide the total number of masks by the number of masks that can be made with 2.25 yards of material:

8 large masks ÷ 3 large masks/2.25 yards = 8 ÷ 3 = 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards

Since we can't buy a fraction of a yard, we'll round up to the nearest whole number to ensure we have enough material. In this case, we'll round up to 3 sets of 2.25 yards:

2.67 sets → 3 sets

Now, we multiply the number of sets by 2.25 yards:

3 sets × 2.25 yards/set = 6.75 yards

To be safe, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, as we can't buy a fraction of a yard:

6.75 yards → 7 yards

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks:

10 yards (for small masks) + 7 yards (for large masks) = 17 yards

Therefore, Jo would need 17 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

The final answer is: 17"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a time management expert. Let's break down Harold's daily schedule to determine his free time.

First, we need to calculate the total hours in a day: 24 hours.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, which is 10 hours out of the 24-hour day. To find the remaining hours, we subtract his sleep time from the total hours: 24 - 10 = 14 hours.

Next, we need to calculate the hours Harold spends on his daily activities. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours. Additionally, he walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, let's add up the hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours.

To find Harold's free time, we subtract the total hours spent on activities from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a shoe box enthusiast and expert in shoe box management. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the number of blue shoe boxes left, we need to subtract the number of blue shoe boxes used from the total number of blue shoe boxes. Let's do the math:

Total blue shoe boxes: 7
Blue shoe boxes used: 3

Blue shoe boxes left = Total blue shoe boxes - Blue shoe boxes used
Blue shoe boxes left = 7 - 3
Blue shoe boxes left = 4

Now, let's calculate the number of red shoe boxes left. We know that 1/3 of the red shoe boxes were used. To find the number of red shoe boxes used, we can multiply the total number of red shoe boxes by 1/3:

Total red shoe boxes: 9
Red shoe boxes used = 1/3 * 9
Red shoe boxes used = 3

Now, subtract the number of red shoe boxes used from the total number of red shoe boxes:

Red shoe boxes left = Total red shoe boxes - Red shoe boxes used
Red shoe boxes left = 9 - 3
Red shoe boxes left = 6

To find the number of books Joseph currently has, we need to calculate the difference between the number of books he initially had and the number he lost.

Joseph had twice the number of books Sarah had, and Sarah had 9 books. So, Joseph initially had 2 * 9 = 18 books.

Since Joseph lost 2 books, we subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had.

18 - 2 = 16

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to calculate the total marbles he gave away and subtract that from his initial amount.

Dean gave 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since he has 30 marbles, we can calculate 1/5 of 30 as follows:

1/5 * 30 = 6

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, we add the 10 marbles he gave to Donald:

6 (given to Jamie) + 10 (given to Donald) = 16

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the total:

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is 14."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We're given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. We can represent Duncan's current age as 'D' and Adam's current age as 'A'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can set up the equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We're also given that Duncan's current age is 60, so we can substitute D = 60 into the equation:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A by adding 8 to both sides of the equation:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A

Divide both sides by 2 to find A:

A = 60 / 2
A = 30

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a farm management specialist. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total number of acres of the two farms, we need to first find the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 

So, twice that of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 x 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 
200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a packaging specialist with expertise in manufacturing operations. I'd be happy to help you with Colby's earnings.

To calculate Colby's daily earnings, we need to first determine the number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday. Since he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we can calculate his hourly production as follows:

Packages per hour = 50 - 10 = 40

Now, let's calculate his total packages completed in 8 hours:

Total packages = Packages per hour * 8
Total packages = 40 * 8
Total packages = 320

As Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package, his daily earnings can be calculated as:

Daily earnings = Total packages * $0.20
Daily earnings = 320 * 0.20
Daily earnings = $64

Therefore, Colby earns $64 in a typical 8-hour workday.

The final answer is: $64"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a puzzle enthusiast and sudoku expert. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To calculate the number of bottles of water John drinks, we need to determine the total time he spends on sudoku puzzles. A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, which is 4 * 45 = 180 minutes.

The total time spent on sudoku is the sum of the time for a normal sudoku and an extreme sudoku: 45 minutes + 180 minutes = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can divide the total time by 30 minutes to find the number of bottles he drinks: 225 minutes / 30 minutes = 7.5.

However, since you can't drink half a bottle, we'll round down to 7 bottles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into the problem.

To find the number of yellow balloons, we need to first find the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there were 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Since Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna, the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons is 18 / 3 = 6.

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a car maintenance expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total number of miles he drives in 30 days. Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, we can multiply the daily mileage by the number of days:

Total miles = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total miles = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total number of miles by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs:

Number of tune-ups = Total miles / 1000
Number of tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000
Number of tune-ups = 3

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a productivity expert. Let's break down Bruce's work schedule for the three days.

To calculate the total hours worked, we need to consider the hours worked each day. 

First, we know Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday. On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so it's 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours worked each day: 5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount they spent.

They bought a cake for $11 and 1 dozen balloons for $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, they bought 12 balloons. So, the cost of the balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.

The total amount spent so far is $11 (cake) + $6 (balloons) = $17.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $17 (cake and balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $31.

Since they started with the same amount of money, we can set up an equation: 
x + x = 31, where x is the amount of money each girl received.

Combine like terms: 2x = 31

Divide both sides by 2: x = 31 / 2
x = 15.5

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50.

The final answer is: $15.50"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a pet care expert. Let's break down the information given to determine the total number of pets Larry has.

First, we know Larry has 3 cats. Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, we can calculate the number of dogs as 3 * 3 = 9.

Next, we're told he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so the number of rabbits is 9 - 2 = 7.

Moving on to the fish tank, Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits, which gives us 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

Lastly, his gerbil collection is 1/3 the number of fish, so 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of each type together: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a food enthusiast and a math whiz. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

To determine how long the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person eats per day. Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is the sum of Abby's and Josh's slices: 2 + 4 = 6 slices per day.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total slices eaten per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a marine biologist with a passion for shell collecting. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is:

10 years - 5 years = 5 years
Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is:

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a tea connoisseur and expert in tea brewing. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we need to first determine the total number of cups of mint tea. Since Lana brews a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea, we can subtract this from the total number of cups: 27 - 15 = 12.

Now, we know that Lana divides the cups into 3 rows, and she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row. To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we can divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3: 12 ÷ 3 = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Hello there! I'm Yumi, a wildlife biologist specializing in sloth behavior and ecology. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to consider the time constraint of 8 hours and the time it takes for the sloth to make a round trip (4 hours). Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, we can calculate the number of berries he can pick per trip as follows:

Number of berries per trip = Total berries / Number of trips
= 24 berries / 2 trips
= 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the sloth can pick 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

The final answer is 12."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a water management specialist. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we first need to calculate the initial amount of water in the tank. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, we can calculate this as:

Initial water in the tank = (1/2) * 10000 gallons
= 5000 gallons

Next, we need to subtract the amount of water emptied from the tank each day. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so after 6 days, the amount of water remaining in the tank will be:

Remaining water in the tank = Initial water in the tank - (500 gallons/day * 6 days)
= 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons
= 2000 gallons

The final answer is: 2000"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a movie enthusiast and budget expert. Let's break down Colby's movie-going expenses to determine how many movies he can see.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. Now he has $134 - $10 = $124 left.

To find out how many movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since it's a Friday, the ticket costs $10.

$124 ÷ $10 = 12.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, he can see 12 movies.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a pastry expert with a passion for baking. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls x 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins x 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a gardening expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate the average number of Junebugs removed by Rita.

To find the average, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

Rita removed 39 Junebugs on Monday. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs. So, the total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156.

On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs, and on Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300

There are 5 days in total (Monday to Friday). To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days:

Average Junebugs removed per day = 300 / 5

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation expert with a focus on route optimization and travel time analysis. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. Using the formula Distance = Speed × Time, we can calculate the distance the bus traveled as:

Distance = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car, on the other hand, traveled at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. Using the same formula, we can calculate the distance the car traveled as:

Distance = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance traveled, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:

300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into solving the problem together.

We're given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages. Let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as P + 10, and Jean's age as J. We can write the equation for their combined age:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2P + J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2P + J = 90

Now, we know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's and Jean's ages, so we can write another equation:

P = (P + 10) + J

Simplifying this equation, we get:

P = P + J + 10

Subtract P from both sides:

0 = J + 10

Subtract 10 from both sides:

-J = 10

Multiply both sides by -1:

J = -10

Now that we have Jean's age, we can find Peter's age:

P + J = 90
P + (-10) = 90

Subtract -10 from both sides:

P = 100

So, Peter's age is 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into the problem.

To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so the total number of balloons is:
4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons
Adding Maria's 1 balloon, the total becomes:
8 balloons + 1 balloon = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons

To find the total number of balloons, we add the initial 9 balloons to the additional 15 balloons:
9 balloons + 15 balloons = 24 balloons

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a professional event planner with expertise in logistics and organization. I'd be happy to help you with your yard sale.

To determine the number of tables needed, we need to calculate the total number of boxes and then divide that by the number of boxes that can fit on each table.

First, let's calculate the total number of boxes: 10 people donated 5 boxes each, so that's 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. Adding the 10 boxes they already own, we get a total of 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since each table can hold 2 boxes, we can fit 60 / 2 = 30 boxes on 30 tables.

However, they already have 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we subtract the existing tables from the total needed: 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables to accommodate all the donated items.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a livestock nutritionist. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total amount of hay needed for Nate's animals.

To determine the total amount of hay required, we need to calculate the amount of hay each animal needs and then add them together.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Since there are 15 goats, the total amount of hay needed for goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, each sheep needs 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay. With 12 sheep, the total amount of hay needed for sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the hay required for goats and sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay in total.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down John's situation step by step.

First, we need to calculate John's total earnings. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:

50 * 6 = 300 dollars

Next, he spends 50 dollars on gas, leaving him with:

300 - 50 = 250 dollars

Then, he buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends a total of:

5 * 10 = 50 dollars

Now, we subtract the cost of the pencils from his remaining earnings:

250 - 50 = 200 dollars

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has:

200 - 100 = 100 dollars left

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the amount he has left by 25:

100 / 25 = 4

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down James' situation step by step.

James initially purchased 10 CDs at $15 each, resulting in a total cost of $150. Since he received a 40% discount, we can calculate the discount amount as follows:

Discount amount = Total cost of CDs * Discount percentage
Discount amount = $150 * 0.4
Discount amount = $60

After the discount, James had a total cost of $150 - $60 = $90.

However, James decided to sell 5 CDs for $40 each, which means he received a total of 5 * $40 = $200.

To determine how much James was out, we need to subtract the amount he received from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount:

Amount James was out = Total cost after discount - Total amount from selling CDs
Amount James was out = $90 - $200
Amount James was out = -$110

Since James was out $110, he actually lost $110.

First, let's calculate the total value of the yams: 6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9.

Next, we'll calculate the total value of the sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20.

Lastly, we'll calculate the total value of the carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5.

Now, let's add the total values of all the crops together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a swimming enthusiast and speed analyst. I'd be happy to help you with James' lake-crossing adventure.

To calculate the total time James takes to cross the lake, we need to break down his journey into segments.

First, let's calculate the time James spends swimming 60% of the distance at 2 miles per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 0.6 * 20 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

Next, James rests on an island for half the time he spent swimming. So, the rest time is:

Rest time = Swimming time
Rest time = 6 hours

After resting, James swims the remaining 40% of the distance at half the speed (1 mile per hour).

Distance = 20 miles * 0.4
Distance = 8 miles

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Now, let's calculate the total time James spends on the entire journey.

Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Swimming time
Total time = 6 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 20 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a bakery expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. To find Marcus's age, we can simply subtract 5 from Deanna's age.

Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus's age = 26 - 5
Marcus's age = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. To find Leo's age, we can multiply Marcus's age by 2.

Leo's age = 2 * Marcus's age
Leo's age = 2 * 21
Leo's age = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points. We also know that Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored.

Let's denote the number of points Dinar scored as x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points. And since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points.

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 10) + ((x + 10) - 20) = 45

Combine like terms: 3x + 0 = 45

Subtract 0 from both sides: 3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3: x = 15

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find out how many points Azibo scored:

Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points
= (15 + 10) - 20
= 25 - 20
= 5

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

The final answer is 5."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a bookbinding expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch. Since each paper is printed on both sides, the number of pages per inch is 2.

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:

Number of pages = Number of pages per inch * Thickness of the book
= 2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches
= 3 pages

Therefore, the book contains 3 pages."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a productivity expert. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total number of reports Vince stapled.

To determine the total number of reports, we need to calculate the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. There are 12 hours in 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and 11 hours in 12:00 PM to 11:00 PM. 

Total minutes = (12 hours * 60 minutes/hour) + (11 hours * 60 minutes/hour) 
Total minutes = 720 + 660 
Total minutes = 1380 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of reports.

Total reports = 1380 / 15 
Total reports = 92

The final answer is 92."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sleep specialist. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day.

To determine the total minutes Kim slept, we need to calculate the total minutes she slept and subtract the minutes she woke up early.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. 

8 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 480 minutes

However, she woke up 5 minutes early, so we subtract 5 minutes from the total minutes she slept:
480 - 5 = 475 minutes

Additionally, she woke up from 2:15 to 2:38 am, which is 23 minutes. We need to add these minutes to the total:
475 + 23 = 498 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{498}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a culinary expert with extensive experience in kitchen management and utensil organization. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Since he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons he has. Two dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

To find 2/3 of 24 cups, we can multiply 24 by 2 and then divide by 3:
(2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons initially. He gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so he is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons, so the total number of utensils he has remaining is:

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a healthcare consultant with expertise in hospital management and capacity planning. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to calculate the initial number of occupied beds and then subtract the number of patients admitted during that period.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 occupied. To find the initial number of occupied beds, we can calculate 1/5 of 1000:

1/5 × 1000 = 200 beds

Since 200 beds are occupied, the number of unoccupied beds is:
1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Next, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so:
2 weeks = 2 × 7 = 14 days

With 50 patients admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 14 days is:
50 × 14 = 700 patients

Now, we subtract the number of patients admitted from the initial number of unoccupied beds to find the final number of unoccupied beds:
800 - 700 = 100 beds

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a data analyst. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of non-work emails:

Total emails per day = 16
Work emails per day = 7
Non-work emails per day = Total emails per day - Work emails per day
Non-work emails per day = 16 - 7
Non-work emails per day = 9

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are to family. Since two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family, we can calculate this as:

Emails to family per day = (2/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to family per day = (2/3) * 9
Emails to family per day = 6

Now, we need to find out how many of the non-work emails are to her boyfriend. Since one-third of the non-work emails are to her boyfriend, we can calculate this as:

Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * 9
Emails to boyfriend per day = 3

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. We're given that Jason carried 2 balls. 

Since Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine Jeffrey's balls by dividing Jason's balls by 2:
Jeffrey's balls = Jason's balls / 2
Jeffrey's balls = 2 / 2
Jeffrey's balls = 1

Now, we know that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so we can calculate Jordan's balls by multiplying Jason's balls by 2:
Jordan's balls = 2 * Jason's balls
Jordan's balls = 2 * 2
Jordan's balls = 4

To find the total number of balls, we add the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
Total balls = Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls
Total balls = 4 + 2 + 1
Total balls = 7

"Hello there! I'm Yumi, a treasure hunter and expert in cartography and excavation techniques. I've been studying the island's topography and analyzing the pirate's digging patterns to determine the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.

Let's break down the information:

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 6 holes on the third day (after filling in 2 holes). To find the total number of holes by the end of the third day, I'll add these values:

10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, I'll multiply the total number of holes by 4:

4 × 29 = 116 holes

Now, to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, I'll subtract the total number of holes by the end of the third day from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:

116 - 29 = 87 holes

Therefore, the pirates dug 87 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The final answer is: 87"

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others. To find the number of corn chips Collins got, we can add 15 to the number of corn chips Amora and Lainey got.

Collins' corn chips = Amora's corn chips + 15
Collins' corn chips = 70 + 15
Collins' corn chips = 85

Now, we can find the total number of corn chips by adding the corn chips of all three:
Total corn chips = Amora's corn chips + Lainey's corn chips + Collins' corn chips
Total corn chips = 70 + 70 + 85
Total corn chips = 225

"As a Pokémon researcher, I've analyzed the situation to determine the number of Pokémon caught by Stan.

Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that:
1. The total number of Pokémon caught is 339: A + S + X = 339
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: X = S + 5
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the value of X from equation 2 into equation 1:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the value of S from equation 3 into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a television show enthusiast and expert in episode analysis. Let's dive into the world of television programming.

To determine the total time John will spend watching the show, we need to calculate the total number of episodes and then multiply it by the length of each episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can calculate the total time as follows:

Total minutes per episode = 20
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, we can multiply the total number of episodes by the total minutes per episode to find the total time John will spend watching the show:

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200

Therefore, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a wildlife biologist specializing in bird migration patterns. I'd be happy to help you calculate the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes.

To determine the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to consider the distances traveled in each direction. The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the first direction is:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 30 miles/hour × 10 hours
= 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the second direction is:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 18 miles/hour × 2 hours
= 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the third direction is:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 22 miles/hour × 5 hours
= 110 miles

Since the bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, the net distance traveled south is:

Net Distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
= 264 miles

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 264 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{264}$"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a landscape designer with expertise in calculating perimeter and area for garden fencing. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine the total number of wooden slats needed, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence, which can be calculated using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to find the total number of wooden slats needed:

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats for his 15-foot by 10-foot garden fence.

The final answer is: 100"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges, with each box containing 20 oranges. To find out how many oranges she had, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box:

12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

Next, she gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, for a total of 4 boxes given away. We calculate the number of oranges given away:

4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges

Now, Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the original 240 oranges:

1/4 * 240 oranges = 60 oranges

To find out how many oranges she had left, we subtract the oranges given away and the ones she kept from the initial total:

240 oranges - 80 oranges - 60 oranges = 100 oranges

Since she sold the rest, the number of oranges she sold is 100 oranges.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

We're given that Richard, Jerry, and Robert are sharing 60 cherries. We know Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to determine Richard's share first.

Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, we can set up an equation:

Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find Jerry's share by subtracting Robert's and Richard's cherries from the total:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Robert's cherries - Richard's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 30 - 20
Jerry's cherries = 10

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Emil is currently 19 years old. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means that his dad's age at that time will be twice Emil's age at that time. 

We can represent Emil's age as E and his dad's age as D. We can represent his brother's age as B. We know that E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so we can set up the equation: 24 = D/2.

To solve for D, we can multiply both sides by 2, which gives us D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so we can set up the equation: 24 = 2B.

To solve for B, we can divide both sides by 2, which gives us B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of their ages now. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12.

The sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a jewelry expert. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total number of beads Adrianne has.

To find the total number of beads, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend. 

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a seafood expert with extensive knowledge of crawfish. Let's break down Joe's crawfish catch:

To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day:

Thursday: 3 pounds
Friday: 4 times Thursday's amount = 4 * 3 = 12 pounds
Saturday: half of Friday's amount = 12 / 2 = 6 pounds

Total amount of crawfish caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:

21 / 3 = 7

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

The final answer is 7."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders/band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a shoe size expert. Let's calculate the average shoe size.

We know that Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's. Since Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

To find the average size of the two shoes, we add the sizes together and divide by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes is 15."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a landscape designer with expertise in garden planning and flower arrangement. I'd be happy to help you determine the cost of plants for your flower bed.

To calculate the number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to consider the total length of the bed in inches and the space required between each plant. The bed is 111 feet long, which is equivalent to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches. Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant, we can fit 1332 / 18 = 74 plants in the bed.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 74 - 17 = 57 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 57 * 6 = $342.

The final answer is: $342"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a nutrition expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to calculate his daily pretzel intake and then multiply it by 7.

Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, who eats 18 pretzels a day. To find Edgar's brother's daily pretzel intake, we can multiply Edgar's daily pretzel intake by 1/2.

18 pretzels * 1/2 = 9 pretzels

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply Edgar's brother's daily pretzel intake by 7 to find his weekly pretzel intake.

9 pretzels * 7 days = 63 pretzels

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a gardening expert with extensive experience in floral arrangements. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total cost of filling Katherine's hanging baskets.

To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias can be calculated as follows: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00.

The cost of sweet potato vines can be calculated as follows: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00.

Now, let's add the costs together: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a gardening expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many roses Artemis can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds

Next, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, we can subtract the total amount used from the total amount available:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate her monthly savings and then multiply it by 12.

Jessica's monthly income is $2,000, and she sets aside 25% of her income for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000, we can multiply:

$2,000 * 0.25 = $500

Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000, we can calculate how many pairs she can afford to buy in a month:

$500 (monthly savings) ÷ $1,000 (pair price) = 0.5 pairs per month

Now, let's calculate how many pairs she can buy in a year:

0.5 pairs/month * 12 months = 6 pairs per year

The final answer is: 6"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a culinary expert with extensive experience in seafood preparation. Let's break down the task at hand.

To determine the time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time for each step separately.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can use the formula:

Time = Total Shrimp / Shrimp per Minute
Time = 90 / 6
Time = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. We know that Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we can use the formula:

Time = Total Shrimp / Shrimp per Batch
Time = 90 / 30
Time = 3 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and cook the shrimp to get the total time:

Total Time = Time to Peel + Time to Cook
Total Time = 15 + 3
Total Time = 18 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 18 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

Final answer: 18"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a climate control specialist. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is, let's break down the cooling and warming effects.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room 2 degrees per hour. So, the room was cooled 3 x 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room 3 degrees per hour. So, the room was cooled an additional 4 x 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

The room will warm up at 2 degrees per hour with no air conditioner running. Since the air conditioner was off for 2 hours, the room warmed up 2 x 2 = 4 degrees.

The final temperature is the starting temperature minus the total cooling effect plus the warming effect: Final temperature = Starting temperature - 18 + 4 = Starting temperature - 14.

Since we don't know the starting temperature, we can represent the final temperature as a difference from the starting temperature. Let's call the starting temperature 'x'. Then, the final temperature is x - 14.

The question asks how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is. Since the final temperature is x - 14, it is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a space enthusiast and astronomer. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step:

We know that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time. Let's denote the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as x.

Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can set up the equation: Bill's age = 3 * (30 + x). We also know that Bill's age is 90 years old when he saw the comet. So, we can set up the equation: 90 = 3 * (30 + x).

Now, let's solve for x:
90 = 3 * (30 + x)
90 = 90 + 3x
3x = 0
x = 0

Since x = 0, it means that Bill's dad saw the comet 0 years after Bill saw it. This is not possible, so let's re-examine the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the equation: Bill's age = 3 * (30 + x). We know that Bill's age is 90 years old when he saw the comet. So, we can set up the equation: 90 = 3 * (30 + x).

Now, let's solve for x:
90 = 3 * (30 + x)
90 = 90 + 3x
3x = 0
x = 0

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating Buford's check-writing frequency.

To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider the frequency of each type of check he writes. 

First, let's calculate the total number of checks for the bills he pays monthly: 1 (electric bill) + 1 (gas bill) = 2 checks per month.

Next, we need to account for the checks he writes to the church. Since he writes 2 checks per month, and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of checks for the church is 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks/year.

Lastly, Buford writes 4 checks per year to the pest and lawn service, as there are 4 quarters in a year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks: 2 (electric and gas bills) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 30 checks per year.

The final answer is: 30"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation expert with extensive knowledge of flight schedules and routes. Let's break down the information provided to determine the number of flights the first plane makes to France in one day.

We know that the first plane makes 88 trips in total. Since 3/4 of these flights are to Greece, we can calculate the number of flights to Greece as follows:

3/4 * 88 = 66 flights to Greece

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. To find the number of flights to France, we subtract the flights to Greece from the total number of flights:

88 - 66 = 22 flights

Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, we divide the result by 2:

22 / 2 = 11 flights to France

Therefore, the first plane makes 11 flights to France in one day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a forest ecologist. I've studied the behavior of wolves in the forest, and I'm happy to help you with this problem.

To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

We know that the total age of the children is 20, and we have the ages of Akbar (A = 3) and Alessandro (S = 4). We're also given that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age is calculated by dividing the total age by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

Since Helene's age is twice the average age, we can calculate her age as 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age: W = 20 - 3 - 4 - 10.

Let's calculate Wilfred's age: W = 20 - 3 - 4 - 10 = 3.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Walter initially collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from an online fund, totaling $2000. His lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. To find the amount the lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate three times the total amount collected so far.

Total amount collected = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Lawyer's contribution = 3 * $2000 = $6000

However, Walter's friend is going to give him $200, which will be subtracted from the total amount collected. This means the final amount Walter's lawyer will contribute is $6000 - $200 = $5800.

The final answer is: $5800"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a pastry chef and cookie connoisseur. I'd be delighted to help you with this sweet problem.

To determine the number of people in the church, we need to calculate the total number of cookies given away and then divide that by the number of cookies each person received.

First, let's calculate the total number of cookies given to the church: 1/2 of 1500 cookies is 750 cookies.

Now, we'll divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received: 750 cookies ÷ 15 cookies per person = 50 people.

The final answer is 50."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a food scientist specializing in fruit distribution and portion control. Today, I'll be happy to help you with dividing a watermelon among a family of 6.

To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to consider the ratio of adult to child portions. Let's assume the number of slices for the kids is x. Since each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, the number of slices for the adults is 2x.

We know the total number of slices is 6, so we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 6

Combine like terms: 3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2

Now that we know x, we can find the number of slices for the adults: 2x = 2 * 2 = 4

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we'll divide the number of slices for the adults (4) by the total number of slices (6) and multiply by 100:

(4/6) * 100 = 66.67%

So, each adult gets approximately 66.67% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{66.67\%}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a medical scheduling expert. Let's break down the time Doctor Jones has available to update his records.

To determine the time left for record-keeping, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments. 

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Converting the total time to hours: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a professional baker and cake decorator. I'd be happy to help you determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake.

To calculate the total time required to make the cake, we need to add up the time it takes for each step:

- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time to find the latest start time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan can start making the cake at 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: 2:00 pm"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold. We know that Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 

Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together, we can divide 64 by the total number of boxes to find the number of chocolate bars in a box.

Number of chocolate bars in a box = 64 ÷ 8

To avoid any potential division errors, let's use a fraction to represent the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter.

Let x be the number of chocolate bars in a box. Then, we can set up the equation:

3.5x + 4.5x = 64

Combine like terms:

7x = 64

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 64 ÷ 7

x = 9.14 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a chocolate bar, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 8 boxes would result in 64 chocolate bars, so the number of chocolate bars in a box is exactly 8.

Final answer: 8"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a dance instructor with 5 years of experience in managing dance studios. I'd be happy to help you calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio.

To determine the expected earnings, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25 per session, and the studio is rented 3 days a week. So, the cost of renting the studio per week is $25 * 3 = $75. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students. So, the cost of students' lessons per week is $1.50 * 3 * 10 = $45. In a month, the cost of students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total cost of renting the studio and students' lessons per month is $300 (renting) + $180 (students' lessons) = $480.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into the problem.

To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 ÷ 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 ÷ 7 = 8.

To find the difference, subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a wildlife biologist specializing in mammalian populations. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total population of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to calculate the number of new porcupines born and add it to the initial population.

First, let's find the number of female porcupines: 3/5 of the total population is 3/5 * 50 = 30.

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines:
50 (initial population) + 1440 (new porcupines) = 1490

Final answer: 1490"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a pool expert with extensive experience in calculating pool volumes and costs. To determine the cost of filling the Smith family's pool, we'll need to calculate the volume of the pool first.

The pool's dimensions are given as 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. To find the volume, we'll multiply these dimensions:

Volume = Length x Width x Depth
Volume = 14 x 25 x 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll do that next:

Total gallons = Volume x 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 x 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Total gallons x Cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 x 0.10
Cost = $826

The cost to fill the pool is $826."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a stick enthusiast and expert in stick-related calculations. Let's dive into the problem.

We have 9 red sticks, and there are 5 more blue sticks than red. To find the number of blue sticks, we simply add 5 to the number of red sticks:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
= 9 + 5
= 14

Now, we know there are 14 blue sticks. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so we subtract 3 from the number of blue sticks:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
= 14 - 3
= 11

To find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
= 9 + 14 + 11
= 34

The final answer is 34."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours
Distance = 220 miles

Similarly, to find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply her speed by the time she traveled: 

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours
Distance = 450 miles

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find the difference:
Distance = 450 miles - 220 miles
Distance = 230 miles

The difference in distance traveled is 230 miles."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a high school counselor. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School, let's break down the information given:

- Total students: 3000
- Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500
- One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16
- Remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500
- One-half of the students under 16 are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16

Now, let's find the number of female students over 16 and under 16:
- Female students over 16: 1500 - 375 = 1125
- Female students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sports enthusiast and track enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to calculate the difference between their lap counts. 

First, let's determine the number of laps each person can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, let's find the difference between Bethany's and Quinn's lap counts: 10 - 5 = 5.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a water management specialist. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To determine the remaining amount of water in the tank, let's break down the water pumped each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining amount of water is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a power bank expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:

x - (9% * 5) = x - 0.45x = 0.55x

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:

0.55x - (7% * 3) = 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x

Since the charge remaining is 28%, we can set up an equation:

0.34x = 0.28

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 0.34:

x = 0.28 / 0.34
x = 0.82

To convert this to a percentage, we can multiply by 100:

x = 0.82 * 100
x = 82%

The final answer is: 82"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to find 20% of the cost of the car. 

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours/week = 2 weeks

Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a nutrition expert specializing in fruit analysis. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits and subtract that from his initial $10.

He bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He bought 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total amount spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25, we need to re-evaluate the calculation. It seems there's an error in the initial assessment. Let's correct that.

Corrected total amount spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

However, Jamaar can only spend $10, so we need to subtract the correct total from his initial amount.

Corrected total amount spent on other fruits = $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25

Since Jamaar can't spend a negative amount, we need to re-calculate the total amount spent on other fruits.

Corrected total amount spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Let's re-evaluate the calculation: $1.5 + $3 = $4.5, $4.5 + $2 = $6.5, and $6.5 + $3.75 = $10.25. Jamaar actually spent $10.25, which is more than his initial $10. This means he can't buy any plums.

Each pack has 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces given away is 13 * 60 = 780.

Since the sweets were given to 10 friends equally, we divide the total number of pieces given away by 10:

780 ÷ 10 = 78

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a grocery store analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the price of carrots after three years.

To calculate the price increase, we can use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the final price, P is the initial price, r is the annual increase rate (as a decimal), and n is the number of years.

In this case, the initial price (P) is $120, the annual increase rate (r) is 5% or 0.05, and the number of years (n) is 3.

A = 120(1 + 0.05)^3
A = 120(1.05)^3
A = 120(1.157625)
A = 139.25

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the number of selfies.

3 x 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the number of portraits.

2 x 9 = 18

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a statistics expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of easy questions. Since 40% of the questions are easy, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of easy questions = Total questions * Percentage of easy questions
= 60 * 0.4
= 24

Next, we know that the remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult. So, we subtract the number of easy questions from the total to find the number of average and difficult questions:

Number of average and difficult questions = Total questions - Number of easy questions
= 60 - 24
= 36

Since these questions are divided equally, we divide the result by 2:

Number of average questions = Number of average and difficult questions / 2
= 36 / 2
= 18

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is:

Number of easy questions Aries is sure to get = Number of easy questions * Percentage of easy questions Aries is sure to get
= 24 * 0.75
= 18

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is:

Number of average and difficult questions Aries is sure to get = Number of average and difficult questions * Percentage of average and difficult questions Aries is sure to get
= 18 * 0.5
= 9

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we add the points from easy and average/difficult questions:

Total points Aries is sure to get = Number of easy questions Aries is sure to get + Number of average and difficult questions Aries is sure to get
= 18 + 9
= 27

The final answer is 27."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into solving the problem step by step.

To find out how many small stuffed animals Teresa sold, we need to first determine the price of a large stuffed animal and the total revenue from the sales.

Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, and each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as 's' and the number of small stuffed animals sold as '2s'. The total revenue from the sales is $120. We can set up the equation: 12s + 4(2s) = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12s + 8s = 120
Combining like terms, we get: 20s = 120
Dividing both sides by 20, we get: s = 6

Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2s = 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

"Greetings! I'm Yumi, a skilled mining engineer. I've analyzed the given information to determine the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month.

To calculate the total amount of ore mined, we need to consider the increased efficiency of the steel pickaxe. As we know, one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, the dwarf's efficiency doubles to 24 pounds per day. Then, with a steel pickaxe, the efficiency increases by 50% of the iron pickaxe's efficiency, which is 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Since there are 40 dwarves, the total amount of ore mined per day with steel pickaxes is 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

To find the total amount of ore mined in a month, we multiply this by 30 days: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a food enthusiast and price analysis expert. I'd be happy to help you determine the price of the package with 8 sandwiches.

To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to analyze the given information. The prices of the first two packages are $3 for 2 sandwiches and $6 for 4 sandwiches. Since the prices are proportional, we can set up a proportion to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches.

Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as x. We can set up the proportion as follows:

(3 sandwiches / $3) = (8 sandwiches / x)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3x = 8 * 3
3x = 24

Now, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $8.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 x $2000
Monthly payment = $200

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

The final answer is: $200"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons at each stage.

First, we calculate the number of red balloons that burst:
40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.

Now, we calculate the number of red balloons remaining:
25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, we calculate the number of yellow balloons released:
Half of 12 yellow balloons = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released.

Then, we calculate the number of yellow balloons remaining:
12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

We also need to find the number of blue balloons added:
75% of 8 blue balloons = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.

Finally, we calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school:
15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 27 balloons.

The final answer is 27."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a probability expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 40% chance of getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

Now, we add up the probabilities of these scenarios: 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.8

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.8 * 100 = 80%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 80%.

Final answer: $\boxed{80\%}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a student at Apple High School. I'm excited to help you with the graduation ticket distribution problem.

To determine how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of seats taken by graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Let's calculate the total seats taken:
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 ÷ 950 = 5

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final answer is: 5"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first determine the number of medium beans he can eat. Since it takes 75 large beans to fill him up and he can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, we can calculate the number of medium beans as follows:

Medium beans = 2 * Large beans
Medium beans = 2 * 75
Medium beans = 150

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. To find the number of small beans, we can divide the number of medium beans by 3:

Small beans = Medium beans / 3
Small beans = 150 / 3
Small beans = 50

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

The final answer is 50."
"As a financial analyst, I'd be happy to help you calculate Melissa's hourly wage after expenses.

To determine her total daily income after expenses, we need to subtract her parking expenses from her daily income. 

Daily income: $15 per day
Parking expenses: $3 per day
Total daily income after expenses: $15 - $3 = $12 per day

Since Melissa works for 3 days, her total income after expenses is $12 per day * 3 days = $36.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a physics enthusiast and expert in fluid dynamics. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we can divide the width of the driveway by 3:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, the total time it will take him to set off all the soda fountains is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

35"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's solve the problem step by step.

To find the total number of packs, we need to multiply the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes.

Number of apples in one box = 40
Number of boxes = 2

Total number of apples = 40 * 2 = 80

Since each pack has 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs.

Number of packs = 80 ÷ 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

Final answer: 10"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a food enthusiast and a cheese aficionado. I'd be happy to help you with calculating Amor's remaining budget.

To determine how much money Amor will have left to buy meat, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she purchased. 

The cost of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she bought 2 pounds, so the total cost of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22. 

The cost of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds, so the total cost of Mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost of cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

The final answer is: $10"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the total amount of money lost from not working while in school, we need to multiply the number of years in school by the annual income.

Number of years in school: 4 years
Annual income before college: $25,000
Annual income after college: $75,000 (triple the original income)

Total amount lost from not working: 4 years * $25,000 = $100,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost from not working:

Total amount of loans: 4 years * $50,000 = $200,000
Total amount to earn: $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new annual income:

$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sewing expert with extensive experience in creating custom comforters. When it comes to calculating fabric requirements, I always follow a straightforward approach.

To determine the total amount of fabric needed for Jim's king-sized comforter, we need to calculate the area of the comforter. Since the comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of the comforter will be:
- Length: 6 + 2 = 8 feet
- Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of the comforter:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 8 x 10
Area = 80 square feet

Since the comforter is made of two pieces, we need to multiply the area by 2:
Total fabric needed = 2 x 80
Total fabric needed = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs 160 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a postal analyst. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery:
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85
17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery:
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204
5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have three people dividing an amount of $1920. The second person took $80 more than the first person, and the third person took twice what the second person took. To find the share of the first person, we can use algebra.

Let's denote the amount the first person took as x. Then, the second person took x + 80, and the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 1760/3

x = 586.67

So, the first person took $586.67.

The final answer is: $586.67"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a professional painter with extensive experience in managing large-scale painting projects. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total hours worked by each painter, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since the team worked 3/8 of a day every day for 3 weeks, we can calculate the total hours worked as follows:

Total days worked = 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days
Total hours worked = 21 days * 3/8 days/hour = 7.875 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we can divide the total hours worked by the number of painters to find the hours worked per painter:

Hours worked per painter = Total hours worked / Number of painters
= 7.875 hours / 4
= 1.96875 hours

To convert this to a more readable format, we can round to two decimal places:

Hours worked per painter ≈ 1.97 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.97}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sports enthusiast and math whiz. I'm here to help you solve the tennis ball retrieval problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total. We can represent the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. Since he retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final answer is: 10"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst with expertise in depreciation calculations. I'd be happy to help you with finding the price of the car in 2008.

To calculate the price of the car in 2008, we need to apply the depreciation rate of 21% to the initial price of $20,000.

Price in 2008 = Initial Price - (Initial Price x Depreciation Rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 x 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Now, let's calculate the price of the car in 2009.

Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 x Depreciation Rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 x 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,306.80
= $12,493.20

Finally, let's calculate the price of the car in 2010.

Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - (Price in 2009 x Depreciation Rate)
= $12,493.20 - ($12,493.20 x 0.21)
= $12,493.20 - $2,616.928
= $9,876.272

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,876.27.

The final answer is $9,876.27."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a laundry expert with extensive experience in managing household laundry. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine the total number of loads, we need to calculate the number of loads for each type of bed and then add them together.

For twin beds, we have 4 beds * 52 weeks = 208 twin loads. Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, we divide the total number of twin loads by 3 to find the number of loads per week: 208 / 3 = 69.33 (round up to 70 since you can't do a fraction of a load).

For king beds, we have 1 bed * 52 weeks = 52 king loads. Since the laundry machine can wash 1 king set at a time, we divide the total number of king loads by 1 to find the number of loads per week: 52 / 1 = 52.

Now, we add the total loads per week for twin and king beds: 70 + 52 = 122 loads per week.

To find the total number of loads per year, we multiply the total loads per week by 52 weeks: 122 * 52 = 6334 loads.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared 4 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. To find the total number of slices, we can multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:

Total slices = Number of pizzas * Slices per pizza
Total slices = 4 * 8
Total slices = 32

Now, let's focus on the information about Becky's and Jake's eating habits. We know that Becky ate 10 slices, and she ate 3 more slices than Jake. We can set up an equation to find out how many slices Jake ate:

Becky's slices = Jake's slices + 3
10 = Jake's slices + 3

To solve for Jake's slices, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Now that we know Jake's slices, we can find Silvia's slices. Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can multiply Jake's slices by 2:

Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now that we know how many slices each person ate, we can find the total number of slices they ate:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a culinary expert with a passion for efficient cooking techniques. Let's dive into solving the problem at hand.

To determine the length of Betsy's part, we can use the concept of time and algebra. We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, and the total time taken to make the meal was 98 minutes. Let's denote Donovan's part as x. Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Now that we know Donovan's part is 40 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18:

Betsy's part = x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58

The final answer is 58."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a medical billing specialist. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit.

To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a productivity expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to calculate the number of emails that require a response first. 

James receives 80 emails per day, and 20% of those don't require a response. To find 20% of 80, we can multiply 80 by 0.2.

80 * 0.2 = 16 emails that don't require a response.

The number of emails that require a response is 80 - 16 = 64.

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, we can multiply this by 5 to find the total number of emails he responds to in a 5-day work week.

64 * 5 = 320

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is 14."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a logistics expert with extensive experience in managing mail operations. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total postage cost for Anthony's pizza parlor.

To determine the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first. Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = $7.00.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = $21.00.

The total cost of postage is $7.00 + $21.00 = $28.00.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a food enthusiast and expert in culinary calculations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we need to consider the initial number of sandwiches, the number eaten, and the additional ones ordered.

Initially, Sidney ordered 7 sub sandwiches. Mark ate 4 of them, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches. Then, Sidney ordered 3 more, bringing the total to 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a logistics expert with extensive experience in supply chain management. I'll be happy to help you with your question.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

We know that Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks dispatched for delivery, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Two hours after the trucks departed, it was reported that a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures and couldn't deliver the fertiliser.

To find the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we need to calculate the number of trucks that delivered and multiply it by the amount each truck carried.

First, let's find the number of trucks that delivered:
Total trucks dispatched = 20
Trucks that couldn't deliver = 1/4 * 20 = 5
Trucks that delivered = 20 - 5 = 15

Now, we can calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered:
Trucks that delivered * Tons per truck = 15 * 20 = 300 tons

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"Bonjour! As a pastry chef and butter connoisseur, I'd be delighted to help you with your query.

To determine the total cost of the butter, we need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs and then apply the discount.

Dennis requires 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen. So, he needs 6 x 1 = 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds.

To find the total cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) into groups of 2 pounds.

6 pounds / 2 pounds per group = 3 groups

Since each group costs 1.5 pounds, the total cost will be:
3 groups x 1.5 pounds per group = 4.5 pounds

Since the butter costs $4.00 a pound, the total cost will be:
4.5 pounds x $4.00 per pound = $18.00

The final answer is: $18.00"
"Happy birthday to Kayla! As a party planning expert, I'd be delighted to help calculate the total cost for her celebration.

To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, but 4 people said they couldn't come.

Total number of guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) - 4 (declined guests) = 41

Since the theater rental fee is $125 for a party of 20, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests. There are 21 additional guests (41 - 20).

Cost for additional guests = 21 * $6 = $126

Now, let's add the rental fee and the cost for the additional guests to find the total cost.

Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. To find the amount she spent, we can multiply 60 by 1/4.

1/4 * 60 = 15

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60.

1/3 * 60 = 20

The total amount of money they spent is 15 + 20 = 35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

$120 - $35 = $85

Therefore, Maggie and Riza have $85 left.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a primatology expert. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of bananas by 7 to find out how many bananas each monkey eats per day.

First, let's find out how many bananas the first monkey eats per day. We know that the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Now, let's find out how many bananas the first two monkeys eat in a day:
10 bananas (first monkey) + 14 bananas (second monkey) = 24 bananas

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is:
24 bananas/day * 7 days = 168 bananas

Now, let's find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a week:
315 bananas (total) - 168 bananas (first two monkeys) = 147 bananas

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we can divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7:
147 bananas / 7 days = 21 bananas per day

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a florist with extensive experience in managing flower arrangements and pricing. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the cost of the roses, let's first determine the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, we can calculate the cost of 15 roses as follows:

15 roses = 1.25 dozen
1.25 dozen * $15 per dozen = $18.75

Since Jenny has $25, we need to subtract the cost of the roses from the amount of money she has:

$25 - $18.75 = $6.25

Now, let's calculate the number of quarters Jenny will receive as change. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we can divide the change by the value of a quarter:

$6.25 ÷ $0.25 = 25 quarters

So, Jenny will leave with 25 quarters as change.

The final answer is: 25"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation expert with extensive knowledge of train schedules and waiting times. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time between each train's arrival and departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time between the first train's arrival and departure is 20 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the time between the second train's arrival and departure is 5 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes after the second train's arrival. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so the time between the third train's arrival and departure is 0 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 20 minutes after the third train's arrival. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:

Total waiting time = Waiting for the first train + Waiting for the second train + Waiting for the third train + Waiting for the fourth train
= 20 + 30 + 60 + 20
= 130 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{130}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12).

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend.

To find the original price, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so the sale price is 0.75 * original price = 2000. 

To find the original price, we divide 2000 by 0.75, which is 2666.67.

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * 2666.67 = 3200.

The original price was 2666.67, and the sale price was 3200. The discount is 3200 - 2666.67 = 533.33.

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100: (533.33 / 2666.67) * 100 = 20%.

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 20%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a marine biologist specializing in jellyfish behavior and ecology. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs working at the same rate, we need to consider the rate of jellyfish creation per hour. Since a new jellyfish is created every second, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate of jellyfish creation per hour = 1 jellyfish/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 jellyfish/hour

Now, if 5 springs are working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created per hour is:

Total rate = 5 * 3600 jellyfish/hour = 18,000 jellyfish/hour

To find the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours, we multiply the total rate by the number of hours:

Total jellyfish created in 4 hours = 18,000 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours = 72,000 jellyfish

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72,000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation engineer. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the time it took him to walk to the store and then back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took him to walk to the store. Since he walked halfway, that's 2 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 0.5 hours

Since he walked back home, the total distance is 2 miles (to the store) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

The total time it took James to reach the store is 0.5 hours (to the store) + 1 hour (back home) = 1.5 hours.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a cost analysis expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas individually and compare it to the cost of buying 10 bunches.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches individually:
10 bunches * $0.80 per bunch = $8.00

Next, we'll calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches:
10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00

Now, let's find the difference in cost:
$30.00 - $8.00 = $22.00

Since Jenny spent more money by buying in bunches, we can say she saved $22.00 by buying individually.

The final answer is: $22.00"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a landscape designer with expertise in fence planning and measurement. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we need to determine the amount each person gets and then subtract that from the total length of the fence.

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

Therefore, the amount of fence left over for Sam is 80 feet.

The final answer is: 80"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a herpetologist specializing in crocodile behavior and growth patterns. When analyzing the growth rate of a crocodile, it's essential to consider the species' natural growth patterns and environmental factors.

To determine the total growth in 13 years, we can use the formula:

Total growth = Growth rate per year * Number of years

Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can calculate the growth rate per year as follows:

Growth rate per year = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches/year

Now, let's apply this growth rate to the total number of years:

Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years

Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

The final answer is: 26"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a bike enthusiast and expert in bicycle sales analysis. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To calculate Marcel's total earnings, we need to determine the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold:
Number of Trekking bikes = Total bikes * 0.5
= 300 * 0.5
= 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold:
Number of BMX bikes = Total bikes * 0.15
= 300 * 0.15
= 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold:
Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - (Number of Trekking bikes + Number of BMX bikes)
= 300 - (150 + 45)
= 300 - 195
= 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes * Price of Trekking bike
= 150 * $450
= $67,500

Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes * Price of BMX bike
= 45 * $250
= $11,250

Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes * Price of MTB bike
= 105 * $500
= $52,500

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
= $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500
= $131,250

"As a farm management specialist, I've analyzed the situation to determine the number of bales of hay left in the field.

The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales per hour. To find the net change in bales per hour, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 5 - 3 = 2 bales per hour.

Since the farmer and the truck driver work for 6 hours, we multiply the net change per hour by the number of hours worked: 2 bales/hour * 6 hours = 12 bales.

Therefore, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

12"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a student with a passion for learning. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total hours John spends learning per week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, let's calculate the total minutes John spends in class per week. He attends 5 classes per day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes he spends in class per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Next, we need to add the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days. 

1/16 of 1000 minutes is 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

So, the total minutes he spends on learning per week is 1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60. 

1062.5 / 60 = 17.6875 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17.6875}$"

"Hello there! I'm Yumi, a paleontologist specializing in Mesozoic-era dinosaurs. I'm excited to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, which is half of what was left after the Tyrannosaurus rex ate. To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards.

Let's denote the amount left after the Tyrannosaurus rex ate as 'x'. Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left, they ate x/2 kilograms. We know that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so we can set up the equation: x/2 = 270.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 540.

Now, we know that the Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the initial amount, so the Tyrannosaurus rex ate 540/2 = 270 kilograms.

To find the initial amount, we add the amount the Tyrannosaurus rex ate to the amount left after the Tyrannosaurus rex ate: 270 + 270 = 540.

Therefore, there were 540 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the Tyrannosaurus rex ate.

Final answer: 540"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a professional painter with over 10 years of experience in residential painting projects. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total area to be painted, we need to find the area of each wall and add them together. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a probability expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas, 3 of which were shaken. She took 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas. Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 5 unshaken sodas. The friend can choose from 7 sodas.

To find the probability of the friend getting a shaken can, we divide the number of shaken cans by the total number of cans:

P(shaken can) = Number of shaken cans / Total number of cans
= 2/7

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

P(shaken can) = (2/7) * 100
= 28.57%

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 28.57%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28.57\%}$"
"As a transportation engineer, I can provide a straightforward solution to this problem.

When two trains travel in opposite directions, the distance between them increases at a rate equal to the sum of their speeds. Let's denote the speed of the first train as v1 and the speed of the second train as v2. We are given that v1 = 60 miles per hour and v2 = 30 miles per hour.

To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we can use the formula:

Distance = (v1 + v2) * time

Plugging in the values, we get:

Distance = (60 + 30) * 3
Distance = 90 * 3
Distance = 270 miles

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a tax expert with extensive experience in helping individuals and businesses with their tax needs. I'd be happy to assist you with calculating the number of people Billy can help.

To determine the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to work and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since you can't take a fraction of a day off, we'll round down to 6 days.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help (25) by the number of people he can help per day (6):

25 * 6 = 150

Therefore, Billy can help 150 people.

We know that Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old. To find Martha's age, we can simply subtract 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now, we know Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. To find Jeff's age, we can add 10 to Martha's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

The final answer is 30."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a waterpark enthusiast and thrill-seeker. I'm excited to help you with your question.

To calculate the time it takes to ride each waterslide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed. Let's do the math:

For the biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes
For the second biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest waterslide.

Final answer: 2"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a time management specialist. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks.

To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this amount of time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5:
1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sports enthusiast and a math whiz. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of 52 miles. Amber ran 8 miles. To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5.

Micah's distance = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We already know that Amber and Micah ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles together.

To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance run by all three.

Ahito's distance = 52 - 36 = 16 miles.

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the new balance on Sheila's credit card.

To find the new balance, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. She returned one item that cost $15.00. The new balance will be:

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To calculate the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:

$20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00

The price after the discount is:

$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. To calculate the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:

$30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00

The price after the discount is:

$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:

$16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

The new balance will be:

$70.00 (new balance after return) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Hello there! I'm Yumi, a marine biologist specializing in jellyfish behavior and ecology. I'm excited to help you solve this problem.

Let's dive into the world of jellyfish and unravel the mystery of the tank.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of those large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.

To find the total number of jellyfish in the tank, we can set up an equation. Let's represent the total number of jellyfish as x.

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of those large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that the number of large jellyfish that changed color is 6. We can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

Final answer: 90"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We're given that Chris is 4 years old. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now, Caroline is three times older than Ben. To find Caroline's age, we can multiply Ben's age by 3:

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we need to calculate her annual savings and annual expenses.

Lauren's current salary is $100,000. She saves 20% of her income, which is $20,000 per year. However, she plans to live on 40% of her current salary, which is $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. This is a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. Let's assume the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income, not 20% of her expenses.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a textile expert with a focus on ribbon and fabric management. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4), and then divide the result by the number of equal parts each part will be divided into (5).

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

(100 cm / 4) / 5

To solve this, we'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 100 cm by 4: 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm
2. Divide 25 cm by 5: 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

The final answer is: 5"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a student at the school. I'm happy to help you with your question.

To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the information that 40% of the students are boys, and there are 240 boys. Let's set up a proportion to solve for the total number of students.

Let x be the total number of students. We know that 40% of x is equal to 240. We can write this as an equation:

0.4x = 240

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

The final answer is: 360"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fashion expert with a keen eye for detail. When it comes to calculating the average height of heels, I always consider the total sum of heights and the total number of heels.

To find the average height, we need to add the total height of all the heels and divide by the total number of heels. In this case, we have:

Total height of 4-inch heels: 3 x 4 = 12 inches
Total height of 2-inch heels: 3 x 2 = 6 inches
Total height of all heels: 12 + 6 = 18 inches

Total number of heels: 3 + 3 = 6

Average height of heels: 18 / 6 = 3 inches

Therefore, the average height of heels at the party is 3 inches.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a hiking enthusiast and outdoor expert. I'd be happy to help you with Soledad's hiking plans.

To determine how many more miles Soledad needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time, we need to calculate her daily mileage goal. Since she wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can divide the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles ÷ 30 days = 310 miles per day

However, Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day, we subtract her current daily goal from the required daily amount:

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final answer: 185"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fruit expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much each person gets, we need to calculate the amount each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Since the question asks about the remaining amount, we'll subtract the total amount Pierre and Paul have from the initial 12 kg.

The total amount Pierre and Paul have is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

The remaining amount of apples is 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.
He spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

Raymond has $8 left.

The final answer is: $8"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a librarian with expertise in budgeting and financial management. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, leaving her with $16 - $4 = $12. She then spent $2 on the books, so she had $12 - $2 = $10 left. However, we know she has $2 left, which means the $10 must be the cost of the 2 books.

Since both books cost the same amount, we can divide $10 by 2 to find the cost of each book: $10 ÷ 2 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a calligraphy instructor with over 10 years of experience. I'd be happy to help you with the enrollment calculation.

To calculate the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year, we need to find 20% of the number of students last year and add it to the number of students last year.

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

Number of students last year = 50
Number of students this year = 50 + 10 = 60

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a lighthouse engineer. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we need to calculate the time it takes for the light to blink once and then multiply it by the total number of blinks.

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the time it takes for the light to blink once, we can divide 5 minutes by 255 blinks.

Time per blink = 5 minutes / 255 blinks = 0.0198 minutes per blink

Now, we can multiply the time per blink by the total number of blinks to find the total time.

Total time = 0.0198 minutes per blink * 459 blinks = 9.05 minutes

So, it will take the light approximately 9.05 minutes to blink 459 times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9.05}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fish enthusiast and aquarium expert. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break down the initial number of fish in Tate's garden pond:

- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

Tate buys 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes. We need to update the counts:

- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the difference between the total number of female fish and male fish:

Total female fish: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfish) = 16
Total male fish: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfish) = 11

The difference between the total number of female fish and male fish is: 16 - 11 = 5

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a household management expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total time, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their chores.

Amalia's time to mow the lawn is given as 4 hours.

Megan's time to walk the dog is 2 hours longer than Amalia's, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours.

Dior's time to do laundry is over 4 hours longer than Amalia's, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the time each person took to complete their chores:
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation expert with a focus on route optimization and distance calculations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the total distance driven in a month, we need to consider the round trip distance. The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, the total distance is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{560}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a walking enthusiast and fitness expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we need to first find out how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie walks 10 miles every day, we can multiply the number of days by the daily distance:

Distance = Number of days × Daily distance
= 7 days × 10 miles/day
= 70 miles

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can divide the distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian walks:

Brian's distance = Sofie's distance ÷ 2
= 70 miles ÷ 2
= 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a production management specialist with expertise in optimizing manufacturing processes. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine the production rate of the fifth worker, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then find the difference between the total number of toys needed and the number produced by the first four workers.

The first four workers consist of two workers producing 6 toys per hour and two workers producing 4 toys per hour. Since they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers is:

(2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours) + (2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours)
= 120 + 80
= 200 toys

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Now, we can find the number of toys produced by the fifth worker by subtracting the total number of toys produced by the first four workers from the total number of toys needed:

220 (total toys needed) - 200 (toys produced by first four workers) = 20 toys

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:

20 toys / 10 hours
= 2 toys/hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a canine nutrition expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of both dogs: 
15 + 30 = 45 pounds

So, Elijah and Kory's dogs weigh 45 pounds altogether.

The final answer is: 45"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sticker enthusiast and expert in sticker distribution dynamics. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many stickers Seth had initially, we need to work backwards. We know that Kris had 16 stickers after receiving 7 from Rob and keeping 9. This means Kris initially had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers.

Since Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris, and Kris had 23 stickers, Luis must have had 23 + 7 = 30 stickers initially.

Finally, Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 30 stickers, Seth must have had 2 * 30 = 60 stickers initially.

The final answer is: 60"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a candy connoisseur and M&M expert. I'd be delighted to help you with your question.

To determine the number of small bags John can make, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's he has. Since each large bag weighs 10 ounces and contains 30 M&M's per ounce, we can multiply the number of bags by the weight and then by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Total M&M's = 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag * 30 M&M's/ounce
Total M&M's = 3 * 10 * 30
Total M&M's = 900

Now, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag to find the number of small bags.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag
Number of small bags = 900 / 10
Number of small bags = 90

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags with 10 M&M's in each bag.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a wildlife expert specializing in seabirds. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the number of days it will take Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to divide the distance by his daily flying distance.

First, let's calculate half of the earth's circumference: 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Now, we can divide the distance Alfie needs to fly by his daily distance: 20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days.

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is 50."
"Hello there! I'm Yumi, a car enthusiast and speed expert. I'd be happy to help you find the speed of the fastest car.

To calculate the speed of the faster car, we need to follow these steps:

Let's denote the speed of the average car as A, the speed of the 2nd fastest car as B, and the speed of the fastest car as C. We know that:

A = 120 mph (given)

We also know that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so:

B = 5A
B = 5 * 120
B = 600 mph

Now, we know that the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so:

C = 1.25B
C = 1.25 * 600
C = 750 mph

Therefore, the faster car can go 750 mph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Liam is 16 years old now, and two years ago, his age was twice the age of Vince. To find Vince's current age, we can set up an equation.

Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as x. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can write the equation:

16 - 2 = 2x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

14 = 2x

To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 14/2
x = 7

Now, we need to find Vince's current age. Since 2 years have passed, we add 2 to his age two years ago:

Vince's current age = x + 2
Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

The final answer is 9."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

We're given that Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted 56 Easter eggs. We also know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A and the number of eggs Madeline painted as M. Since they painted the same number, we have A = M.

We're also told that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as S. We can express this as C + S = 30, and since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, we have C = S + 12.

Now, let's use the information we have to solve for the number of eggs each person painted. We know that A + M + C + S = 56. Since A = M, we can substitute M for A, giving us M + M + C + S = 56, which simplifies to 2M + C + S = 56.

We can substitute C = S + 12 into this equation, giving us 2M + (S + 12) + S = 56. Simplifying, we get 2M + 2S + 12 = 56. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we have 2M + 2S = 44. Dividing both sides by 2, we get M + S = 22.

We know that C = S + 12, and we also know that C + S = 30. Substituting C = S + 12 into the second equation, we get (S + 12) + S = 30. Simplifying, we get 2S + 12 = 30. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we have 2S = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9.

Now that we know S = 9, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, giving us C = 9 + 12 = 21.

We also know that M + S = 22, and since S = 9, we can substitute S into this equation, giving us M + 9 = 22. Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get M = 13.

Now that we know M = 13, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted. This is C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes separately.

First, let's find the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is:

Weight of crayons = Number of crayons * Weight of each crayon
= 200 * 1
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of crayons to pounds:

Weight of crayons (in pounds) = Weight of crayons (in ounces) / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

Now, let's find the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes. So, the total weight of the boxes is:

Weight of boxes = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Converting the weight of boxes to pounds:

Weight of boxes (in pounds) = Weight of boxes (in ounces) / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

Finally, the total weight of the crayons and boxes is the sum of their individual weights:

Total weight = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a forestry expert with extensive experience in timber management. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine the total number of logs John can make, we need to calculate the usable length of the tree. Since John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we'll find 80% of 80 feet.

80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet

Now, we'll divide the usable length by the length of each log to find the number of logs.

64 feet / 4 feet/log = 16 logs

Since each log can be cut into 5 planks, we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to calculate their combined salaries.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of her brother's salary. So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a walking enthusiast and fitness expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Let's denote the time spent on the beach as x minutes. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, the time spent on the sidewalk will be half the time spent on the beach, which is x/2 minutes.

We are given that 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, so we can set up the equation:

x = 40

Now, we can find the time spent on the sidewalk:

Time on sidewalk = x/2 = 40/2 = 20 minutes

Now, we can add the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time:

Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
= 40 + 20
= 60 minutes

Therefore, it takes Grandma 60 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we need to calculate the remaining amount she needs to save. Since she saves $4 per week, we can find the remaining amount by subtracting the amount she has already saved from the total amount:

$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we can divide the remaining amount by the amount she saves per week to find out how many more weeks it will take:

$28 ÷ $4 = 7

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

Final answer: 7"

To determine the total number of blue birds in the trees, we need to calculate the number of birds in each type of tree and then add them together.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so we can calculate the total number of birds in these trees as 3 x 7 = 21.

Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so we can calculate the total number of birds in these trees as 2 x 4 = 8.

One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many marbles Bob has initially, we need to determine how many marbles he has after receiving 2 dozen more marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24.

If Bob has 60 marbles after receiving 24 more, we can set up an equation to find the initial number of marbles:

Initial marbles + 24 = 60

Subtracting 24 from both sides gives us:

Initial marbles = 60 - 24
Initial marbles = 36

Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, we can find the final number of marbles by subtracting 10 from the initial number:

Final marbles = Initial marbles - 10
Final marbles = 36 - 10
Final marbles = 26

The final answer is 26."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a thermodynamics expert. Let's dive into this problem.

To solve this, we need to consider the temperature of the water in both mugs. Donny can drink the water if it's at least 40 degrees. We know one mug is 33 degrees, and he pours 4 ounces from it into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other mug. This means the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as x degrees. Since the total amount of water is 5 ounces, and 4 ounces come from the 33-degree mug, the amount of water in the other mug is 5 - 4 = 1 ounce.

We can set up an equation based on the heat transfer: the heat lost by the 33-degree water equals the heat gained by the 1-ounce water in the other mug. The heat lost by the 33-degree water is 4 ounces * (33 - 40) = -52 ounces-degrees. The heat gained by the 1-ounce water in the other mug is 1 ounce * (x - 40).

Equating the two, we get: -52 = 1 * (x - 40). Solving for x, we get x = 32.

However, we know that the temperature of the other mug must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink the water. Since x = 32 is less than 40, we need to re-examine our assumptions.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a farm management specialist with expertise in animal husbandry and agricultural economics. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total number of animals on Melanie's farm after three weeks.

To determine the total number of animals, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initial number of cows: 50
Initial number of chickens: 20

Number of cows added per day: 20
Number of chickens added per day: 10

Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Total number of cows added: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of chickens added: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Total number of cows after 3 weeks: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
Total number of chickens after 3 weeks: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Total number of animals after 3 weeks: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a bagel connoisseur and expert in bagel economics. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the cost of each bagel after a 10% discount, we need to first find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels. Since each pack costs $10.00, the total cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Next, we need to calculate the discount amount. 10% of $40.00 is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we can find the cost of each bagel by dividing the total cost by 9, since there are 9 bagels in each pack. 

$36.00 ÷ 9 = $4.00

The final answer is: $4.00"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a culinary expert specializing in mashed potatoes. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Gomer ate 5 scoops of mashed potatoes, and we need to find out how many potatoes he ate.

We're given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. To start, let's find out how many potatoes are needed for 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

3 scoops - 1 scoop = 2 scoops
6 potatoes - 3 potatoes = 3 potatoes

Now, we know that 3 potatoes are needed for 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we divide 3 potatoes by 2 scoops.

3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop

Since Gomer ate 5 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can now find out how many potatoes he ate by multiplying the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop.

5 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 7.5 potatoes

However, we're told that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many scoops he actually ate, we subtract 5 from 23.

23 scoops - 5 scoops = 18 scoops

Now, we can find out how many potatoes Gomer ate by multiplying the actual number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop.

18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes

But wait, we're told that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we need to subtract 5 from the total number of potatoes.

27 potatoes - 5 = 22 potatoes

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a nutrition expert. Let's break down Chester's egg consumption to determine how many dozens he'll need for 60 days.

To calculate the total number of eggs Chester needs, we can add the eggs he consumes in the first 30 days to the eggs he consumes in the next 30 days. 

First, let's calculate the eggs he eats in the first 30 days: 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

Next, we'll calculate the eggs he eats in the next 30 days: 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we'll add these two amounts together: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs: 240 ÷ 12 = 20.

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

The final answer is 20."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. To find the number of red jellybeans, we can multiply the number of green jellybeans by 2.

Number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17
= 34

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We also know that there are 17 green jellybeans and 34 red jellybeans. To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51
= 9

The number of blue jellybeans is 9."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation analyst. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the number of women on the bus, we first need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 (men) + 9 (women) = 14 parts.

Next, we divide the total number of passengers by the total number of parts to find the value of one part: 84 ÷ 14 = 6.

Since the ratio of women is 9 parts, we multiply 9 by the value of one part: 9 × 6 = 54.

Now, we know that 20 women alighted from the bus. To find the number of women who remained, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women: 54 - 20 = 34.

To determine the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of bouquets sold and then multiply it by the number of sunflowers in each bouquet.

Faraday earned $56 from the bouquet per day, and he sold it for 3 days, so the total number of bouquets sold is $56 / $8 = 7.

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold is 7 * 12 = 84.

Therefore, Faraday was able to sell 84 sunflowers after 3 days.

Final answer: 84"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Adam wants to open a rock stand and invests all his $100. He buys rocks for $5 each and sells them for $7 each. However, he only sells 60% of his inventory.

Let's calculate the number of rocks Adam buys:

Number of rocks = Total investment / Cost per rock
= $100 / $5
= 20 rocks

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, the number of rocks sold is:

Number of rocks sold = 0.6 * 20
= 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks is:

Revenue = Number of rocks sold * Selling price per rock
= 12 * $7
= $84

The cost of the rocks sold is:

Cost = Number of rocks sold * Cost per rock
= 12 * $5
= $60

The loss is the difference between the revenue and the cost:

Loss = Cost - Revenue
= $60 - $84
= -$24

Since we can't have a negative loss, this means Adam can't sell all his rocks at $7 each. However, we can calculate the loss if he sells 60% of his inventory.

The correct answer is:

Loss = $24"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a florist with extensive experience in rose arrangements. Let's break down the situation:

Patricia initially had 30 roses. She then gave 24 roses to her mother, which reduced her total to 30 - 24 = 6 roses. After that, she bought 15 more roses to add to her collection.

To find the total number of roses Patricia has now, we can simply add the number of roses she had left after giving some away to the number of roses she bought.

Total number of roses now = Initial number of roses - Number of roses given to her mother + Number of roses bought
= 30 - 24 + 15
= 21

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses.

Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, we'll find the total time taken: 
Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula: 
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour

Therefore, the average speed is 50 miles per hour."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a statistics expert. When it comes to calculating the probability of independent events, I always follow the rule of multiplication. In this case, we have two independent events: Mark buying a lottery ticket with a 20% chance of winning and buying a second ticket that's three times more likely to win.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. The probability of the first ticket winning is 0.2, and the probability of the second ticket winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, let's calculate the probability of both tickets winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into the problem of finding out how many seashells each person got when they divided the total number of seashells equally among themselves.

To start, we know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. Let's represent the number of seashells Carlos collected as x. Then, we can set up an equation:

x + 5 = 27

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

Since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, we can represent Carrey's seashells as x/2. Now we have:

x = 22
x/2 = Carrey's seashells

Now, let's find the total number of seashells. We know that the total number of seashells is the sum of what Carlos, Jim, and Carrey collected:

Total seashells = x + 27 + x/2

Substituting x = 22, we get:

Total seashells = 22 + 27 + 22/2
Total seashells = 22 + 27 + 11
Total seashells = 60

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got:

Seashells per person = Total seashells / 3
Seashells per person = 60 / 3
Seashells per person = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"

4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend:
20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst with expertise in profit calculations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

First, we calculate the total cost of the devices. Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday. The cost of each device is $20.

Total cost = (2 devices * $20) + (4 devices * $20)
Total cost = $40 + $80
Total cost = $120

Next, we calculate the total selling price. Linus sells each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40 per device.

Total selling price = (2 devices * $40) + (4 devices * $40)
Total selling price = $80 + $160
Total selling price = $240

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total selling price.

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $120
Profit = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a geometry expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We're given that Isabel is 7 feet tall. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 feet - 2 feet
Ned's height = 5 feet

Now, we know Carl is one foot taller than Ned. So, Carl's height can be calculated as:

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 feet + 1 foot
Carl's height = 6 feet

Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, we can calculate the length of the cane as:

Length of cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of cane = 6 feet / 2
Length of cane = 3 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a nutrition expert specializing in food production and supply chain management. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many more bottles of carrot juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people and then divide it by the number of bottles each bottle can cover.

Energy demand per person = 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand
Energy demand per person = 0.2 * 1 = 0.2
Total energy demand of 2300 people = 0.2 * 2300 = 460 people's energy demand

Since each bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the number of bottles needed to cover 460 people's energy demand.

Number of bottles needed = 460 people's energy demand / 20% of 1 person's energy demand
Number of bottles needed = 460 / 0.2
Number of bottles needed = 2300

However, Hortex can only produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of bottles needed and the number of bottles they can produce per day.

Additional bottles needed = 2300 - 4200
Additional bottles needed = -1900

Since we can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the number of bottles needed per day to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Let's recalculate the number of bottles needed per day to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Number of bottles needed per day = 2300 / 0.2
Number of bottles needed per day = 11500

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many days it will take to produce 11500 bottles.

Number of days = 11500 / 4200

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a statistician specializing in probability and data analysis. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies (since it's an octuplet).

Number of babies wearing purple = 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue = 1/4 * 8 = 2

Number of babies wearing bows = 1/3 * (number of purple wearers) + (number of blue wearers) 
= 1/3 * 6 + 2
= 2 + 2
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:
Probability = (number of purple bow wearers) / (total number of bow wearers)
= (number of purple wearers) / (number of purple wearers + number of blue wearers)
= 6 / (6 + 2)
= 6 / 8
= 3/4
= 0.75
= 75%

The probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 75%."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a tax expert with extensive experience in analyzing tax reports. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on all days.

Total reports received = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a real estate appraiser. I'd be happy to help you with calculating Abraham's total earnings from selling his unused land.

To determine Abraham's total earnings, we need to calculate the amount he earned from each land sale and add them together.

Abraham initially sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. This means he sold 40 square meters of land for $50. To find the price per square meter, we can divide $50 by 40 square meters:

$50 ÷ 40 m² = $1.25 per square meter

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. This is equivalent to selling 20 square meters of land. To find the price per square meter, we can divide $30 by 20 square meters:

$30 ÷ 20 m² = $1.50 per square meter

Now, we know the prices per square meter for both land sales. To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the earnings from each land sale and add them together.

Abraham sold 40 square meters for $50, and 20 square meters for $30. He also has 20 square meters left, which he sold for $3 per square meter. To find the earnings from the remaining land, we can multiply the price per square meter by the number of square meters:

20 m² × $3/m² = $60

Now, let's add up the earnings from all land sales:

$50 + $30 + $60 = $140

The final answer is: $140"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. Since Haley is 26 years old, we can calculate half of her age as follows:

Half of Haley's age = 26 / 2 = 13

Since Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age, we subtract 10 from 13:

Geb's age = 13 - 10
Geb's age = 3

So, Geb is 3 years old.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is equivalent to 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we need to subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs. Let's calculate the total number of eggs found: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a waste management specialist. I'd be happy to help you with calculating John's weekly earnings.

To determine John's total weekly earnings, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply it by the payment per collection.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have a combined total of 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it has 1.6 times the number of apartments. Therefore, the last complex has 400 * 1.6 = 640 apartments.

Now, let's add up the total number of apartments: 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1440 * 3 = 4320.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 4320 * 0.40 = $1728.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a botanist specializing in avocado cultivation. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to consider the production patterns described in the problem.

Let's break it down year by year:

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 times the amount from Year 2, so 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 times the amount from Year 3, so 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 times the amount from Year 4, so 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 times the amount from Year 5, so 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 times the amount from Year 6 minus 200, so 10 * 7350 - 200 = 73500 - 200 = 73400 fruits
Year 9: No fruit production
Year 10: 20 times the initial amount, so 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 73400 + 0 + 1000 = 52500

The total number of fruits that an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 52500."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a textile expert with a focus on rope materials and applications. I'd be happy to help you solve the problem.

Let's break down the information given:

We have three ropes: a red rope, a blue rope, and a yellow rope. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters.

To solve this problem, we can start by denoting the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write an equation:
B = Y - 7

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write another equation:
R = 4B

Now, we are given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write a third equation:
Y + B + R = 37

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y into the third equation, we get:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5. So, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount of money she has left is 15 - x.

Since she is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

To solve for x, we can multiply 4/5 by 15:

15 - x = 12

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 15 - 12
x = 3

So, Rissa gave her sister $3. Now, we know that Rissa has 15 - 3 = $12 left.

Since Ronnie gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3. Now, we can find out how much money Ronnie has left:

Ronnie's initial money: $5
Ronnie gave her sister: $3
Ronnie's remaining money: $5 - $3 = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a mural artist with expertise in color theory and composition. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

To determine the amount of red paint used, let's break down the information given. We know that the mural has four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can represent the amount of each of these colors as 'x'. The amount of yellow paint is also 'x', as half the mural is yellow.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so we can set up the equation: x + x + x + x = 12. Simplifying this equation, we get 4x = 12.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4, which gives us x = 3.

Since 'x' represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 3 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a home design expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 feet x 12 feet = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 x 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a household budgeting expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we need to calculate the cost per pod. The new box has 120 pods and costs $12. 

Cost per pod = Total cost / Total pods
= $12 / 120
= $0.1 per pod

Now, we can divide the amount you have ($1) by the cost per pod to find the number of cycles:
$1 / $0.1 per pod = 10 cycles

So, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sports analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast and educator. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining chalk, we need to calculate the remaining amount of chalk and then divide it by the daily usage rate.

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. To find the remaining amount, we subtract the used amount from the total:

Remaining chalk = Total chalk - Used chalk
= 5 inches - (0.45 * 5 inches)
= 5 inches - 2.25 inches
= 2.75 inches

Now, we know the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. To find the number of days it will take to use up the remaining chalk, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily usage rate:

Number of days = Remaining chalk / Daily usage rate
= 2.75 inches / 0.20
= 13.75 days

Since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the remaining chalk is still greater than 2 inches, so we can round down to 13 days.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we need to first calculate the number of students on varsity. We know that one-third of the girls and one-fourth of the boys are on varsity.

Number of girls on varsity = 1/3 * 12 = 4
Number of boys on varsity = 1/4 * 12 = 3

Total number of students on varsity = 4 + 3 = 7

Now, we can find the number of students not on varsity by subtracting the total number of students on varsity from the total number of students in the class.

Total number of students in the class = 12 + 12 = 24

Number of students not on varsity = Total number of students - Total number of students on varsity
= 24 - 7
= 17

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a dental hygienist with over 10 years of experience. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixed, we need to calculate the total number of teeth fixed and then divide it by the total number of teeth.

Number of teeth drilled = 4
Number of teeth capped = 7 + 4 = 11 (since the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills)

Total number of teeth fixed = 4 + 11 = 15

Total number of teeth = 30

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15/30) * 100 = 50%

So, the dentist fixed 50% of James' teeth.

The final answer is 50."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this age-related puzzle.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

We're given two statements:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's represent Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we can write an equation:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

Now, let's use the second statement to create another equation. We know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting W = 5C + 35 into the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27,000. We know that 100 books cost $500, so we can divide the total amount by the cost of 100 books.

$27,000 ÷ $500 = 54 sets of 100 books

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we can divide the total number of sets by 3 to find out how many sets each school will get.

54 sets ÷ 3 schools = 18 sets per school

Now, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find out the total number of books each school will get.

18 sets per school × 100 books per set = 1800 books per school

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

The final answer is: 1800"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples. Then, he put 1 apple in his pocket and threw 1 apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. This means he now has 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples.

Next, he put all but 1 apple in his pocket, so he has 7 - 1 = 6 apples left. He then threw 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. So, he now has 6 (previous) + 6 (new) = 12 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a food enthusiast and pizza connoisseur. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each friend eats and then divide that by the total number of slices per pizza.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so the total number of slices each friend eats is 6 + 4 = 10 slices.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. To find out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to divide the total number of slices eaten (60) by the total number of slices per pizza (12 + 8 = 20).

60 ÷ 20 = 3

So, Kate needs to buy 3 pizzas.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

Jay is making snowballs to prepare for a snowball fight with his sister. He can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. To find out how long it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs he builds per hour.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in an hour. 

So, the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour is 20 - 8 = 12.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 12 snowballs per hour. 

60 / 12 = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to build 60 snowballs.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a nurse with extensive experience in managing hospital supplies. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine the initial number of bandages, let's analyze the situation step by step.

The nurses used 38 bandages on the first day and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. This means they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. Adding the remaining 12 bandages from the first day, they had a total of 28 + 12 = 40 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, totaling 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had 40 - 25 = 15 bandages left.

Since they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, and they had 15 bandages left after the third day, they must have had 78 + 15 = 93 bandages at the beginning of the third day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{93}$"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst with expertise in calculating costs and expenses. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total cost, we need to first find the cost of the scotch and the cognac.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:
$600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. To find the cost of the cognac per bottle, we multiply the cost of the scotch by 1.5 (100% + 50%):
$60 × 1.5 = $90 per bottle

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 × $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac:
$600 + $1800 = $2400.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a forestry expert with a passion for tree planting. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

The total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees.

The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80 trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 (first day) + 80 (second day) = 140 trees.

To calculate the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to consider the volume of the jar and the packing efficiency. The jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches, so its volume is:

V = length × width × height = 6 × 6 × 15 = 540 cubic inches

However, the jelly beans are not packed perfectly, so we need to account for the packing efficiency. Assuming a random close packing of spheres (which is a common assumption for jelly beans), the packing efficiency is approximately 0.64. Therefore, the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is:

N = V / (packing efficiency × volume of a single jelly bean)
= 540 / (0.64 × 0.15)
= 540 / 0.096
= 5625

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is:

Number of red jelly beans = 0.3 × 5625
= 1687.5

However, we know the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number:

Difference = 1687.5 - 900
= 787.5

The final answer is: $\boxed{787.5}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation expert with a focus on bus capacity management. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, let's break down the information step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, bringing the total to 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered at the second station, making the total 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, resulting in 90 * 2 = 180 people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the remaining spaces are 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a museum enthusiast and cost analyst. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down her expenses into two periods: the first 5 years and the next 3 years.

Initially, the cost of one visit was $2. After a 150% increase, the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, so she spent 5 * 3 = $15 per year. For 5 years, she spent 5 * $15 = $75.

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit is $5, and she visited the museum 3 times a year, so she spent 3 * $5 = $15 per year. For 3 years, she spent 3 * $15 = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits is $75 + $45 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this challenge.

To determine the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students/grade * 3 grades = 30 students
30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students.

The time required for each group is 45 minutes. So, the total time required for 3 full groups is:

3 groups * 45 minutes/group = 135 minutes

For the 4th group with 2 students, the time required is 45 minutes.

Total time required = 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a carpentry expert with extensive experience in measuring and cutting wood. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the length of the longer piece of wood, let's break it down step by step. We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, its length can be represented as 4x.

We can set up an equation to represent the total length of the board:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a culinary expert with extensive experience in meat preparation. When it comes to making meatballs, the key is to balance flavors and textures. In Aiden's case, he's using a steakhouse-seasoned meat mixture, which requires a specific ratio of seasoning to meat.

To determine the amount of seasoning needed, we can start by calculating the total amount of meat required to produce 80 meatballs. Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide the total number of meatballs by 16 to find the number of pounds needed.

80 meatballs ÷ 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Now, we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat. Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound, we can multiply the number of pounds by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning required.

5 pounds × 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for the cookout.

The final answer is: 10"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a home decor expert. When it comes to calculating fabric requirements for curtains, I always consider the total width of the windows and the desired width of the fabric.

To determine the amount of fabric Luke needs, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. In this case, there are five windows, each 35 inches wide.

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

To make it easier to work with, let's convert the total fabric needed to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we can divide the total inches by 12.

Total fabric needed (in feet) = Total fabric needed (in inches) / 12
Total fabric needed (in feet) = 350 / 12
Total fabric needed (in feet) = 29.17 feet

To be safe, it's always a good idea to add a few extra feet to the total to account for any errors or irregularities. Let's round up to the nearest half foot.

Total fabric needed (in feet) = 29.17 + 0.5
Total fabric needed (in feet) = 29.67 feet

The final answer is: 29.67"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst with expertise in calculating costs and expenses. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, so the total cost is:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a meteorologist. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. Then, we add 1 more inch to this amount, so the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a pastry expert with a passion for baking. I'd be delighted to help you solve the problem.

To determine the number of cupcakes Carly made, let's break down the information given. We know that she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If we represent the number of cupcakes as x, then the number of brownies can be expressed as 3x - 2.

Since each person in Carly's class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. This can be represented as an equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

To solve for x, we can start by combining like terms:

x + 3x - 2 = 10

This simplifies to:

4x - 2 = 10

Next, we add 2 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable:

4x = 12

Finally, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:

x = 12/4

x = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a skilled nail technician with extensive experience in providing top-notch manicures and pedicures. I'd be delighted to help you calculate the total cost for Karen's services.

To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure, and then add the cost of the nail art.

The original cost of the manicure is $35, and the pedicure is $40. The total cost without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75. The 20% discount is 0.20 * $75 = $15. So, the discounted price is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art sessions (5 for each hand). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

Final answer: $90"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a magazine enthusiast and expert in magazine subscription analysis. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to consider the number of issues each magazine sends and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send a total of 3 x 12 = 36 issues per year.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 1 x 6 = 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 x 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

The final answer is: 66"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a professional artist and art historian. I'd be happy to help you with this painting-related problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. We can represent the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley's paintings can be represented as x + 8. Samantha's paintings, which are 12 fewer than Shelley's, can be represented as (x + 8) - 12.

We're given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

To solve for x, we'll simplify the equation by combining like terms:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides gives us:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

The final answer is: 31"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a retail analyst. I'd be happy to help you with the price of the toy after the discounts.

To calculate the price after the discounts, we need to apply the percentage changes sequentially. 

First, we calculate the price increase in December: 
Initial price in November: $40
Price increase in December: 80% of $40 = 0.8 * $40 = $32
Price in December: $40 + $32 = $72

Next, we calculate the price decrease in January: 
Price in January: $72 - 50% of $72 = $72 - 0.5 * $72 = $72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"As a tennis coach, I've analyzed Charlie's lesson schedule to determine his total earnings for the day. To calculate his total earnings, we need to consider the standard rate and the reduced rate for veteran lessons.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the 4 one-hour lessons at the standard rate of $80 per hour:
4 * $80 = $320

Next, we need to calculate the earnings from the 2 one-hour lessons with a veteran. Since Charlie reduces his rate by 25% for veteran lessons, we need to find 25% of the standard rate:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20

Now, subtract the reduced rate from the standard rate:
$80 - $20 = $60

Multiply the reduced rate by the number of lessons:
2 * $60 = $120

Finally, add the earnings from both types of lessons:
$320 + $120 = $440

Therefore, Charlie will make a total of $440 for the day."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fruit expert. Let's solve the problem step by step.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first find out how many pomelos she had left. Since she had 1/4 of the original amount left, we can set up the equation:

20 - (1/4) * 20 = ?

To calculate 1/4 of 20, we multiply 20 by 1/4:

(1/4) * 20 = 5

Now, we subtract 5 from 20:

20 - 5 = 15

So, Eve had 15 pomelos left.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she had left from the original amount:

20 - 15 = 5

Therefore, Eve gave away 5 pomelos.

The final answer is 5."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Walter initially bought 60 apples. To find out how many he ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples

Now, we know Walter ate 24 apples. To find the remaining number of apples, we subtract 24 from 60.

60 - 24 = 36 apples

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25.

36 * 0.25 = 9 apples

Now, we subtract the apples given to his sister from the remaining apples.

36 - 9 = 27 apples

Finally, Walter sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount he received, we multiply the number of apples sold by the price per apple.

27 * 3 = $81

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation engineer with expertise in route planning and analysis. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we need to first determine the total hours he traveled. Assuming a 24-hour day, Michael traveled for 3 days, so the total hours he traveled is 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Next, we can calculate the distance covered by multiplying his average speed by the total hours traveled:

Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance covered = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we can divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 / 6000) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a book organization expert. I'd be happy to help you determine the number of bookcases Elly needs.

To calculate the total capacity of the shelves, we need to consider the capacity of each shelf. Since the middle two shelves can hold 10 books each, and the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, it can hold 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the shelves:
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books
Total capacity: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves to find the number of bookcases needed:

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast and problem solver. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to get correct overall. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, and the total number of questions is 110 (70 from the first test and 40 from the second test), we can calculate this as follows:

Total questions needed correct = 0.7 * 110
Total questions needed correct = 77

Now, let's find out how many questions Audrey got correct on the first test. Since she got 60% of the first test correct, we can calculate this as follows:

Questions correct on the first test = 0.6 * 70
Questions correct on the first test = 42

To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the questions she got correct on the first test from the total questions needed correct:

Questions needed correct on the second test = Total questions needed correct - Questions correct on the first test

First, we need to calculate the total number of candles. Since there are 8 rooms in the house, and half of them have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each, we can calculate the total number of candles as follows:

Total number of small candles = 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 candles
Total number of medium candles = 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 candles
Total number of candles = 16 + 20 = 36 candles

Next, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights. Since there are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight, the total number of flashlights is:

Total number of flashlights = 4 people * 1 flashlight/person = 4 flashlights

Now, let's summarize the total number of candles and flashlights:

Total number of candles and flashlights = 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a food enthusiast and expert in snack distribution. I'd be happy to help you with dividing the nachos among Mitchell's family.

To determine the number of chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. Since Mitchell buys two bags of chips with 55 chips each, the total number of chips is:

2 bags * 55 chips per bag = 110 chips

Now, let's divide the total number of chips by the number of family members (5):

110 chips ÷ 5 = 22 chips per person

So, each person in Mitchell's family will get 22 chips.

The final answer is: 22"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a skilled Rubik's Cube solver. Let's break down the time it takes to solve the cube step by step.

To solve the cube, we need to consider the time it takes to complete each side. The first side takes 5 minutes. The second and third sides take twice as long, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes. The last two sides take half as long as the first, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

The total time to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a robotics engineer with expertise in designing and optimizing robotic systems. I'm here to help you with your question.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs. We know there are 20 helmets, so we can calculate the number of footballs and robots.

First, we'll find the number of footballs. Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can set up an equation:

Number of helmets = Number of footballs / 2
20 = Number of footballs / 2
Number of footballs = 20 * 2
Number of footballs = 40

Next, we'll find the number of robots. Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can set up another equation:

Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a management consultant specializing in operational efficiency. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first determine the total number of minutes he spends on calls in a week. Since Tim spends 6 hours a day on calls, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

6 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day

Since there are 5 days in a work week, the total number of minutes he spends on calls in a week is:

360 minutes/day × 5 days/week = 1800 minutes/week

Now, we can calculate the total number of calls he deals with in a week by dividing the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a call (15 minutes):

1800 minutes/week ÷ 15 minutes/call = 120 calls/week

Therefore, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a professional artist and expert in varnish application. When it comes to varnish drying times, I always pay close attention to the specifics.

To determine how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the difference in drying times.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

The final answer is: 30"

"Hello there! I'm Yumi, a wildlife biologist specializing in amphibian behavior and ecology. I'm happy to help you with Phineas Frog's journey back home.

To calculate the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to consider the time spent hopping on land and swimming in water. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the time for each part separately.

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute
Time on land = 5 minutes

Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute
Time in water = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on land + Time in water
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a phone plan expert. Let's break down the costs of the phone plan.

The main phone costs $20, and each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone. To find the cost of each additional phone, we can divide the cost of the main phone by 2.

Cost of each additional phone = $20 ÷ 2 = $10

Since there are four additional phones, the total cost of the additional phones is:

Total cost of additional phones = 4 x $10 = $40

Now, let's add the cost of the main phone to find the total cost of the whole phone plan:

Total cost of the whole phone plan = $20 (main phone) + $40 (additional phones) = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a pastry expert with a focus on bakery operations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate Derrick's total earnings in June, we need to first determine the total number of doughnuts he sells. Since he makes 10 dozen doughnuts per day, and there are 12 doughnuts in a dozen, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts per day as follows:

10 dozen doughnuts/day × 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

Since June has 30 days, Derrick's total doughnut production for the month is:

120 doughnuts/day × 30 days = 3600 doughnuts

Now, we can calculate Derrick's total earnings by multiplying the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut:

3600 doughnuts × $2/doughnut = $7200

Therefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June.

The final answer is: $7200"

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a speech-language pathologist with expertise in assessing and improving communication skills. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first find his new speed in words per minute. 

John's original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 2.5 * 150 = 375 WPM.

Since each page has 450 words, the total number of words in 10 pages is 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we divide the total number of words by the speed:

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a beach enthusiast and data analyst. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week.

To find the total number of people, we need to break down the information day by day.

On the first day, Conor found 50 people at the beach. The next day, 20 more people were present, so the total number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, which is 70 * 2 = 140 people.

For the remaining four days, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. To find the total number of people for these days, we multiply the average by the number of days: 60 * 4 = 240 people.

Now, let's add up the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:
50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400 people

The final answer is: 400"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a food scientist specializing in thermal processing and food technology. I'd be happy to help you with the popcorn problem.

To calculate the total number of popped kernels, let's break down the popping process into four stages:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, 3 times the amount of the first 30 seconds pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to 4 times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped:
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels

In the final 30 seconds, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add the additional 10 kernels to the total:
200 + 10 = 210 kernels

The farm has 40 pairs of animal legs in total."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the tower has 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks. This means the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

To find the total number of blue and yellow blocks, we simply add them together: 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, we can set up an equation to find the number of red blocks: 12 (blue and yellow blocks) + x (red blocks) = 32.

Solving for x, we get: x = 32 - 12
x = 20

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

The final answer is: 20"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a transportation expert with a focus on route analysis. Let's break down Elvis's journey step by step.

To determine the distance Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, we calculate the distance for each part of the journey:

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first part of the journey (west), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

For the second part of the journey (east), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Total distance traveled = 90 miles + 144 miles = 234 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. To do this, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

Final answer: 54"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst with expertise in depreciation calculations. Let's break down the depreciation of the boat over the three years.

To calculate the value of the boat after each year, we'll apply the depreciation rates to the initial value.

Year 1:
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after 1 year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after 2 years = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after 3 years = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a candy connoisseur and expert in candy analysis. I've been studying the composition of various candy bags, and I'm excited to help you solve this problem.

Let's break down the information given:

We know that the bag contains 232 pieces of individually wrapped candies. The number of red candies is 54, which is a relatively standard size for a bag of Starbursts.

The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so:
Orange candies = 2 * 54 = 108

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so:
Yellow candies = 54 / 2 = 27

Now, let's find the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
Red + Orange + Yellow = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies in the bag:
232 - 189 = 43

Therefore, there are 43 pink candies in the bag.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43}$"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a travel expert with extensive knowledge of European destinations. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of Helen's trip to Germany.

To determine the total cost of the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the bus trips first. Since each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, we can calculate the cost of one bus trip as follows:

Cost of one bus trip = 10% of $80
= 0.1 x $80
= $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is:

Total cost of bus trips = $8 x 7
= $56

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is the sum of these two costs:

Total cost = $80 (hotel) + $56 (bus trips)
= $136

Therefore, Helen paid a total of $136 for her hotel and bus travels during the trip.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Mazie has 52 marbles and gives them to twins, Dallas and Darla. We also know that Dallas drops 4 marbles in the playground and ends up with 21. To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first find out how many marbles Dallas had initially.

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Dallas' initial marbles = 21 (final marbles) + 4 (dropped marbles)
Dallas' initial marbles = 21 + 4
Dallas' initial marbles = 25

Now that we know Dallas had 25 marbles initially, we can find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla by subtracting 25 from 52.

Mazie's marbles given to Darla = 52 (Mazie's marbles) - 25 (Dallas' initial marbles)
Mazie's marbles given to Darla = 52 - 25
Mazie's marbles given to Darla = 27

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a mechanical engineer with expertise in physics and mechanics. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."

To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we add the lengths of all four sides. In this case, the long side is 20 feet and the short side is 15 feet.

Perimeter = 2 * (long side + short side)
Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a farm animal nutritionist. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how much feed is left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs in a week. Since each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, we can calculate the daily feed consumption as follows:

Daily feed consumption per pig = 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 8 pounds/pig/day

Total daily feed consumption for 5 pigs = 8 pounds/pig/day * 5 pigs = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7:

Total weekly feed consumption = 40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Now, let's subtract the total feed consumed from the total ordered feed to find out how much is left:

Feed left = Total ordered feed - Total weekly feed consumption
= 300 pounds - 280 pounds
= 20 pounds

The final answer is: 20"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a food scientist specializing in food logistics and supply chain management. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the cost of hot dogs for John's party.

To determine the total number of hot dogs needed, we can multiply the number of guests by the number of hot dogs each guest will eat. 

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs required: 20 * 2 = 40

Since John already has 4 hot dogs, we subtract those from the total:
40 - 4 = 36

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs.
Number of packs needed: 36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs 6 packs, and each pack costs $2, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
6 * $2 = $12

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

The final answer is: $12"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Frances sells cupcakes and cookies, and she buys trays of cupcakes. To find out how much money she has left, we need to calculate her total income and total expenses.

First, let's calculate her total income from cupcakes: 20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40.
Next, let's calculate her total income from cookies: 40 cookies * $1 per cookie = $40.
Now, we add her total income from cupcakes and cookies: $40 + $40 = $80.

Frances buys 5 trays of cupcakes at $4 per tray. To find her total expenses, we multiply the number of trays by the cost per tray: 5 trays * $4 per tray = $20.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The ice cream truck starts with 5 children. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10. This is a simple addition problem.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children. To find the total number of children, we need to add 10 (the number of children from the previous step) and 10*2 (the number of children joining from the third street). This can be calculated as 10 + 20 = 30.

However, the original 5 children then leave the group. To find the final number of children following the truck, we need to subtract 5 from the total number of children. So, 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 children following the ice cream truck.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a humanitarian aid specialist with expertise in disaster relief and food distribution. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To determine how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to calculate the total number of meals she has already given out and subtract that from the total number of meals available.

Total meals = 1,360
Meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48 = 142

Meals left = Total meals - Meals given out
Meals left = 1,360 - 142
Meals left = 1,218

Therefore, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.

The final answer is: 1218"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's calculate the total amount of money James has.

To find the total amount, we need to add the values of each coin. A quarter is worth 25 cents, two nickels are worth 10 cents, and seven dimes are worth 70 cents. 

We can add these values together: 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = 105 cents.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters in the family. The age of the sisters is the same, which is 16 years old. One of the brothers is 12 years old, and this is half the age of the older brother. 

To find the age of the older brother, we can multiply the age of the younger brother by 2. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now that we know the age of the older brother, we can find the total age of the siblings. We have 2 brothers with ages 12 and 24, and 3 sisters with ages 16 each. 

To find the total age, we add up the ages of all the siblings: 
12 + 24 + (16 * 3) = 12 + 24 + 48 = 84

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a wellness expert with a focus on mindfulness and self-care practices. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga.

To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Time spent on meditation:
- 15 minutes per day
- 2 times a day (morning and evening)
- 4 weeks
- 7 days a week

Total time spent on meditation = 15 * 2 * 4 * 7 = 420 minutes

Time spent on yoga:
- 1 hour per day
- 5 days a week
- 4 weeks
- 7 days a week

Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can convert the time spent on yoga to minutes:
- 1 hour * 60 minutes/hour = 60 minutes per day
- 60 minutes * 5 days/week = 300 minutes per week
- 300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes

Total time spent on meditation and yoga = 420 minutes + 1200 minutes
Total time spent on meditation and yoga = 1620 minutes

To convert the total time to hours, we can divide by 60:
Total time spent on meditation and yoga = 1620 minutes / 60 = 27 hours

Therefore, Charisma has spent a total of 27 hours on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a quilting expert with extensive experience in fabric selection and layout. When it comes to creating a quilt, it's essential to calculate the total fabric area accurately to ensure a beautiful and functional piece.

To determine the total square feet of fabric needed, we can calculate the area of each type of shirt and add them together.

The area of each shirt is calculated as follows:
- Small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
- Medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
- Large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Now, let's add the total area of each type of shirt:
33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet

Therefore, the quilt will require 101 square feet of fabric.

The final answer is: 101"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a botanist specializing in flower cultivation. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of sunflower seeds, we need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then add 50% more seeds to it.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. Then, we add 18 to 36, resulting in 54 seeds.

Now, we add the seeds from the small sunflower (36) and the large sunflower (54) to get the total number of seeds: 36 + 54 = 90.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that George has 18 pens, and Timothy has three times as many pens as George. To find Timothy's pens, we can multiply George's pens by 3.

18 * 3 = 54

Now, we know Timothy has 54 pens. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can divide Timothy's pens by 2.

54 ÷ 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens.

The final answer is 27."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Albert is 36"" tall, and Anne is twice the size of Albert. To find Anne's height, we can multiply Albert's height by 2:

Anne's height = 2 x 36"" = 72""

We also know Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne. To find Jackie's height, we can subtract 2"" from Anne's height:

Jackie's height = 72"" - 2"" = 70""

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we need to subtract 3"" from her current height to find her height before the summer:

Jackie's height before summer = 70"" - 3"" = 67""

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fashion expert with a keen eye for deals and discounts. Let's break down Jake's shopping trip to determine the total amount he spent.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Since Jake buys two T-shirts, we'll apply the buy one get one 50% off deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. For the first T-shirt, Jake pays the full price, which is $8. For the second T-shirt, he gets a 50% discount, so the price is reduced by $4 (50% of $8). The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake buys them at 40% off. The discount is 40% of $40, which is $16. The cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

To find the total amount Jake spent, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down Ryan's situation step by step.

Ryan earns $6 each week for completing his chores. Since he did his chores for 3 weeks, his total earnings are:

6 * 3 = $18

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. The total cost of the ice cream cones is:

1.25 * 4 = $5

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings:

$18 - $5 = $13

Ryan has $13 left. To find out how many movie tickets he can buy, we'll divide $13 by the cost of each ticket, which is $6.50:

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a cookie connoisseur and baker. Let's break down Randy's cookie journey step by step.

Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. He then makes some changes:

1. He eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This means he consumes 3 cookies in total. To find out how many cookies he has left, we subtract 3 from the initial total:
   9 (oatmeal) + 4 (chocolate) + 5 (sugar) = 18 cookies
   18 - 3 = 15 cookies

2. He eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. Now, he has:
   15 - 2 = 13 cookies

3. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. This leaves him with:
   13 - 2 = 11 cookies

4. He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. This means he adds 8 new cookies to his collection:
   11 + 8 = 19 cookies

Randy now has 19 cookies in total.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a landscape architect with expertise in soil erosion and excavation management. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog. Since the dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, the total number of holes dug is:

6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Next, we need to find out how many holes Nate fills in per day. He fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net change in the number of holes per day is:

9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

To fill 84 holes, it will take:

84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:

28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

Final answer: 4"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a high school math teacher. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000
= 1000

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a laboratory assistant with expertise in inventory management and data analysis. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many beakers Igor lost, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of items he gathered and the total number of items he placed on the lab bench.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, beakers as B, and Petri dishes as P. We know that:

T = 8 (half of 16)
P = 16 + 2 = 18
B = 7 (correct number of beakers)

The total number of items gathered is T + B + P = 8 + 7 + 18 = 33.

However, the total number of items placed on the lab bench is 29. To find out how many beakers Igor lost, we need to subtract the total number of items placed on the lab bench from the total number of items gathered.

33 - 29 = 4

So, Igor lost 4 beakers."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a furniture assembly expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. Since each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws, we can multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table and then by the number of screws per leg.

Total screws needed = Number of tables x Number of legs per table x Number of screws per leg
= 4 x 4 x 2
= 32

Since James has 40 screws, we can subtract the total screws needed from the total screws he has to find the number of screws left over:

Screws left over = Total screws - Total screws needed
= 40 - 32
= 8

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's solve the problem together.

To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket (10) to the number of eggs in the second basket. Since the second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of eggs in the second basket = 2 x Number of eggs in the first basket
= 2 x 10
= 20

Now, let's add the number of eggs in both baskets:

Total number of eggs = Number of eggs in the first basket + Number of eggs in the second basket
= 10 + 20
= 30

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have four individuals: Alexandra, Kim, Maryam, and Sarah. We know the following information:

- Alexandra raised $430.
- Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
- Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
- Sarah raised $300.

To find the total amount of money raised, we need to add the amounts each person raised: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300.

Let's calculate the total: $430 + $750 = $1180, then $1180 + $700 = $1880, and finally $1880 + $300 = $2180.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a sports enthusiast and running coach. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Aaron and Vanessa were relay race partners, and Aaron ran twice as fast as Vanessa. We also know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, while Aaron ran 2 miles. 

Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can find his speed by dividing the time by the distance: 16 minutes ÷ 2 miles = 8 minutes per mile.

Now, we can find Vanessa's speed by multiplying Aaron's speed by 2, since Vanessa ran twice as fast as Aaron: 8 minutes per mile × 2 = 16 minutes per mile.

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can find the time it took her to complete her part of the race by multiplying her speed by the distance: 16 minutes per mile × 4 miles = 64 minutes.

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: 64"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a dock maintenance expert. To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we need to calculate the length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we can multiply the length of the dock by 3.

Total line required = 3 * 200
Total line required = 600 feet

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of line. To find the total amount of line he needs to buy, we subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required.

Total line to buy = Total line required - 6 feet
Total line to buy = 600 - 6
Total line to buy = 594 feet

The caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fruit vendor with extensive experience in the industry. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to calculate the cost per unit and then apply the profit margin.

First, let's find the cost per watermelon:

Total cost of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost per watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
= $80 / 50
= $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price with a 25% profit. To do this, we'll calculate 25% of the cost and add it to the cost.

Profit = 25% of $1.60
= 0.25 x $1.60
= $0.40

Selling price = Cost + Profit
= $1.60 + $0.40
= $2.00

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a family dynamics expert. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, his current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We also know that John had a son James when he was 19 years old. To find John's current age, we need to add the number of years that have passed since James was born. Since James is currently 18 years old, we can calculate the number of years that have passed as 18 - 19 = -1. However, this doesn't make sense in this context, so let's re-evaluate. We know that John is currently 37 years old (18 + 19), and James is 18 years old. This means that James was born when John was 19 years old. To find the number of years that have passed since James was born, we can subtract John's age at James' birth from John's current age: 37 - 19 = 18 years.

"Hello! I'm Yumi, a fruit expert with a focus on citrus fruits. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. We want to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour (60 minutes).

First, let's calculate the number of oranges each person peels in 60 minutes:

Ana peels oranges at a rate of 1/3 per minute. To find out how many oranges she peels in 60 minutes, we can multiply her rate by 60:

Ana peels 60 * (1/3) = 20 oranges

Jane peels oranges at a rate of 1/4 per minute. To find out how many oranges she peels in 60 minutes, we can multiply her rate by 60:

Jane peels 60 * (1/4) = 15 oranges

Now, let's find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:

20 (Ana's oranges) - 15 (Jane's oranges) = 5 oranges

Therefore, Ana will peel 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

The final answer is 5."
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a mechanic with 5 years of experience in car repairs. I'd be happy to help you with Mark's car problem.

To calculate the total cost of the new radiator, we need to first find the discounted price. Since Mark gets 80% off the original price of $400, we can calculate the discount as follows:

Discount = 80% of $400 = 0.8 * $400 = $320

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the cost of the radiator:

Cost of radiator = $400 - $320 = $80

Next, we need to calculate the labor cost for the mechanic. The labor cost is $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. So, the labor cost is:

Labor cost = 3 hours * $50 per hour = $150

Finally, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to get the total cost:

Total cost = $80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230

Therefore, Mark paid a total of $230 for the new radiator.

Final answer: $230"
"Hello there! I'm Yumi, a farm animal expert. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the total number of legs is 70, and we have two types of animals: chickens and cows. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs.

We can represent the number of chickens as 'x' and the number of cows as '20 - x'. Since we know the total number of animals is 20, we can set up an equation:

2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

To simplify the equation, we can start by distributing the 4:

2x + 80 - 4x = 70

Next, we can combine like terms:

-2x + 80 = 70

Now, let's isolate the variable 'x' by subtracting 80 from both sides:

-2x = -10

Finally, we can divide both sides by -2 to solve for 'x':

x = 5

So, there are 5 chickens.

The final answer is: 5"
"Hello! I'm Yumi, a food enthusiast and pizza connoisseur. When it comes to sharing pizzas, I always believe in dividing the slices fairly among the group.

To determine how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. Since there are 7 pizzas, each cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56.

Now, let's divide the total number of slices (56) by the number of people (4):

56 ÷ 4 = 14

So, each person can have 14 slices."
