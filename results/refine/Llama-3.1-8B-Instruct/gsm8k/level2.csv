"To determine Janet's daily earnings from selling eggs at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she has left after consuming some for breakfast and baking muffins.

Let's denote the number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks as E = 16. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for muffins, so the total number of eggs used is 3 + 4 = 7.

The number of eggs left can be calculated as E - 7 = 16 - 7 = 9.

Since Janet sells the remaining eggs at $2 per egg, her daily earnings can be calculated as 9 * 2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to consider the amount of blue and white fiber needed. The problem states that 2 bolts of blue fiber are required, and the amount of white fiber is half that amount.

Let's denote the amount of white fiber as W. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, we can express it as:

W = 2 / 2
W = 1

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together to find the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = 2 (blue) + 1 (white)
Total bolts = 3

Therefore, the total number of bolts required for the robe is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to determine the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh invested $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value, we can use the formula:

New value = Original value + (Original value * Percentage increase)
New value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

Now, we need to find the total cost of the house, which is the original price plus the repairs:
Total cost = Original value + Repairs
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

The profit is the difference between the new value and the total cost:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To determine the total distance James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. James runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters. To find the total meters he runs in one session, we multiply the number of sprints by the distance of each sprint:
   3 sprints/session × 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

2. Since James runs 3 times a week, we need to multiply the total meters he runs in one session by the number of sessions he has in a week:
   180 meters/session × 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters in a week.

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we must first calculate the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon. 

Let's denote the number of cups of feed given in the morning as M and the number of cups of feed given in the afternoon as A. We are given that M = 15 and A = 25. 

The total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon is M + A = 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

To find the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total cost of the glasses, we can use a geometric series formula. The first term (a) is $5, the common ratio (r) is 0.6, and the number of terms (n) is 16.

The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r).

Plugging in the values, we get S = $5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6).

First, we calculate 0.6^16:

"Given the problem, we can establish a straightforward arithmetic progression to determine the total number of sheep.

Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as S. We are given that S = 20.

Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so the number of sheep in Charleston is 4S = 4(20) = 80.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so the number of sheep in Toulouse is 2(4S) = 2(4(20)) = 160.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
Total = S + 4S + 2(4S) = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To determine the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break down the process into manageable parts. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, we can use the formula:

Time = (Percentage of file to be downloaded * Total file size) / Download rate

Time = (0.4 * 200 GB) / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Next, we need to account for the time it takes to install the updates, which is given as 20 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:

Time = (Percentage of file to be downloaded * Total file size) / Download rate
Time = (0.6 * 200 GB) / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

However, since Carla has to restart the download from the beginning after the updates are installed, we need to add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file again. This is because the download process starts over from the beginning.

Total time = Time to download first 40% + Time to install updates + Time to download remaining 60% + Time to download first 40% again
Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes + 40 minutes
Total time = 160 minutes

The final answer is: 160"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into segments and use the formula Distance = Speed * Time.

Let's denote the distance from John's home as D. 

1. Distance traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
D - x = 60 * 3
D - x = 180

2. Since John turns around, the distance from his current location to home is still D - x.

3. Distance traveled in the first 2 hours of the return trip in standstill traffic:
Distance = Speed * Time
0 = 0 * 2
0 = 0

4. Distance traveled in the next half-hour at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
D - x - 15 = 30 * 0.5
D - x - 15 = 15

5. Distance traveled in the remaining 2 hours of the return trip at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
D - x - 15 - 15 = 80 * 2
D - x - 30 = 160

Now we have a system of equations:
D - x = 180
D - x - 15 = 15
D - x - 30 = 160

We can solve for x by subtracting the second equation from the first:
(D - x) - (D - x - 15) = 180 - 15
0 + 15 = 165
15 = 165

This is incorrect, so let's try another approach. Subtracting the second equation from the third:
(D - x - 30) - (D - x - 15) = 160 - 15
-15 = 145

This is also incorrect. Let's try again. Subtracting the second equation from the first:
(D - x) - (D - x - 15) = 180 - 15
0 + 15 = 165

This is still incorrect. Let's try again. Subtracting the second equation from the third:
(D - x - 30) - (D - x - 15) = 160 - 15
-15 = 145

This is still incorrect. Let's try again. Subtracting the second equation from the first:
(D - x) - (D - x - 15) = 180 - 15
0 + 15 = 165

This is still incorrect. Let's try again. Subtracting the second equation from the third:
(D - x - 30) - (D - x - 15) = 160 - 15

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into two components: regular pay and overtime pay.

Her regular pay is calculated at a rate of $10 per hour for the first 40 hours worked. This can be expressed as:

Regular Pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, Eliza receives 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour. Since she worked a total of 45 hours, the number of overtime hours is 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Therefore, her overtime pay is:

Overtime Pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

To find her total earnings for the week, we add her regular pay and overtime pay:

Total Earnings = Regular Pay + Overtime Pay
= $400 + $60
= $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To calculate the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the program had 60 downloads in the first month.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, which is a straightforward multiplication problem: 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

Now, let's address the third month. The downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3: 0.3 * 180 = 54. 

To find the number of downloads in the third month, we subtract 54 from 180: 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To calculate the total cost of the pastries, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen donuts is equivalent to 3 * 12 = 36 donuts. The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. 2 dozen mini cupcakes is equivalent to 2 * 12 = 24 cupcakes. The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.

Lastly, we calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes. 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is equivalent to 6 * 12 = 72 cheesecakes. The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost of the pastries is $694."
"To determine the number of years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we can model this situation using a linear equation.

Let's denote the number of years as \( y \). The total cost of the tree is $90, and the annual maintenance cost is $3. The revenue generated each year is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year.

The net revenue each year is the revenue minus the maintenance cost: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year.

The total cost of the tree is the initial cost minus the net revenue multiplied by the number of years:

\[ 90 = 7.5y \]

To find the number of years, we need to solve for \( y \):

\[ y = \frac{90}{7.5} \]

\[ y = 12 \]

This means it will take 12 years for the tree to pay for itself. However, since the tree will start generating revenue in the first year, we can conclude that it will start earning money in the 1st year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Let x be the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had. We can represent the number of vacuum cleaners she sold at each house as follows:

- At the green house: x/3
- At the red house: 2
- At the orange house: (x - x/3 - 2)

We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2) = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - x/3 - 2 - x + x/3 - 2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 4 = 5

Add 4 to both sides:

x = 9

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 20% of the total number of students:
20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students

Now, we need to find the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25% of the remaining students:
25% of (20 - 4) students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance is also 4. So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

Therefore, the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the optimal investment choice, we need to calculate the expected increase in value for each option. 

Let's denote the initial price of the jewelry as J = $5,000 and the initial price of the electronic gadgets as G = $8,000. The expected increase in value for the jewelry is 2.5% of J, which can be expressed as:

ΔJ = 0.025J = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125

Similarly, the expected increase in value for the electronic gadgets is 1.2% of G:

ΔG = 0.012G = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the item with the higher expected increase in value. In this case, ΔJ = $125 is greater than ΔG = $96. Therefore, the merchant should invest in the jewelry.

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125.

The final answer is: $125"
"Given the scenario, we have two trains traveling in a two-dimensional plane, with one axis representing the westward direction and the other axis representing the northward direction. The trains travel 80 miles westward on the first day and 150 miles northward on the second day.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, the two sides are the distances traveled westward and northward.

Let's denote the distance traveled westward as a = 80 miles and the distance traveled northward as b = 150 miles. We can now apply the Pythagorean theorem:

c² = a² + b²
c² = 80² + 150²
c² = 6400 + 22500
c² = 28900
c = √28900
c = 170 miles

Therefore, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is 170 miles."
"To determine Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching. The formula for this is:

Annual earnings from teaching = Hourly wage * Hours worked per week * Weeks worked per year
= $20 * 35 * 50
= $20 * 35 * 50
= 20 * 35 * 50
= 35000

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching. The formula for this is:

Annual earnings from coaching = Hourly wage * Hours worked per week * Weeks worked per year
= $30 * 15 * 50
= 30 * 15 * 50
= 30 * 750
= 22500

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:

Total annual salary = Annual earnings from teaching + Annual earnings from coaching
= 35000 + 22500
= 57500

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she consumes in that time period. 

First, we calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 weeks by 7 days per week:

4 weeks × 7 days/week = 28 days

Next, we calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in 28 days. Since she eats 3 eggs per day, we multiply 28 days by 3 eggs/day:

28 days × 3 eggs/day = 84 eggs

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

84 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Marissa has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours. To find her current average speed, we can use the formula:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time

We can plug in the values we know:

Average speed = 6 miles / 2 hours
Average speed = 3 mph

Now, let's consider the entire 12-mile hike. Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 mph. We can use the formula:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time

We can plug in the values we know:

4 mph = 12 miles / Total time

To find the total time, we can multiply both sides by the total distance:

Total time = 12 miles * 4 mph
Total time = 48 hours

However, we know that Marissa has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles. To find the remaining time, we can subtract the time she has already spent from the total time:

Remaining time = Total time - Time spent
Remaining time = 48 hours - 2 hours
Remaining time = 46 hours

The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles. To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed = 6 miles / 46 hours
Speed = 6/46 mph

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

Speed = 3/23 mph

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{3}{23}}$"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink, then subtract the amount of water in the spilled 1 liter of orange drink.

First, let's find the amount of water in the orange drink. Since it is two-thirds water, we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{2}{3}$. To find the amount of water in 10 liters of the orange drink, we multiply this fraction by 10:

$$\frac{2}{3} \cdot 10 = \frac{20}{3}$$

To simplify this fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. However, we can also express this fraction as a decimal for easier calculation:

$$\frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67$$

Now, let's find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Since it is three-fifths water, we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{3}{5}$. To find the amount of water in 15 liters of the pineapple drink, we multiply this fraction by 15:

$$\frac{3}{5} \cdot 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9$$

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink. We add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink:

$$6.67 + 9 = 15.67$$

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to subtract the amount of water in this 1 liter from the total amount of water:

$$15.67 - 1 = 14.67$$

However, we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. Since the total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, and we have 14.67 liters of water, the remaining amount of non-water liquid is 24 - 14.67 = 9.33 liters.

To find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to find the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink and the pineapple drink. Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is (1/3) * 9.33 = 3.11 liters.
Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is (2/5) * 9.33 = 3.732 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.67 + 3.11 + 3.732 = 21.512 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21.51}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Raymond's son and then calculate the time elapsed since his birth.

First, we know that Samantha is 31 years old, and Raymond is 6 years younger than her. Therefore, Raymond's current age is 31 - 6 = 25 years.

We are also given that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find the age of the son, we need to subtract 23 from Raymond's current age: 25 - 23 = 2.

Since the son is 2 years younger than Raymond, we can conclude that the son is currently 2 years old.

Now, we need to find out how many years ago the son was born. Since the son is currently 2 years old, we subtract his age from the current year to find the year of his birth. However, the problem does not provide the current year, but we can still express the time elapsed since his birth as his current age, which is 2 years.

Therefore, the time elapsed since Raymond's son was born is 2 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers purchase 1 DVD each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 3 \* 1 = 3.

The next 2 customers purchase 2 DVDs each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 2 \* 2 = 4.

To find the total number of DVDs sold, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7.

Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"To determine the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns for 4 hours, from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The rate at which the candle melts is 2 centimeters per hour.

Let's denote the rate of melting as r = 2 cm/hour and the time as t = 4 hours. The total melting can be calculated using the formula:

Total melting = r * t
Total melting = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
Total melting = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since the book was sold with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so it is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

$$
\frac{0.75x}{0.75} = \frac{19.50}{0.75}
$$

$$
x = \frac{19.50}{0.75}
$$

$$
x = 26
$$

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of boxes of pizza as 'x'. The total cost of the items can be represented as the sum of the individual costs.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12, the cost of the milk is 5 packs * $3 = $15, and the cost of the apples is 4 apples * $1.50 = $6. The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

The total amount Marie paid is $50, and the cost of each box of pizza is $8.50. Therefore, the total cost of the pizza boxes can be represented as $8.50x.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: $33 + $8.50x = $50.

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting $33 from both sides of the equation:

$8.50x = $50 - $33
$8.50x = $17

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by $8.50 to solve for x:

x = $17 / $8.50
x = 2

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on clothing items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts: 3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 each is 3 × $16.50 = $49.50.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the pants: 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each is 3 × $22.50 = $67.50.

Lastly, we'll calculate the cost of the shoes: 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each is 3 × $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The total amount Mishka spent on clothing items is $243."
"To determine the total cost of ice cream for Cynthia, we need to calculate the number of cartons she will purchase and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia consumes one serving of ice cream per night, she will require 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (1 serving per night for 60 nights).

Each carton contains 15 servings, so to find the total number of cartons she needs, we divide 60 by 15:

$$\frac{60}{15} = 4$$

Therefore, Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream.

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

$$4 \times \$4.00 = \$16.00$$

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Let's denote the distance from the first stop to the second stop as x. Since Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, we can set up an equation to represent the total distance of the trip.

The distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 20 + x, and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip is 45 (60 - 15 = 45). Since the total trip distance is 60 miles, we can set up the following equation:

20 + x + 45 = 60

Combine like terms:

65 + x = 60

Subtract 65 from both sides:

x = -5

However, the distance cannot be negative, as it represents a physical distance. This indicates that the initial setup of the equation was incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The correct approach is to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop by subtracting the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. However, we can also find the distance from the first stop to the second stop by considering the total distance and the position of the second stop.

Since the second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip.

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 20 + (60 - 15)
Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 20 + 45
Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 65

However, this is not the correct approach. Let's consider the total distance and the position of the first stop.

The distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 20 miles, and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip is 45 miles. Since the second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the first stop to the second stop.

"Let's analyze the problem. We are given that Gloria has to choose between a pair of boots and two pairs of high heels. The two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots, and one pair of heels costs $33, while the other costs twice as much.

Let's denote the cost of the boots as B and the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as H. Since the more expensive pair of heels costs twice as much as the less expensive pair, we can express the cost of the more expensive pair as 2 * 33 = $66.

We can now set up an equation to represent the situation: B = 33 + 66 - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

Therefore, the cost of the boots is $94.

The final answer is: $94"
"Given the ratio of Darrell's and Allen's ages is 7:11, we can express their ages as 7x and 11x, respectively, where x is a common multiplier. The total of their ages is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms to simplify the equation:

18x = 162

To solve for x, divide both sides of the equation by 18:

x = 162 / 18
x = 9

Now that we have the value of x, we can determine Allen's current age by substituting x into the expression for his age:

Allen's age = 11x
= 11(9)
= 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10
= 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide by the number of people.

Let's start by finding the individual guesses. The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one: $\frac{80}{2} = 40$, so the second person guesses $40 + 20 = 60$ jelly beans.

The third person guesses 25% more than the first one: $80 \times 0.25 = 20$, so the third person guesses $80 + 20 = 100$ jelly beans.

Now, we need to find the total number of guesses: $80 + 60 + 100 = 240$.

There are 3 people, so to find the average guess, we divide the total number of guesses by the number of people: $\frac{240}{3} = 80$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to calculate the daily time spent and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

Given:
- Number of dogs: 10
- Time per dog: 0.5 hours

Daily time spent = Number of dogs * Time per dog
Daily time spent = 10 * 0.5
Daily time spent = 5 hours

Weekly time spent = Daily time spent * Number of days in a week
Weekly time spent = 5 * 7
Weekly time spent = 35 hours

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of dogs."
"Given that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, with 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can express the number of gold coins as G and the number of silver coins as S. The relationship between the two can be represented by the equation G = S + 30.

We also know that the total number of coins is 110, which can be expressed as the sum of the number of gold and silver coins: S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we obtain S + (S + 30) = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we combine like terms to get 2S + 30 = 110.

Next, we isolate the variable S by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation, yielding 2S = 80.

Dividing both sides by 2, we find that S = 40.

Now that we have determined the value of S, we can find the value of G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step using algebraic expressions.

Let R represent the number of jewels Raymond has, A represent the number of jewels Aaron has, and S represent the number of jewels Siobhan has.

Given that Raymond has 40 jewels, we can express this as:

R = 40

We are also given that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. This can be expressed as:

A = (1/2)R + 5

Substituting the value of R into the equation for A, we get:

A = (1/2)(40) + 5
A = 20 + 5
A = 25

Now, we are told that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. This can be expressed as:

S = A - 2

Substituting the value of A into the equation for S, we get:

S = 25 - 2
S = 23

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"To determine the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 4 × 0.25 = 1 point. Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total cost of yogurts Terry consumes over 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in that time frame.

Given that Terry eats 2 yogurts per day, the total number of yogurts consumed in 30 days can be calculated as follows:

2 yogurts/day × 30 days = 2 × 30 = 60 yogurts

Since the yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of yogurts by 4:

60 yogurts ÷ 4 yogurts/set = 15 sets

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of sets by the cost per set:

15 sets × $5.00/set = $75.00

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To determine the number of Lego sets John still has, we need to calculate the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money.

The total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets is the sum of the money he made from selling the sets with his own money and the sets with the money from the Lego sales:
15x + 15(13 - x) = 15x + 195 - 15x = 195

However, we know that he also made $35 from selling the Lego sets with his own money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
15x = 35

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 35 / 15
x = 2.33 (round down to 2 since you can't sell a fraction of a Lego set)

This means John sold 2 Lego sets with his own money. The number of Lego sets he sold with the money from the Lego sales is then 13 - 2 = 11.

Since he sold 11 Lego sets with the money from the Lego sales, he must have had 11 sets left to sell.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

Let's break down John's running schedule:

- Day 1: 3 hours
- Day 2 and Day 3: 1.5 hours each

Total running time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we need to multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time.
Total weekly running time = 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.
Speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 18 hours

To simplify the division, we can convert the hours to a decimal fraction of a week. There are 168 hours in a week, so we can express 18 hours as a fraction of 168 hours:
18 hours = 18/168 weeks

Now, we can rewrite the speed equation using this fraction:
Speed = 60 miles / (18/168) weeks

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:
Speed = 60 miles * (168/18) weeks^-1

Simplifying the expression, we get:
Speed = 960 miles / 18 weeks

Now, we can simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6:
Speed = 160 miles / 3 weeks

To express the speed in miles per hour, we can multiply the speed by the number of hours in a week (24 hours):
Speed = (160 miles / 3 weeks) * (24 hours / 1 week)

Simplifying the expression, we get:
Speed = 160 * 24 / 3 miles per hour
Speed = 1280 / 3 miles per hour
Speed = 426.67 miles per 168 hours
Speed = 2.53 miles per hour

However, we can simplify this further by converting the hours to a decimal fraction of a week:
Speed = 2.53 miles / (168/7) hours
Speed = 2.53 miles / 24 hours

Now, we can simplify the expression by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:
Speed = 2.53 miles / 24 hours

The final answer is: 2.53"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining variables for Dana's walking speed, running speed, and skipping speed. Let's denote her walking speed as $w$, her running speed as $r$, and her skipping speed as $s$.

We are given that her skipping speed is half of her running speed, so we can express this as $s = \frac{1}{2}r$. We are also given that her running speed is four times her walking speed, so we can express this as $r = 4w$.

We are given that her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour, so we can substitute this into the first equation to get $3 = \frac{1}{2}r$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = 6$ miles per hour.

Now that we know her running speed, we can find her walking speed by substituting $r = 6$ into the second equation: $6 = 4w$. Solving for $w$, we get $w = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5$ miles per hour.

Now that we know her walking and running speeds, we can find the distance she travels in six hours. Let's denote the time she spends walking as $t_w$ and the time she spends running as $t_r$. We are given that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, so we can express this as $t_r = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 6$ and $t_w = \frac{2}{3} \cdot 6$.

The distance she travels while walking is $d_w = w \cdot t_w = 1.5 \cdot 4 = 6$ miles, and the distance she travels while running is $d_r = r \cdot t_r = 6 \cdot 2 = 12$ miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is $d = d_w + d_r = 6 + 12 = 18$ miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a series of relationships between the ages of the iPhones.

Let's denote Suzy's iPhone age as S, Ben's iPhone age as B, and Brandon's iPhone age as Br.

From the information provided, we have the following equations:

1. S = 1 (Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old)
2. B = 2S (Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone)
3. Br = 4B (Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone)

Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get:
B = 2(1) = 2

Now, substituting the value of B into equation (3), we get:
Br = 4(2) = 8

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the increased range of the javelin when Polly holds the sapphire gemstone. The original range of the javelin is 400 feet, and when Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther.

Let's calculate the new range of the javelin:

New range = Original range × 3
New range = 400 × 3
New range = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, we need to find the distance outside the reach of the flames that Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the javelin. To do this, we subtract the range of the dragon's flames from the new range of the javelin:

Distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames = New range - Range of the dragon's flames
Distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames = 1200 - 1000
Distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames = 200 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of pieces of pie taken by the guests, we need to calculate the total number of pieces initially available and then subtract the number of pieces remaining.

The total number of pieces can be found by multiplying the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie: 5 pies * 8 pieces/pie = 40 pieces.

Now, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total: 40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces.

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the maximum amount of chips you can consume, we first need to calculate the remaining daily calorie allowance. Given that your daily calorie target is 2000 and you've already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories can be calculated as follows:

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (calories consumed) = 200 calories

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we can find the maximum number of servings you can consume by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per serving:

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Now, we know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings. To find the weight of chips you can consume, we can multiply the number of servings by the weight of the bag:

0.8 servings * 300g (weight of the bag) = 240g

Therefore, you can consume up to 240g of chips.

The final answer is: 240"
"To calculate Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles, we need to consider the cost of supplies and the revenue generated from selling the candles.

First, let's determine the cost of supplies for 20 candles. Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, 20 candles require 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost of supplies is:

Cost of supplies = 2 pounds * $10.00 per pound
Cost of supplies = $20.00

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

Therefore, Charlie's net profit from selling 20 candles is $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find this, we can multiply the number of articles written on Monday by 2/5 and add it to the original number of articles. This can be expressed as:

5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

To find the total number of articles written in 3 days, we add the number of articles written each day:

5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:

26 articles * 4 hours/article = 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x. We know that Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes, used 220 at work, and had 23 remaining. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes after purchasing the package is the sum of the initial Post-it notes, the Post-it notes used, and the Post-it notes remaining.

We can express this as an equation:

80 + x - 220 + 23 = Total Post-it notes after purchasing the package

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 23 = 80 + 220 - 23

Combine like terms:

x + 23 = 277 - 23

Subtract 23 from both sides:

x = 254

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 254.

The final answer is: $\boxed{254}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step using algebraic expressions.

Let's denote the number of blue ties as B and the number of red ties as R. We are given that R = 2B.

The cost of each blue tie is $40, and the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of a blue tie, which is $60.

We are also given that the total cost of blue ties is $200. This can be expressed as 40B = 200.

Solving for B, we get B = 200 / 40 = 5.

Now that we know the number of blue ties, we can find the number of red ties using the relationship R = 2B. Therefore, R = 2 * 5 = 10.

The total cost of red ties is 60R, and the total cost of blue ties is 40B. The total amount spent on ties is the sum of these two costs: 60R + 40B.

Substituting the values of R and B, we get 60(10) + 40(5) = 600 + 200 = 800.

Therefore, the total amount spent on ties is $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"When converting units, it's essential to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with different lengths. In this case, we have a piece of wire that's 4 feet long, and we need to cut it into pieces that are 6 inches long.

First, let's convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can multiply the number of feet by 12 to get the total length in inches:

4 feet × 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, to find the number of pieces Tracy can obtain, we need to divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

48 inches ÷ 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

Therefore, Tracy can obtain 8 pieces of wire, each 6 inches long.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of units in the building, we first calculate the product of the number of floors and the number of units per floor: $15 \times 8 = 120$ units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. To do this, we multiply the total number of units by 1/4: $120 \times \frac{1}{4} = 30$ units.

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To determine Lloyd's weekly earnings from egg sales, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then convert that to the number of dozens sold, as eggs are typically sold by the dozen.

First, we calculate the total number of eggs produced per week:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 147 \text{ dozen eggs/week} \]

Now, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find Lloyd's weekly earnings:
\[ 147 \text{ dozen eggs/week} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$294/\text{week} \]

The final answer is: $294"
"Given the scenario, we have a classic problem involving distance, rate, and time. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the time it took for Tom to travel from 1 to 4 PM. Since the distance is not explicitly given, we can assume it's a 3-hour journey, as the time elapsed is 3 hours. The distance traveled is then calculated using the formula:

Distance = Rate × Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, we need to find the time it took to travel back. The distance remains the same, 30 miles, and the rate is 6 miles per hour. Using the same formula:

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, the total time Tom spent traveling is the sum of the time it took to travel from 1 to 4 PM and the time it took to travel back:

Total Time = 3 hours + 5 hours
Total Time = 8 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removed and then determine how many toys he needs to remove to reach the desired weight reduction of 15 pounds.

First, let's find the total weight of the comic books. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and Uriah removed 30 comic books, we can calculate the total weight as follows:

Weight of comic books = 30 * (1/4) = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Now, we need to find the number of toys Uriah needs to remove to reach a total weight reduction of 15 pounds. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can set up the following equation:

Weight of toys to be removed = Total weight reduction - Weight of comic books
= 15 - 7.5
= 7.5 pounds

Now, we can divide the weight of the toys to be removed by the weight of each toy to find the number of toys:

Number of toys to be removed = Weight of toys to be removed / Weight of each toy
= 7.5 / 0.5
= 15

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys to reach the desired weight reduction of 15 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the revenue earned by the mechanic, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately for both Thursday and Friday.

Let's start by calculating the revenue from truck tires and car tires on Thursday. The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire.

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Next, we calculate the revenue from car tires on Friday since no truck tires were repaired.

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 * $40 = $480

Now, we compare the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday to find the day with higher revenue.

Thursday's revenue: $520
Friday's revenue: $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. To find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue.

Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

The final answer is: $40"

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck.

Weight limit of the bridge: 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck: 3755 pounds

Remaining weight capacity: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can find the maximum number of boxes by dividing the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box.

Maximum number of boxes: 1245 / 15 = 83

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

"To find the number of good oranges, we first need to determine the total number of unripe oranges. Since 20% of the oranges are unripe, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 25 oranges = (20/100) × 25 = 5 oranges

Now, we know there are 1 bad orange and 5 unripe oranges. To find the total number of oranges that are not good, we add these two quantities:

1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) = 6 oranges are not good

To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges:

25 (total) - 6 (not good) = 19 oranges are good

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then add 5% of that value.

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only gets the full pension for 10 years (30 - 20 = 10). For the remaining 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension.

The value of the pension after 10 years is 10 years * $50,000/year = $500,000.

For the remaining 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension, which is 0.05 * $500,000 = $25,000/year.

So, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000/year (for the first 10 years) + $25,000/year (for the remaining 20 years) = $75,000/year.

The final answer is: $75,000."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to consider the monthly charge and the discount applied to the second half of the year.

The monthly charge is $140. For the first half of the year, which consists of 6 months, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, a 10% discount is applied to the initial monthly charge. To find the discounted amount, we calculate 90% of $140, which is 0.9 * $140 = $126.

The monthly charge for the second half of the year is $126. For 6 months, Aleena paid 6 * $126 = $756.

To find the total amount paid, we add the amounts for the first and second halves of the year: $840 + $756 = $1596.

"To determine the distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

total miles = tank capacity * mpg
total miles = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total miles = 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"To determine the total time spent on TV and reading, we need to calculate the time spent in one week and then multiply it by 4.

Let's break it down:

Time spent watching TV in one day: 2 hours
Time spent reading in one day: 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour (since he reads for half as long as he watches TV)

Total time spent on TV and reading in one day: 2 + 1 = 3 hours

Since this pattern repeats 7 times a week, we can multiply the daily time by 7 to find the weekly time spent on TV and reading:

Time spent on TV and reading in one week: 3 hours * 7 days = 21 hours

Now, to find the total time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly time by 4:

Time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks: 21 hours * 4 = 84 hours

The final answer is: 84"

Therefore, the number of teachers is 36."
"Let's denote the initial amount of money Bailey starts with as x. We know that she receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total amount she receives from her allowance is 5 * 8 = $40.

We are given that at the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 40 = 100

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

So, Bailey started with $60.

To find the total number of instructions, we add the number of instructions in both recipes: 20 + 40 = 60.

Therefore, Kelian has to read 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes."
"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises from selling brownies and cheesecakes, we need to apply basic arithmetic operations.

First, we calculate the total revenue from the brownies: 43 brownies * $3 per brownie = $129.

Next, we calculate the total revenue from the cheesecakes: 23 cheesecakes * $4 per cheesecake = $92.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total revenue: $129 + $92 = $221.

The total amount of money Tommy raises is $221."
"To determine the monthly payment for Shiela's cell phone installment, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones, including the interest charged.

The original price of 5 cell phones is $150 each, so the total cost is 5 × $150 = $750.

The interest charged for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 × $150 = $3.

The total interest charged for 5 units is 5 × $3 = $15.

The total cost of the cell phones, including interest, is $750 + $15 = $765.

To find the monthly payment, we divide the total cost by the number of months: $765 ÷ 3 = $255.

Therefore, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

The final answer is: $255"
"To determine the total amount Artie will make, we need to round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar and then multiply the rounded price by the number of pots sold.

The prices of the flowers are: marigolds ($2.74), petunias ($1.87), and begonias ($2.12). Rounding these prices to the nearest dollar gives us: marigolds ($3), petunias ($2), and begonias ($2).

Now, let's calculate the total amount Artie will make from each type of flower:

Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

To find the total amount, we add the amounts together: $36 + $18 + $34 = $88.

The final answer is: $88"
"Given that each level of the sandcastle has half the square footage of the level below it, we can model this situation using a geometric sequence. A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.

In this case, the common ratio (r) is 1/2, since each level has half the square footage of the level below it. The first term (a) is 16, which is the square footage of the top level.

To find the total square footage of all levels, we can use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:

S_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S_n is the sum of the first n terms, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

Plugging in the values, we get:

S_4 = 16 * (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2)
= 16 * (1 - 1/16) / (1/2)
= 16 * (15/16) / (1/2)
= 16 * 15/16 * 2
= 15

Now, to find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

Average = S_4 / 4
= 15 / 4
= 3.75

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.75}$"
"To determine the total amount of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Given the problem, let's denote the amount of laundry David does as D, the amount Raymond does as R, and the amount Sarah does as S. We are given the following relationships:

1. R = (1/2)S
2. S = 4D

We are also given that S = 400 pounds of laundry. Substituting S = 400 into equation (2), we get:

400 = 4D

Solving for D, we get:

D = 400 / 4
D = 100

Now, we can find R using equation (1):

R = (1/2)S
R = (1/2)(400)
R = 200

Now, let's find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

Difference = R - D
= 200 - 100
= 100

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the better price for buying 18 flowers, we need to compare the cost per flower of each package. 

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $\frac{2.50}{3} = 0.8333$ dollars per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$ dollars per flower.

Since $0.5$ dollars per flower is less than $0.8333$ dollars per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
$\frac{18}{2} = 9$ packages of 2 flowers.
$9 \times 1 = 9$ dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers.
$\frac{18}{3} = 6$ packages of 3 flowers.
$6 \times 2.50 = 15$ dollars.

The difference in cost is $15 - 9 = 6$ dollars.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the original price.

The original price of the grooming is $100. To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 30% of this price.

Discount amount = 0.30 × $100
= 30% of $100
= (30/100) × $100
= $30

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the cost after the discount.

Cost after discount = Original price - Discount amount
= $100 - $30
= $70

Therefore, the cost of the grooming after the discount is $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To determine the amount of water left, we first need to calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls. Since each girl received 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate this as follows:

(1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water taken by the girls is 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Next, we need to account for the amount of water taken by the boy, which is 6 liters.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water taken by both the girls and the boy:
Total water taken = 8 (by girls) + 6 (by boy) = 14 liters

To find the amount of water left, we subtract the total water taken from the initial amount of water:
Water left = 24 - 14 = 10 liters

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the number of stickers Charlie has left, we need to apply basic arithmetic operations. Let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers. We can represent this as an initial value, denoted as $x = 10$.

He then purchased 21 stickers from a store, so we add this to the initial value: $x = 10 + 21 = 31$.

Next, he received 23 stickers for his birthday, so we add this to the current total: $x = 31 + 23 = 54$.

Now, we need to account for the stickers he gave away and used. He gave 9 stickers to his sister, so we subtract this from the current total: $x = 54 - 9 = 45$.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so we subtract this from the current total: $x = 45 - 28 = 17$.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times what Grace weighs and then subtract 2 pounds from that result. This can be expressed as:

4 × 125 = 500

Subtracting 2 pounds from this result yields:

500 - 2 = 498

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight:

125 + 498 = 623

Therefore, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds.

The final answer is: 623"
"To calculate the total number of thorns, we need to apply the fundamental principles of multiplication. 

Given:
- Number of rose bushes: 3
- Number of roses per bush: 25
- Number of thorns per rose: 8

We start by multiplying the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 × 25 = 75

Next, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 × 8 = 600

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Given that a football team played 22 games and won 8 more than they lost, we can express the number of games won as W and the number of games lost as L. The relationship between W and L can be represented by the equation W = L + 8.

We also know that the total number of games played is the sum of the games won and lost, which is given as 22. This can be expressed as W + L = 22.

To solve for W, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation: (L + 8) + L = 22.

Combining like terms, we get 2L + 8 = 22.

Subtracting 8 from both sides yields 2L = 14.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us L = 7.

Now that we have found L, we can determine W by substituting L into the equation W = L + 8: W = 7 + 8 = 15.

Therefore, the number of games the team won is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to calculate the total number of years he has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on per year.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34, so we can calculate the total number of years he has been vacationing as follows:

Total years = Current age - Age at the start of vacationing
Total years = 34 - 23
Total years = 11

Since Gene goes on 4 vacations per year, we can calculate the total number of quilt blocks as follows:

Total quilt blocks = Total years * Vacations per year
Total quilt blocks = 11 * 4
Total quilt blocks = 44

Therefore, Gene has a total of 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and add them up.

Let's denote the number of times the alarm rang the first time as $a = 4$. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so the number of times it rang is $3a = 3 \cdot 4 = 12$.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so the number of times it rang is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 12 = 6$.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up the number of times it rang each time: $a + 3a + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3a = 4 + 12 + 6 = 22$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the salary increase for each year. The company policy is to increase the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years.

The initial salary is $600. To calculate the salary after 5 years, we apply the 10% increase for 5 years. The formula for compound interest (or in this case, compound percentage increase) is:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal amount (initial salary), r is the annual increase rate (10% or 0.1), and n is the number of years.

A = $600(1 + 0.1)^5
A = $600(1.1)^5
A = $900

Now, we need to calculate the salary for the next 3 years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply the increase to the salary after 5 years.

The formula for compound percentage increase remains the same, but we will use the new principal amount ($900) and calculate for 3 more years.

A = $900(1 + 0.1)^3
A = $900(1.1)^3
A = $1089

To find the salary after 8 years, we apply the increase to the salary after 6 years.

A = $1089(1 + 0.1)^2
A = $1089(1.1)^2
A = $1198.09

To find the salary after 9 years, we apply the increase to the salary after 7 years.

A = $1198.09(1 + 0.1)
A = $1198.09(1.1)
A = $1317.899

The final numerical answer is: $1317.90"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. We can express this relationship as an equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

To solve for H, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11

H = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8000}$"
"To determine the total cost of gift bags, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will attend the party. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of guests.

Let's represent the total number of guests as 16. To find 1/4 of 16, we can multiply 16 by 1/4, which is equivalent to dividing 16 by 4.

16 - (16 ÷ 4) = 16 - 4 = 12

Now, we need to find the total number of gift bags needed. Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can multiply the number of guests by 0.75.

12 (guests) × 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

To find the total cost, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag, which is $2.

9 (gift bags) × $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"When it comes to solving word problems involving quantities and proportions, I always start by breaking down the information provided. In this case, we're dealing with a scenario where adult dinosaurs eat 10 pounds of potato salad and children eat half as much as adults.

Let's denote the number of adults as A and the number of children as C. We're given that A = 20 and C = 5. We know that children eat half as much as adults, so the amount of potato salad eaten by children can be expressed as (1/2) * 10 * C.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount eaten by adults and children separately and then add them together. The amount eaten by adults is 10 * A, and the amount eaten by children is (1/2) * 10 * C.

Substituting the given values, we get:

Amount eaten by adults = 10 * 20 = 200 pounds
Amount eaten by children = (1/2) * 10 * 5 = 25 pounds

Now, we add the amounts together to find the total amount of potato salad needed:

Total amount = 200 + 25 = 225 pounds

Therefore, Ted the T-Rex needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to ensure everyone has enough to eat.

The final answer is: 225"
"Let's analyze the given information algebraically. We can represent the number of pets each person has as variables. Let C be the number of pets Cindy has, M be the number of pets Marcia has, and J be the number of pets Jan has.

We are given the following relationships:

1. M = C + 2 (Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy)
2. J = 3M (Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia)
3. C = 4 (Cindy has 4 pets)

We can substitute the value of C into equation (1) to find M:
M = 4 + 2
M = 6

Now, we can substitute the value of M into equation (2) to find J:
J = 3(6)
J = 18

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has:
Total = C + M + J
Total = 4 + 6 + 18
Total = 28

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the ages of Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James as A, J, C, and J respectively.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. A = J + 5 (Amy is 5 years older than Jackson)
2. A = C - 2 (Amy is 2 years younger than Corey)
3. C = J + 1 (James is 1 year younger than Corey)
4. J = 10 (James is 10 years old)

We can substitute equation (4) into equation (3) to get C = 10 + 1 = 11.

Now, we can substitute C = 11 into equation (2) to get A = 11 - 2 = 9.

Finally, we can substitute A = 9 into equation (1) to get 9 = J + 5.

Solving for J, we get J = 9 - 5 = 4.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Gerald's original time. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can express Gerald's time as x, and Lee's time as x + 2. We are given that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation x + 2 = 38.

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
x = 38 - 2
x = 36

This means Gerald's original time is 36 seconds.

Now, we need to find Gerald's new time after his diet improvement. His speed increased by 10%, which is equivalent to 0.10 or 10/100. To find the time improvement, we multiply Gerald's original time by this percentage:
Time improvement = 0.10 * 36
Time improvement = 3.6 seconds

Since Gerald's speed improved, his new time will be his original time minus the time improvement:
New time = 36 - 3.6
New time = 32.4 seconds

The final answer is: 32.4"
"Let's analyze the given problem using algebraic notation.

Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of rabbits as R. We are given the following information:

1. R = D + C - 12
2. C = 2D
3. D = 60

Substituting the value of D into the second equation, we get C = 2(60) = 120.

Now, substitute the value of C into the first equation: R = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: Total = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168.

Simplifying the expression, we get Total = 348.

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to determine the total number of girls and then calculate the number of girls in the girl scout.

Given that 2/5 of the students are boys, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students.

Total students = 200
Boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Girls = Total students - Boys = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we need to find the number of girls in the girl scout. We are given that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find this number, we multiply the total number of girls by 2/3.

Girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Girls not in the girl scout = Total girls - Girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To determine the difference in hours slept between Harry and James, we first need to calculate the number of hours James slept. Since James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, we can express this as a fraction of Harry's total hours.

Let's denote Harry's hours as H. Then, James's hours can be represented as (2/3)H. Given that Harry slept 9 hours, we can substitute H with 9 to find James's hours:

(2/3)H = (2/3)(9)
= 6

Now, we need to find the difference between Harry's hours and James's hours. This can be calculated as:

H - (2/3)H
= 9 - 6
= 3

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"To determine the number of tomatoes used by Freda, we need to consider the volume of the sauce and the volume of the tomatoes before cooking. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be twice the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Given that each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can calculate the number of cans used by dividing the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can find the total number of tomatoes by multiplying the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Let's denote this number as 'x'. We know that a total of 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes.

Given that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway and 5 took an exit, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We can set up the equation: x + 20 = 25, where x represents the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"When analyzing the problem of the fog bank covering the city, we can apply the concept of proportional reasoning to determine the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

Given that the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes, we can establish a proportion to find the time it takes to cover 42 miles. The proportion can be set up as follows:

(3 miles) / 10 minutes = (42 miles) / x minutes

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3x = 42 * 10

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 3:

x = (42 * 10) / 3

x = 420 / 3

x = 140

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"Given that Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir eats, and Amir consumes 5 cookies, we can determine the number of cookies Cody eats by multiplying Amir's cookie consumption by 3.

Let's denote Amir's cookie consumption as A = 5. Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, we can express Cody's cookie consumption as C = 3A.

C = 3A
C = 3(5)
C = 15

Now, to find the total number of cookies they eat together, we add the number of cookies Amir eats and the number of cookies Cody eats.

Total cookies = A + C

"To find the inner volume of the boxes, we must first calculate the inner dimensions of each box. Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension to account for both the inner and outer walls.

The length of the box is 5 inches, so the inner length is 5 - 2 = 3 inches.

The width of the box is 6 inches, so the inner width is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.

The height of the box is 4 inches, so the inner height is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: $V = lwh = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24$ cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3: $V_{total} = 3 \times 24 = 72$ cubic inches.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time spent watching 30-minute episodes. 

Let's break down the time spent watching 1-hour episodes: 
- Monday and Tuesday: 2 * 1 = 2 hours
- Thursday: 1 hour
- Friday: 2 hours
Total time spent watching 1-hour episodes = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 hours

Now, let's find the total time spent watching TV: 7 hours

Time spent watching 30-minute episodes = Total time spent watching TV - Total time spent watching 1-hour episodes
= 7 - 5
= 2 hours

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes is:
2 / 0.5 = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, he bakes 2x cookies. However, he accidentally bakes 15 more cookies than intended, resulting in a total of 2x + 15 cookies.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This can be represented by the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards and then subtract the cashback rewards.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the cashback reward per gallon is $0.20. 

Total cost of gas without rewards = 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00
Total cashback rewards = 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost of gas without rewards:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each consumed and then find the mean.

Let's start by calculating the total number of roll-ups for each person. We can do this by multiplying the width by the length of each roll-up.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide × 24 roll-ups long = 2 × 24 = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide × 14 roll-ups long = 3 × 14 = 42 roll-ups

Now, we need to find the average number of roll-ups eaten by adding the total number of roll-ups eaten by each and dividing by 2.

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 ÷ 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To determine the amount of water the boat took on, we need to establish the rate at which the boat is taking on water and then apply it to the total distance rowed.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. We know that for every 10 feet rowed, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. Since it took 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the rate of rowing in feet per second: 

$$\frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}$$

Now, let's find the total distance rowed in 64 seconds:

$$\text{Distance} = \text{rate} \times \text{time} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet}$$

Since we are only interested in sets of 10 feet, we can divide the total distance by 10:

$$\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10} = 8 \text{ sets}$$

Since each set takes on 2 liters of water, we can multiply the number of sets by 2:

$$8 \text{ sets} \times 2 \text{ liters/set} = 16 \text{ liters}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"The problem at hand is a straightforward application of arithmetic operations. We have 4 teachers, each teaching 2 lessons per day, resulting in a total of 4 * 2 = 8 lessons per day.

Since each lesson involves the whiteboard being cleaned 3 times, we can calculate the total number of cleanings by multiplying the number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson: 8 * 3 = 24.

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted and subtract the ones that did not grow.

Let's denote the number of flowers Ryan plants per day as 'f' and the number of days as 'd'. In this case, f = 2 and d = 15.

The total number of flowers planted is given by the product of the number of flowers planted per day and the number of days: f * d = 2 * 15 = 30.

However, 5 of these flowers did not grow. To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to subtract the number of flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted: 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, the total number of flowers Ryan has is 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo as x. According to the problem statement, the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. Therefore, we can express the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as 50x.

We are also given that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up the following equation:

6(50x) = 1800

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

50x = 1800 / 6
50x = 300

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 50 to isolate x:

x = 300 / 50
x = 6

Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To calculate the profit from selling the leftover lumber, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 each = $100.
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 each = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have increased by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 each = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 each = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"When dealing with ratios and proportions, it's essential to understand the concept of equivalent ratios. In this case, we have a ratio of 7:13 for sugar to water. To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the fraction of the total mixture that is sugar.

The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20. The fraction of the mixture that is sugar is 7/20. To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar, we can multiply this fraction by the total amount of the mixture (120):

$$\frac{7}{20} \times 120 = \frac{7 \times 120}{20} = \frac{840}{20} = 42$$

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 42.

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"To determine the total cost of the shoes, we need to calculate the cost for all 3 children. 

First, we find the cost of the shoes for one child: 2 pairs * $60 = $120.

Then, we multiply this by the number of children: $120 * 3 = $360.

This is a straightforward arithmetic operation involving multiplication. The total cost is simply the product of the cost per child and the number of children.

The final answer is: $360"
"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to calculate the total number of vehicles that were already at the port on the first day and then find the difference between the total number of vehicles on the second day and the initial number.

The initial number of vehicles is 2 containers * 5 vehicles per container = 10 vehicles.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles imported on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4 containers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of percentage increase and how it applies to Adrien's and Lylah's salaries.

Let's start by determining Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Lylah's salary as 0.7x, where x is Adrien's salary. Given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, we can set up the equation:

0.7x = 0.7($40000)
x = $40000 / 0.7
x = $57142.86

Now that we know Lylah's salary four years ago, we can calculate her new salary after a 40% increase:

New Lylah's salary = 1.4($57142.86)
New Lylah's salary = $80000

Similarly, we can calculate Adrien's new salary after a 40% increase:

New Adrien's salary = 1.4($40000)
New Adrien's salary = $56000

To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries:

Total salary = New Adrien's salary + New Lylah's salary
Total salary = $56000 + $80000
Total salary = $136000

The final answer is: $136000"
"To determine the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month, we need to calculate the total sheets used in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad contains 30 sheets. Therefore, the total sheets used in a week can be calculated as follows:

2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 2 * 30 = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the total sheets used in a month by multiplying the weekly usage by 4:

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 60 * 4 = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"To determine the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Let's denote the number of apples Morisette brought as A and the number of oranges as O. We know that Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so A = 5 and O = 8.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so the number of apples Kael brought is 2A = 2(5) = 10.
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so the number of oranges Kael brought is O/2 = 8/2 = 4.

The total number of fruits Morisette brought is A + O = 5 + 8 = 13.
The total number of fruits Kael brought is 2A + O/2 = 10 + 4 = 14.

To find the total number of fruits they have in total, we add the number of fruits each person brought: 13 + 14 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To determine the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and add them up.

Let's break it down:

1. On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.
3. For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each day:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

To find the total hours, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Total hours = (n/2) × (a + l)

where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.

In this case, n = 7 (number of days), a = 8 (hours on Monday), and l = 7 (hours from Thursday to Sunday).

Total hours = (7/2) × (8 + 7)
= 3.5 × 15
= 52.5

The final answer is: 52.5"
"To determine the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she runs at two different speeds: 10 miles per hour for 3 hours and 5 miles per hour for the remaining time.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. We can use the formula Distance = Speed x Time.

Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 10 * 3
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours. The total time is 7 hours, and she has already run for 3 hours, so the remaining time is:

Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Next, we'll calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 5 * 4
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour to find the total distance:

Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand that Jennie stamps one-third of the letters needing stamps. Let's denote the total number of letters needing stamps as x. We know that she stamps 1/3 * x letters, which is equal to 20. This can be represented as:

(1/3)x = 20

To find the value of x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate x:

x = 20 * 3
x = 60

However, this is the total number of letters needing stamps. We are asked to find the number of letters in the already-stamped pile when Jennie began. We know that after stamping 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the already-stamped pile. Since Jennie stamped 20 letters, the number of letters in the already-stamped pile before she started is:

30 - 20 = 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

From the problem statement, we know that Julia initially had 'x' spoons. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, making the total number of spoons 'x + 5'. After using 3 spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. 

We can set up the equation: x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package Julia bought is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to calculate the sum of the chicken sausages and the fish sausages. 

Let's denote the number of chicken sausages as C and the number of fish sausages as F. We are given that C = 38 and F = C + 6.

We can substitute the value of C into the equation for F: F = 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we can find the total number of sausages by adding C and F: Total = C + F = 38 + 44.

Performing the addition, we get: Total = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to calculate the sum of their individual friend counts. 

Given that Lily has 50 friends, and Amy has 20 more friends than Lily, we can express Amy's friend count as 50 + 20 = 70.

Now, we can find the total number of friends by adding the number of friends Lily and Amy have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"Given the scenario, let's break down the problem using algebraic expressions to find the total amount of money Dillon will spend.

Let's denote the cost of a pepper as p, the cost of a watermelon as w, and the cost of an orange as o.

From the problem statement, we have the following relationships:

1. w = 3p (a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs)
2. o = w - 5 (an orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon)

We are given that the cost of each pepper is $15, so p = 15.

Substituting p = 15 into the first equation, we get w = 3(15) = 45.

Now, substituting w = 45 into the second equation, we get o = 45 - 5 = 40.

Dillon buys 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. The total cost can be expressed as:

Total Cost = (4w) + (20p) + (10o)
= (4 * 45) + (20 * 15) + (10 * 40)
= 180 + 300 + 400
= 880

Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To determine the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total revenue generated from the patients.

First, let's find the total time spent by doctors. We know the hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. 

Total time spent by doctors = Number of patients * Average time per patient
= 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient
= 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total minutes to hours.

Total time spent by doctors (in hours) = Total time spent by doctors (in minutes) / 60
= 12000 minutes / 60
= 200 hours

The total cost for the doctors is the number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly rate.

Total cost for doctors = Number of hours worked * Hourly rate
= 200 hours * $150/hour
= $30000

Now, let's find the total revenue generated from the patients. We know the hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, and the total time spent by doctors is 200 hours.

Total revenue = Number of patients * Average time per patient * Hourly rate charged to patients
= 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient * ($200/hour) / 60 minutes/hour
= 500 * 24 * $200 / 60
= 500 * 4 * $200
= 2000 * $200
= $400000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
= $400000 - $30000
= $370000

The final answer is: $370000"
"To determine the number of elves left, we need to apply a series of arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the number of elves that quit after being vomited on. This is one-third of the initial 60 elves, which can be expressed as:

60 / 3 = 20

Now, we subtract this number from the initial total to find the remaining elves:

60 - 20 = 40

Next, we need to account for the elves that quit after being kicked by children. This is a straightforward subtraction:

40 - 10 = 30

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30."
"To calculate the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June.

Let's denote the expenditure in May as M and the expenditure in June as J. We are given that J = M - 60.

We know that M = $500. Substituting this value into the equation for J, we get J = $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, we can find the total expenditure by adding M and J: Total expenditure = M + J = $500 + $440.

Performing the addition, we get Total expenditure = $940.

The final answer is: $940"
"To determine the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides each person took and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Let's start by calculating the total number of rides for each person. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Similarly, Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

Now, we need to find the total number of rides. To do this, we add the number of rides taken by Pam and Fred: 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, we can find the total number of tickets used by multiplying the total number of rides by the cost per ride: 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

Therefore, the total number of tickets used is 60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the miles walked on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total miles walked on Tuesday first. Since Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can express this as:

Miles walked on Tuesday = 6 × Miles walked on Monday
= 6 × 4
= 24 miles

Now, we know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. We can express this as an equation:

Miles walked on Monday + Miles walked on Tuesday + Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage
4 + 24 + Miles walked on Wednesday = 41

To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we can subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage - Miles walked on Monday - Miles walked on Tuesday
= 41 - 4 - 24
= 13 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the annual cost of car washes for Tom, we need to calculate the total cost of car washes per month and then multiply it by 12.

Given that Tom gets 4 car washes a month and each car wash costs $15, we can calculate the total monthly cost as follows:

Total monthly cost = Number of car washes per month × Cost per car wash
= 4 × $15
= $60

Now, to find the total annual cost, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12:

Total annual cost = Total monthly cost × 12
= $60 × 12
= $720

Therefore, the total annual cost of car washes for Tom is $720."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We are given that Brian has 20 video games initially but lost 5, so we need to find the number of video games he has after the loss. This can be represented as:

Brian's remaining video games = Initial video games - Number of games lost
= 20 - 5
= 15

Now, we are told that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. This can be represented as:

Bobby's video games = 3 × Brian's remaining video games - 5
= 3 × 15 - 5
= 45 - 5
= 40

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to calculate the proportion of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands and then find the proportion of females within that group.

First, we calculate the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 27$. 

$\frac{1}{3} \cdot 27 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{27}{1} = \frac{27}{3} = 9$

Now, we need to find the number of female Scottish unicorns. Two thirds of the unicorns in the Scottish Highlands are female, which can be expressed as $\frac{2}{3} \cdot 9$.

$\frac{2}{3} \cdot 9 = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{9}{1} = \frac{18}{3} = 6$

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

"To calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items:

- The cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each is 2 × $7.50 = $15.00.
- The cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each is 2 × $1.50 = $3.00.
- The cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each is 2 × $1.00 = $2.00.
- The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

Next, we need to calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost of the items. To find 20% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.20. Therefore, the delivery fee is 0.20 × $20.00 = $4.00.

Now, we add the delivery fee to the total cost of the items: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Finally, we add the tip of $5.00 to the total cost with the delivery fee: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

The final answer is: $29.00"
"Given that Mark took a test with 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour and had 8 hours to complete it, we can calculate the number of questions he completed as follows:

75 questions / 5 questions per hour = 15 hours to complete the test
However, Mark only had 8 hours, so we need to find the number of questions he completed in 8 hours:
8 hours * 5 questions per hour = 40 questions

For the second test with 100 questions at the same rate, Mark had 6 hours to complete it:
100 questions / 5 questions per hour = 20 hours to complete the test
However, Mark only had 6 hours, so we need to find the number of questions he completed in 6 hours:
6 hours * 5 questions per hour = 30 questions

Now, let's find the total number of questions Mark completed in both tests:
40 questions (first test) + 30 questions (second test) = 70 questions

To find the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we subtract the total questions completed from the total questions in both tests:
175 questions (total in both tests) - 70 questions (completed) = 105 questions

The final answer is: 105"

Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

In percentage terms, the semi-automatic cars constitute 20% of the total cars available for rent.

The final answer is: 20"
"Given the problem, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of worker bees (W), baby bees (B), and queens (Q). We are given that W = 2B and B = 2Q.

We can express the total number of bees as an equation: W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation to get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we have the value of Q, we can find the value of B by substituting Q into the equation B = 2Q, which gives us B = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the value of W by substituting B into the equation W = 2B, which gives us W = 2(200) = 400.

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Given that Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, if he spent his video game time working instead, he would work 2 hours more each day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

His hourly wage is $10, so the total amount of money he would earn in a week is 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To calculate the total cost of the items, we need to consider the tax on non-food items. The cost of food items is straightforward: milk for 2 dollars and eggs for 3 dollars, totaling 5 dollars.

For non-food items, we have light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars, totaling 10 dollars. Since there's a 10% tax on non-food items, we calculate the tax as a percentage of the total cost of non-food items: 10% of 10 dollars is 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar.

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine Kim's weekly profit, we need to calculate his total income and total expenses. 

Let's denote the number of clients as 'n'. Since Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, we can express the total number of clients as n = 8.

Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. Therefore, the total number of bottles of bleach needed per week is 2n, and the total number of packs of cloths needed per week is n.

The cost of bleach per week is 2n * $2 = $4n, and the cost of cloths per week is n * $5 = $5n.

Total expenses per week: $4n + $5n = $9n

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week: $92 - $9n

However, we know that n = 8. Substituting this value into the profit equation, we get:

Profit per week: $92 - $9(8) = $92 - $72 = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to consider the yield per hectare and the frequency of harvests.

First, let's establish the yield per hectare. We know that there are 100 pineapples per hectare. Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:

100 pineapples/hectare × 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Now, we need to calculate the number of harvests in a year. Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

To find the total number of pineapples harvested in a year, we multiply the yield per harvest by the number of harvests:

1000 pineapples/harvest × 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is 4000."
"To determine the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and add them together.

Let's start by identifying the number of pieces in each set. The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so it has 3 × 500 = 1500 pieces. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has 500 ÷ 4 = 125 pieces.

Now, we add the number of pieces in each set together: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

The total number of blocks Johnny picks up is 2125."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bees that leave the hive in the first 6 hours as $B_1 = 30$. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return, so the number of bees that return in the next 6 hours is $R_1 = \frac{1}{2}B_1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 30 = 15$.

The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is $B_1 + B_2$, where $B_2$ is the number of bees that leave the hive in the next 6 hours. We are given that $B_2 = 2B_1 = 2 \cdot 30 = 60$.

The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is $B_1 + B_2 = 30 + 60 = 90$. However, 15 bees have already returned, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is $90 - 15 = 75$.

In the next 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is equal to the number of bees that have not returned yet, which is 75.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of admission is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Since Brittany's mom purchased 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we can find the amount she gave the cashier by adding the total cost to the change:

Amount given = Total cost + Change
Amount given = $22 + $8
Amount given = $30

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"Given the problem, we can establish a relationship between the number of friends each person has on Facebook. Let's denote the number of friends Dorothy has as x. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can express this as:

Charlie's friends = 3x

We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 12

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 12 / 3
x = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find the number of friends James has, which is four times the number of friends Dorothy has:

James' friends = 4x
= 4(4)
= 16

Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Given the scenario, we have two individuals, Steve and Tim, competing to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives 3 miles away from the school and can bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school and can ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute.

First, let's convert the distances to a common unit. Since both speeds are given in feet per minute, we'll keep the distances in feet. Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is equivalent to 5280 feet (since 1 mile = 5280 feet). Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is equivalent to 10560 feet (since 1 mile = 5280 feet).

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 5280 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 12 minutes

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 12 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve
Difference in time = 40 - 12
Difference in time = 28 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"To determine the change Carl receives, we need to calculate the total cost of the cookies and subtract that from the $10 bill.

First, we find the total number of cookies: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies.

Next, we calculate the total cost: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill to find the change: $10 - $6 = $4.

Therefore, the change Carl receives is $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, applying logical reasoning and mathematical principles.

Let's denote the initial number of french fries as x.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially. The seagull then ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries. The total number of fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21.

2. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries. The total number of fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons is 21 + 9 = 30.

3. A raccoon then ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's denote the remaining fries after the pigeons ate as (x - 30). The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30). The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).

4. We can simplify the expression for the remaining fries after the raccoon ate: (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30) = (1/3)(x - 30).

5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5. We can solve for x by first adding 1 to both sides: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.

6. Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: x - 30 = 18.

7. Finally, add 30 to both sides to solve for x: x = 48.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

Let's break down Kimo's class schedule:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. This results in 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day for these days. Since there are 3 days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. This results in 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day for these days. Since there are 2 days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is the sum of the hours for both sets of days: 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes, we multiply the total hours per week by the number of weeks: 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{272}$"
"To determine the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 300 * 4 = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 120 * 6 = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 60 * 24 = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12:

3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we must calculate the monthly consumption of each ape species and then multiply it by 2 to account for the 2-month period.

The monkeys require 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons require 100 bananas per month. 

To find the total monthly consumption, we add these values together: 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas per month.

Since we want to know the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we multiply the monthly consumption by 2: 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine the winner of the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. This can be expressed as 2 * 100 * 15 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"

"To determine the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday, we need to calculate the depth of the water on Tuesday first. Given that the tank had 7 feet more water on Tuesday than on Monday, we can express this as an addition problem.

Let's denote the depth of the water on Monday as M. We are given that M = 17 feet. Therefore, the depth of the water on Tuesday is M + 7 = 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

Now, we need to find two thirds of the depth of the water on Tuesday. This can be calculated using the formula:

(2/3) × 24

To perform this calculation, we multiply 24 by 2 and then divide the result by 3.

(2/3) × 24 = (2 × 24) / 3
= 48 / 3
= 16

Therefore, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we need to calculate the number of fish each of them caught and then sum the results.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. The total number of fish caught by Anakin can be calculated as follows:

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish)
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3
Total fish caught by Anakin = 19

Now, let's calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. He also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which is 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Additionally, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish)
Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5
Total fish caught by Locsin = 13

To find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin, we add the number of fish caught by each of them:

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

"The problem at hand involves calculating the future value of a bag of marbles after a series of price increases, each of which is 20% of the current price. This is a classic example of exponential growth, where the growth rate is constant, but the growth is compounded over time.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where A is the future value, P is the initial value, r is the growth rate, and n is the number of periods.

In this case, the initial value (P) is $20, the growth rate (r) is 20% or 0.20, and the number of periods (n) is 36 months, divided by 2, since the price increases every 2 months. This gives us 18 periods.

However, since the price increases every 2 months, we can calculate the future value after 18 periods, and then multiply it by 2 to get the final value after 36 months.

A = $20(1 + 0.20)^18
A ≈ $20(3.320116922)
A ≈ $66.40333544

Now, we multiply this value by 2 to get the final value after 36 months:

A ≈ $66.40333544 × 2
A ≈ $132.80667088

Rounding to two decimal places, we get:

The final answer is: $132.81"
"To determine the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

Let's denote the cost of one action figure as 'a' and the cost of one red car as 'c'. We are given that the cost of one action figure is $5, so a = $5.

We are also given that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so the cost of the doll is 3a = 3 * $5 = $15.

The cost of one red car is given as $4, so c = $4.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of toy:
- 5 red cars: 5c = 5 * $4 = $20
- 3 action figures: 3a = 3 * $5 = $15
- 1 doll: 3a = $15

The total worth of all the toys is 5c + 3a + 3a = 5 * $4 + 3 * $5 + 3 * $5 = $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

"When considering whether to do her taxes herself or hire an accountant, Jackie must weigh the potential income loss from reduced freelance work against the cost of hiring a professional. 

To calculate the income loss from doing the taxes herself, we need to determine the number of hours she'll miss out on and multiply that by her hourly rate. In this case, she'll miss out on 3 hours of freelance work at $35 per hour. 

Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour
= $105

Now, let's compare this to the cost of hiring the accountant, which is $90. To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income she'll lose:

Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

The final answer is: $15"

"To determine the number of times Sandra must babysit to obtain the required eggs, we need to calculate the total number of eggs needed for the Spanish flans and then divide that by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job.

The total number of eggs required is 3 eggs per flan multiplied by the number of flans, which is 15. This can be expressed as 3 × 15 = 45 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job, which is 9. This can be expressed as 45 ÷ 9.

45 ÷ 9 = 5

Therefore, Sandra must babysit 5 times to obtain the required eggs."
"Let's analyze the given problem. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, which can be represented by the equation S = 2B, where S is Seth's age and B is Brooke's age.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be represented by the equation (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is a straightforward $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, which can be expressed as 3 × $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"Let's denote the age of Sally Two as $S_2$, the age of Granny Red as $G$, and the age of Sally Four as $S_4$. We are given that Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. Therefore, $S_4 = S_{32} = 8$.

We are also given that Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so $G = 2S_4 = 2(8) = 16$.

Furthermore, we know that Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so $S_2 = G + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19$.

To find the total age of the four birds, we can add their ages together: $S_2 + G + S_4 + S_{32} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51$.

The time to peel one potato is 1.5 minutes. To convert the time to cut one potato from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60, since there are 60 seconds in a minute.

Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes = 1/12 minutes

Now, we can calculate the total time to peel and cut all potatoes:

Total time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (1/12) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

To find the total time, we add the time to peel and cut all potatoes:

Total time to peel and cut all potatoes = 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{95}$"
"Given the scenario, let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of gallons as \(g\). The revenue per gallon is $10, and the cost per gallon is $5 (lemons and sugar combined). The profit is $25.

We can set up the equation based on the given information:

\[ \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = \text{Profit} \]
\[ 10g - 5g = 25 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 5g = 25 \]

Now, we can solve for \(g\):

\[ g = \frac{25}{5} \]
\[ g = 5 \]

Since the cost of lemons per gallon is $3, and the total cost of lemons is the cost of lemons per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons, we can find the total cost of lemons:

\[ \text{Total cost of lemons} = 3g \]
\[ \text{Total cost of lemons} = 3(5) \]
\[ \text{Total cost of lemons} = 15 \]

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to calculate the total number of Chinese participants. Given that there are 240 participants in total and 80 of them are Japanese, we can find the number of Chinese participants by subtracting the number of Japanese participants from the total.

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the amount of money Zaid has left after his expenses and donations, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, let's calculate the amount spent on rent: $\frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500$.

Next, we calculate the amount spent on car fuel: $\frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000$.

Now, we subtract these amounts from Zaid's monthly income to find the remaining amount: $6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500$.

Then, we calculate the amount donated to charity: $\frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250$.

After the donation, the remaining amount is: $2500 - 1250 = 1250$.

Next, we subtract the total amount given to his daughter and wife: $200 + 700 = 900$.

Finally, we calculate the amount Zaid has left: $1250 - 900 = 350$.

The final answer is: $350"
"Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as B, the number of crabs Monic has as M, and the number of crabs Rani has as R. We are given that B = 40, M = B - 4, and R = M + 10.

We can express M in terms of B as M = 40 - 4 = 36. Then, we can express R in terms of B as R = 36 + 10 = 46.

To find the total number of crabs, we add the number of crabs each person has: B + M + R = 40 + 36 + 46.

Using the commutative and associative properties of addition, we can rewrite the expression as (40 + 36 + 46).

Now, we can evaluate the expression by adding the numbers: 40 + 36 + 46 = 122.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"To determine Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then sum them.

Let's denote Lloyd's hourly wage as $10 and the number of hours tutored in the first week as 5, and the number of hours tutored in the second week as 8.

For the first week, Lloyd's earnings can be calculated as:
5 hours × $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd's earnings can be calculated as:
8 hours × $10/hour = $80

Now, we add his earnings for the first and second weeks together:
$50 + $80 = $130

Therefore, Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks are $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner obtained. Since the winner secured 3/4 of the total votes, we can express this as a fraction: 3/4 * 80.

To find the product of 3/4 and 80, we multiply the numerator (3) by 80 and then divide by the denominator (4). This can be represented as:

(3 * 80) / 4

First, we multiply 3 by 80:
3 * 80 = 240

Then, we divide the product by 4:
240 / 4 = 60

So, the winner received 60 votes. To find the number of votes the loser received, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes:
80 - 60 = 20

Therefore, the loser received 20 votes.

The final answer is: 20"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a relationship between the number of white carnations, pink calla lilies, and red roses. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. We are told that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and there are 200 pink calla lilies. This can be represented as:

5x = 200

To find the value of 'x', we can solve for it by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

$$
\frac{5x}{5} = \frac{200}{5}
$$

$$
x = 40
$$

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We are told that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. This can be represented as:

y = 4x

Substituting the value of 'x' we found earlier:

$$
y = 4(40)
$$

$$
y = 160
$$

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"Let's analyze the given information:

Let J represent Jean's current age, and M represent Mark's current age.

From the first statement, we have:
J = M + 2

The second statement can be translated into an equation as follows:
M - 2 = (1/2)(J - 2) + 5

Since we know Jan is 30, we can substitute J = 30 into the equation:
M - 2 = (1/2)(30 - 2) + 5
M - 2 = (1/2)(28) + 5
M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19
M = 21

Now that we have Mark's age, we can find Jean's age using the first equation:
J = M + 2
J = 21 + 2
J = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"Given the scenario of a 4x400 meter relay, where each team consists of four members, we can calculate the total time for each team by summing the individual times for each runner.

For the well-rounded team, each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Therefore, their total time is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the second runner runs 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner runs 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner runs 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

To find the difference in time between the two teams, we subtract the less well-rounded team's time from the well-rounded team's time: 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"The problem at hand involves comparing the probabilities of two distinct events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row. To begin, let's define the sample space for a six-sided die, which consists of the numbers 1 through 6.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 can be calculated by counting the favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) and dividing by the total number of outcomes. This yields a probability of $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$ or 50%.

Next, we'll determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. Since the die has 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6), the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$. As these events are independent, we multiply the probabilities to obtain the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4}$ or 25%.

Now, we'll find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row. This is given by $50\% - 25\% = 25\%$.

Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Given that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, and her mother picked 20 apples, we can determine the number of apples Jenna picked by dividing the number of apples her mother picked by 2.

20 ÷ 2 = 10

Therefore, Jenna picked 10 apples. To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mother picked.

10 + 20 = 30

The total number of apples they both picked is 30."
"Given that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. The total number of rats in 3 cages is then 3r.

We are also given that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, and the rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw. The total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50, and the total number of straw pieces given to the rabbits is 20.

Let's denote the total number of straw pieces given to the small rodents as 'S'. We know that S = 160. The total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70. Therefore, the number of straw pieces given to the rats is S - 70 = 160 - 70 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15. Since the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r, we can set up the equation 3r = 15. Solving for 'r', we get r = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount owed is $100.
The monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $100 + $2 = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $102 + $2.04 = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. The total cost of buying the bags is $20x, and the total cost of transporting the bags is $2x. Therefore, the total cost is $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. We can set up the equation:

$$30x - 22x = 400$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$8x = 400$$

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

$$x = \frac{400}{8}$$

$$x = 50$$

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3 to find out how much each friend paid.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets, food, and rides. The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the tickets, so it's $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75. The cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since they split the cost evenly, each friend paid $102 / 3 = $34.

Therefore, each friend paid $34.

The final answer is $34."
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the product of the peaches collected per minute and the total minutes spent collecting.

John collects 2 peaches per minute. 
He collects for 3 hours. 
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we multiply the number of peaches per minute by the total minutes:

2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches

Therefore, the total number of peaches John collects is 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"To determine the daily insect consumption of a flock of ten ducks, we first need to calculate their weekly consumption. Given that each duck requires 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we can find the total weekly consumption by multiplying the individual consumption by the number of ducks.

Weekly consumption = 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds

Now, to find the daily consumption, we divide the total weekly consumption by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

Daily consumption = 35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds/day

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks requires 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years and then subtract the trees that die.

First, let's calculate the net change in trees per year. Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

Tom starts with 50 trees, so after 10 years, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 × 0.3 = 39.

Now, we subtract the trees that die from the total number of trees: 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"To determine the difference between the number of pink and white plastic flamingos, let's break down the events step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is $\frac{18}{3} = 6$ flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and $18 - 6 = 12$ pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now $12 + 18 = 30$.

The total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: $30 - 6 = 24$.

"To determine the change Violetta will receive after purchasing the crayons, we need to calculate the total cost of the crayons and subtract it from the amount of money she has.

First, let's find the total cost of the crayons. Since Violetta needs 5 different colors and each color will have 2 crayons, the total number of crayons she needs is 5 * 2 = 10.

The cost of one crayon is $2. Therefore, the total cost of the crayons is 10 * $2 = $20.

Now, let's calculate the change Violetta will receive. We subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has: $20 - $20 = $0.

The final answer is: $0"
"To determine the cost of 8 pens, we first need to establish the cost of a single pen. Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, we can calculate this by adding the cost of a pencil and an eraser.

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we can calculate the cost of 8 pens by multiplying the cost of a single pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8 = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

"To determine the amount of carrots not used, we need to calculate the total pounds of carrots distributed and subtract that from the initial amount.

The number of restaurants is given as 40, and each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. We can calculate the total pounds of carrots distributed by multiplying the number of restaurants by the pounds each restaurant receives:

Total pounds of carrots distributed = 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds distributed from the initial amount to find the pounds not used:

Initial amount = 200 pounds
Total pounds distributed = 80 pounds
Pounds not used = Initial amount - Total pounds distributed = 200 - 80 = 120 pounds

P = 23786
M = 8417
W = 9092

We can calculate the number of children using the formula:

C = P - (M + W)

Substituting the given values, we get:

C = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
C = 23786 - 17509
C = 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. Let's start by identifying the initial number of Pokémon cards Elaine had: 20.

In the first month, Elaine collected three times the initial number of cards: 3 × 20 = 60.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40.

Now, let's calculate the combined number of cards collected in the first and second months: 60 + 40 = 100.

In the third month, Elaine collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: 2 × 100 = 200.

To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to add the cards from each month and the initial number: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Given that Mark edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, we can denote the number of sentences he edits for each publisher as x. Therefore, x = 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount he makes from Publisher A is 5x = 5 * 500 = 2500 cents.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, the total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 10x = 10 * 500 = 5000 cents.

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amounts from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

"To determine the total amount John made that year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then multiply it by the number of weeks he worked.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise. To find 5% of 2000, we multiply 2000 by 0.05:

$$
\begin{aligned}
5\% \text{ of } 2000 &= 0.05 \times 2000 \\
&= 100

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices of cheese Carl used throughout the week. Let's break it down into manageable parts.

First, we'll calculate the total number of slices used for sandwiches. Since Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days and used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, we can express this as:

Total slices for sandwiches = Number of days × Slices per sandwich
= 7 × 2
= 14

Next, we'll calculate the total number of slices used for omelets. Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. Therefore, the total number of slices used for omelets is:

Total slices for omelets = Number of days × Slices per omelet
= 3 × 3
= 9

Now, let's consider the macaroni and cheese dish. Carl used 8 slices of cheese in this dish.

To find the total number of slices used, we simply add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish:

Total slices = Total slices for sandwiches + Total slices for omelets + Slices for macaroni and cheese
= 14 + 9 + 8
= 31

"To determine the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of blue and red pens she purchased and add them to her initial number of pens.

Let's start by calculating the total number of blue pens she bought. Since she purchased 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, we can express this as a multiplication problem: 6 × 9 = 54 blue pens.

Similarly, we can calculate the total number of red pens she bought by multiplying the number of bags by the number of pens in each bag: 2 × 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, we add the number of blue and red pens she bought to find the total number of new pens: 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66 pens.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens she bought: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98 pens.

The final numerical answer is: 98"
"To determine the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we must first calculate the total score required for the semester. Since there are six tests and she desires an average of 93, we can find the total score needed by multiplying the desired average by the number of tests.

Total score needed = 93 * 6 = 558

Next, we need to find the total score of the first five tests. We add up the scores of the first five tests.

Total score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score of the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score of the remaining four tests, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests.

Total score of remaining four tests = 338 - 71 = 267

Now, we can find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test by subtracting the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score needed.

Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 267 = 291

"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we must first calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples, then sum these values.

The weight of the chocolate bars is given by the product of the number of chocolate bars and the weight of each bar: 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g.

The weight of the candied apples is then given by the product of the number of candied apples and the weight of each apple: 80 * 20g = 1600g.

The total weight of the bag of candy is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"Let's denote the cost of each cup as $c. We are given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is sold at $6000 each. 

The total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000. Therefore, we can express the cost of twenty dozen cups as $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups. We can now set up the equation to find the cost of each cup:

20 * 12 * c = 34,800

Simplifying the equation, we get:

240c = 34,800

To find the cost of each cup, we divide both sides of the equation by 240:

c = 34,800 / 240

c = 145

Therefore, the cost of each cup is $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"To determine the number of times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to earn and subtract the amount she already has.

Let's denote the number of times Sara must mow the lawn as 'x'. The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 + 2 * $20 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

The total amount she earns from babysitting is $5 * 4 = $20. The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is $70 - $10 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can set up the equation 4x = 40 to represent the situation.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 40 / 4.

x = 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a system of linear equations to solve for the number of red chickens. Let R represent the number of red chickens and W represent the number of white chickens. We are given that W = R + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is 42, with red chickens producing 3 eggs each and white chickens producing 5 eggs each. This can be represented by the equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

Therefore, the number of red chickens is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"The perimeter of a rectangle is a fundamental concept in geometry, and it can be calculated using the formula P = 2(l + w), where l represents the length and w represents the width. In this scenario, the length of the park is given as 6 miles, and the width is 1.5 miles.

To find the perimeter, we substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(l + w)
P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now that we have the perimeter, we can determine the time Gary spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed. Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the edge of the park.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can use a simple arithmetic approach. Let's break down the information given:

Day 1: 100 customers
Day 2: 50 more customers than Day 1, so 100 + 50 = 150 customers
Total by Day 3: 500 customers

We can calculate the number of customers on Day 3 by subtracting the total customers on Day 1 and Day 2 from the total by Day 3.

Customers on Day 3 = Total by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - (100 + 150)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - 250
Customers on Day 3 = 250

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago is 2x gallons.

The rate at which the water is leaking from both pools is 4 gallons/minute. Since 4 minutes have passed, the total amount of water leaked from both pools is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

The amount of water in the small pool now is x - 4 gallons (since 4 gallons leaked out). The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 4 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-4 = 2x - 16

Adding 16 to both sides:

12 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

6 = x

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. The amount of water in the small pool now is 6 - 4 = 2 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of hours Lori needs to work, we must first calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the belt.

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Next, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to purchase the shoes and the belt."
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay in monthly installments and then subtract that from the initial amount borrowed plus the additional 10% interest.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months:

$$\text{Total Amount Paid} = \text{Monthly Payment} \times \text{Number of Months}$$

$$\text{Total Amount Paid} = \$165 \times 12$$

$$\text{Total Amount Paid} = \$1980$$

Next, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay including the additional 10% interest:

$$\text{Total Amount to be Paid} = \text{Initial Amount Borrowed} + (\text{Initial Amount Borrowed} \times 0.10)$$

$$\text{Total Amount to be Paid} = \$2000 + (\$2000 \times 0.10)$$

$$\text{Total Amount to be Paid} = \$2000 + \$200$$

$$\text{Total Amount to be Paid} = \$2200$$

Now, let's calculate the remaining balance:

$$\text{Remaining Balance} = \text{Total Amount to be Paid} - \text{Total Amount Paid}$$

$$\text{Remaining Balance} = \$2200 - \$1980$$

$$\text{Remaining Balance} = \$220$$

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses.

Given that there are 4 roses in the vase, and there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can express the number of dahlias as 4 + 7 = 11.

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"Given that Harriet's age is 21 years, we can establish the following relationships:

Let H = Harriet's age
Let Z = Zack's age
Let A = Adrian's age

We are given that H = 21 and H = Z/2 and A = 3H.

Substituting the given values, we have:
H = 21
Z = 2H = 2(21) = 42
A = 3H = 3(21) = 63

Now, we need to find the average age of the three in three years. To do this, we first find their ages in three years:
H' = H + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24
Z' = Z + 3 = 42 + 3 = 45
A' = A + 3 = 63 + 3 = 66

The average age is given by (H' + Z' + A')/3 = (24 + 45 + 66)/3 = 135/3 = 45

"To determine the number of points Jojo scored, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the points scored by Jojo as $J$, Naomi as $N$, Yuri as $Y$, and Brianna as $B$. We are given the following information:

1. $N = 68$
2. $Y = \frac{1}{2}N + 10$
3. $B = N + 17$
4. $N + Y + B + J = 251$

We can substitute the expressions for $Y$ and $B$ from equations (2) and (3) into equation (4):

$N + \left(\frac{1}{2}N + 10\right) + \left(N + 17\right) + J = 251$

Combine like terms:

$3N + 27 + J = 251$

Subtract 27 from both sides:

$3N + J = 224$

Subtract $3N$ from both sides:

$J = 224 - 3N$

Substitute the value of $N$ from equation (1):

$J = 224 - 3(68)$

$J = 224 - 204$

$J = 20$

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total time spent on these puzzles, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles separately and then add them together.

The time spent on crossword puzzles can be calculated as the product of the number of puzzles and the time per puzzle: 3 puzzles * 10 minutes/puzzle = 3 × 10 = 30 minutes.

Similarly, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is the product of the number of puzzles and the time per puzzle: 8 puzzles * 5 minutes/puzzle = 8 × 5 = 40 minutes.

To find the total time spent, we add the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles: 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 30 + 40 = 70 minutes.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the amount of water in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we first subtract the amount used from the initial volume.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

This leaves 30 liters of water in the tank. Since Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, we can express this as a multiplication of the remaining water by 2.

2 × 30 = 60 liters

The collected rainwater is 60 liters. To find the total amount of water in the tank now, we add the remaining water and the collected rainwater.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers, we need to calculate the number of petunias first. Since Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we can express this as:

Petunias = Geraniums - 40

Given that the number of geraniums is 90, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Petunias = 90 - 40
Petunias = 50

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias:

Total flowers = Geraniums + Petunias
Total flowers = 90 + 50
Total flowers = 140

The final answer is: 140"

"To determine the probability of selecting a water type card from James' collection, we need to calculate the proportion of water type cards to the total number of cards.

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards, totaling 90 cards.

After losing 8 water type cards, the number of water type cards becomes 40 - 8 = 32, and the total number of cards becomes 90 - 8 = 82.

Following this, James acquires 14 grass type cards, increasing the total number of cards to 82 + 14 = 96 and the number of grass type cards to 20 + 14 = 34.

Now, we can calculate the probability of selecting a water type card:

P(Water) = (Number of water type cards) / (Total number of cards)
= 32 / 96

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

P(Water) = (32 / 96) * 100
= 33.333...%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the probability of selecting a water type card is 33%.

"To determine the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two months. To do this, we apply the 30% percentage to the initial 120 watermelons.

30% of 120 = 0.3 × 120 = 36 watermelons.

Now, we need to find the number of watermelons remaining after two months. This is simply the initial number of watermelons minus the number ready for harvest:

120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Next, we calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks. We are given that 3/4 of the remaining melons are ready for harvest. To find this, we multiply the remaining watermelons by 3/4.

3/4 × 84 = 0.75 × 84 = 63 watermelons.

Finally, we calculate the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks by subtracting the number ready for harvest from the remaining watermelons:

84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we must first calculate the total number of tomatoes consumed by Steve and his girlfriend per week. 

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, and his girlfriend eats half that amount, which is 3 tomatoes per day. To find the total number of tomatoes they eat per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7.

Steve's weekly consumption: 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week
Girlfriend's weekly consumption: 3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is the sum of their individual consumptions: 42 tomatoes/week + 21 tomatoes/week = 63 tomatoes/week

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine to find the number of vines needed: 
63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we must first calculate the total number of slices required to ensure each of the 20 friends receives 4 slices. This can be done by multiplying the number of friends by the number of slices per friend.

Total number of friends: 20
Number of slices per friend: 4
Total number of slices required: 20 × 4 = 80

Since pizzas are sold in slices of 8, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza to find the minimum number of pizzas needed.

Number of slices per pizza: 8
Number of pizzas required: 80 ÷ 8 = 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends receives 4 slices."
"To determine the total number of pens Ram gets, we need to calculate the number of new pens he can make from the ink of the 25 pens he buys.

Let's break this down step by step. Ram can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens. This means that for every 5 pens, he gets 1 new pen. 

We can represent this as a ratio: 5 pens : 1 new pen. To find the total number of new pens he can make from 25 pens, we can divide 25 by 5.

25 ÷ 5 = 5

So, Ram can make 5 new pens from the ink of the first 25 pens. Now, he has 5 empty pens left. He can use the ink from these 5 pens to make 1 new pen.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pens he gets: 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens from the first 25 pens) + 1 (new pen from the 5 empty pens) = 31 pens.

"When it comes to financial calculations, I always emphasize the importance of precision and accuracy. In this scenario, Johnny starts with an initial investment of $20, which he then adds an extra $10 to, resulting in a total of $30.

To determine the final amount after a year, we need to consider the concept of compounding, which is a fundamental principle in finance. In this case, the $30 triples in value, indicating a 200% increase. To calculate the final amount, we can use the formula:

Final Amount = Initial Amount + (Initial Amount x Rate of Return)

In this case, the rate of return is 200% or 2. We can express this as a decimal by dividing by 100: 2/100 = 0.02.

Now, let's apply the formula:

Final Amount = $30 + ($30 x 0.02)
Final Amount = $30 + $0.60
Final Amount = $30.60

However, since the problem states that the $30 triples, we can also calculate the final amount by multiplying the initial amount by 3:

Final Amount = $30 x 3
Final Amount = $90

Both methods yield the same result, confirming the accuracy of our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: $90"
"Given the problem, we can represent the ages of the three girls using variables. Let's denote Jessa's age as $J$, Joan's age as $J + 5$, and Mary's age as $J + 5 - 2 = J + 3$. We are given that Jessa is 20 years old, so we can substitute $J = 20$ into the expressions for Joan's and Mary's ages.

Joan's age is $J + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25$ years old.
Mary's age is $J + 3 = 20 + 3 = 23$ years old.

To find the sum of their ages, we add the individual ages together: $J + (J + 5) + (J + 3) = 3J + 8$. Substituting $J = 20$ into this expression, we get $3(20) + 8 = 60 + 8 = 68$.

"To determine the number of students who exited through exit C, we need to calculate the number of students who exited through exits A and B first.

30% of the students exited through exit A. To find this number, we multiply 1000 by 0.3 (which is equivalent to 30%):
1000 * 0.3 = 300 students exited through exit A.

Now, we need to find the number of students who exited through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students exited through exit B, we first need to find the remaining students after exit A:
1000 - 300 = 700 students remaining.

To find 3/5 of 700, we multiply 700 by 3/5:
700 * (3/5) = 700 * 3 / 5 = 420 students exited through exit B.

Now, we need to find the number of students who exited through exit C. This is the remaining number of students after exits A and B:
700 - 420 = 280 students exited through exit C.

"Given the problem, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of candies James, Robert, and John have. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as R, James has as J, and John has as H.

We are given the following information:

1. H = 2R (John has twice as many candies as Robert)
2. J = R + 6 (James has 6 more candies than Robert)
3. H = 54 (John has 54 candies)

Substituting the value of H from equation 1 into equation 3, we get 2R = 54. Solving for R, we find R = 54 / 2 = 27.

Now that we have the value of R, we can find the value of J by substituting R into equation 2: J = 27 + 6 = 33.

To find the difference in the number of candies between John and James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has: H - J = 54 - 33 = 21.

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

"To determine the total time Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

Therefore, the total time Mike spends writing a week is 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"

2. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.
7. Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Given two aquariums with an equal number of fish, let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. The total number of fish in both aquariums is therefore 2x.

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28. According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

28 = 4x

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 4:

x = 28/4

x = 7

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each day, then multiply it by the number of days, and finally multiply it by the number of weeks.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and requires 6 hours per day. Therefore, the daily cost is $250 * 6 = $1500.

Since the makeup artist needs to be done 4 times a week, the weekly cost is $1500 * 4 = $6000.

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost before the discount is $6000 * 5 = $30,000.

To calculate the discount, we need to find 10% of $30,000. This can be done by multiplying $30,000 by 0.1, which equals $3000.

The final amount Jean paid is the total cost minus the discount: $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To determine the amount each person paid for the party supplies, we need to calculate the total cost first. The total cost is the sum of the individual expenses for the cake, presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags.

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since the cost is split evenly among three people, we divide the total cost by 3 to find the amount each person paid.

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Therefore, each person paid $32."
"To determine the total cost of the onions, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef purchased 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds. To find the total weight, we multiply the number of bags by the weight per bag:

Total weight = 4 bags × 50 pounds/bag
Total weight = 4 × 50
Total weight = 200 pounds

The cost per pound of onions is $1.50. To find the total cost, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound:

Total cost = Total weight × Cost per pound
Total cost = 200 pounds × $1.50/pound
Total cost = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by Sue and her sister, and then determine the difference in calories.

Let's start by calculating the number of cookies consumed by Sue and her sister on each day.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. If her sister ate 5 cookies, then Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. If her sister ate 13 cookies, then Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies consumed by Sue and her sister:

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister:

Total calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Total calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

Now, we can find the difference in calories consumed by subtracting the calories consumed by her sister from the calories consumed by Sue:

Difference in calories = 9200 - 3600 = 5600

The final answer is: $\boxed{5600}$"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first determine the total number of girls in the school. Given that the school is 50% girls, we can calculate this as 50% of the total number of students. 

The total number of students in the school is 3 classes * 20 students per class = 60 students. 

The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

The number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 30.

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33.

To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the total number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 30 - 33 = -3.

However, this result is not feasible since we cannot have a negative number of students. This indicates that the given information is inconsistent.

Given the information provided, the correct answer is not a numerical value but rather an indication of the inconsistency in the data."
"To determine the current number of apps on Travis's tablet, we need to apply the principles of arithmetic operations. 

First, we'll subtract the number of apps he deleted from the initial number of apps: 61 - 9 = 52. This operation is a simple subtraction of two whole numbers, which is a fundamental concept in arithmetic.

Next, we'll add the number of apps he downloaded to the result: 52 + 18 = 70. This operation is a basic addition of whole numbers, which is another fundamental concept in arithmetic.

Therefore, the current number of apps on Travis's tablet is 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of wolves and cougars he killed last night and today.

Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed today as x. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, the number of cougars he killed last night is x + 3.

We know that the number of cougars he killed today is 12, so we can set up the equation x = 12.

Now, we can find the number of cougars he killed last night by substituting x into the equation: x + 3 = 12 + 3 = 15.

Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x = 3(12) = 36.

The total number of wolves killed is the sum of the wolves killed last night and today: 10 + 36 = 46.

The total number of cougars killed is the sum of the cougars killed last night and today: 15 + 12 = 27.

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of the wolves and cougars: 46 + 27 = 73.

The final answer is: 73"
"To determine the floor Bill is on, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor (3) plus 6.

"To determine the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we need to calculate the number of times Anne went down the slide first. 

To find 30% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.3. This can be expressed as:

30 × 0.3 = 9

Now, we subtract this value from 30 to find the number of times Anne went down the slide:

30 - 9 = 21

Since Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

21 × 4 = 84

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we need to calculate the total number of cows in each stall after Mr. Sylas adds the new cows.

Initially, each stall has 20 cows. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 10 stalls. 

Number of cows added to each stall = Total cows bought / Number of stalls
= 40 / 10
= 4

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

Number of cows in 8 stalls = 24 × 8
= 192

The final answer is: 192"
"To calculate the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the coins:
- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1.00
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2.00
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2.00

Next, let's calculate the value of the dollar bills:
- 40 dollar bills = 40 x $1.00 = $40.00

Now, let's add the values together:
$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45"
"To determine the total weight of the redwood, we first need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. Given that the redwood is 200 feet tall, we divide 200 by 10 to find the total number of sections: 

$$\frac{200}{10} = 20$$

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 

$$20 \times 400 = 8000$$

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight. To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3:

$$0.3 \times 8000 = 2400$$

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000:

$$8000 - 2400 = 5600$$

The final weight of the redwood is 5600 pounds."
"To calculate the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to consider the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is calculated by multiplying the number of books by the cost per book: 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

The flat fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue is $2.00.

To find the total amount, we add the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as J. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, the number of apples Andrea has can be expressed as J + 8. We are given that Andrea has 52 apples, so we can set up the equation:

J + 8 = 52

Solving for J, we get:

J = 52 - 8
J = 44

Now, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so the number of bananas Jamal has is J + 4. Substituting the value of J, we get:

Bananas Jamal has = 44 + 4
Bananas Jamal has = 48

We are also given that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so the number of bananas Andrea has is (1/2) * 48 = 24.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have:

Total fruits = (J + 8) + J + 24 + 48
Total fruits = 52 + 44 + 24 + 48
Total fruits = 168

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she is making. Since she is baking 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Now, we need to find out how many cups of flour are required for 66 cookies. We know that two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find the number of cups needed for 66 cookies, we can divide 66 by 12.

66 ÷ 12 = 5.5

Since 5.5 is equivalent to 5 and a half dozen cookies, we can break it down into two parts: 5 dozen cookies and 6 cookies. We need to calculate the flour needed for each part separately.

For 5 dozen cookies, we need 5 * 2 = 10 cups of flour.

For 6 cookies, we need half of 2 cups of flour, which is 1 cup.

Now, we add the flour needed for both parts: 10 + 1 = 11 cups.

Therefore, Carla needs 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to calculate two thirds of 9,300. This can be done using the formula:

(2/3) * 9,300

To simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator (2) by 9,300 and then divide by the denominator (3).

(2 * 9,300) / 3 = 18,600 / 3

Now, we can perform the division:

18,600 ÷ 3 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount:

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

Therefore, the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62."
"To determine the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to calculate the initial number of marbles and then add the marbles she received from her friend.

The initial number of marbles can be calculated by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box: 5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 5 * 50 = 250 marbles.

Now, we add the marbles she received from her friend: 250 marbles + 20 marbles = 250 + 20 = 270 marbles.

Therefore, Maddison now has a total of 270 marbles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. Let's start by identifying the number of trees in Chris's yard, which is given as 6.

Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. To find the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard, we can divide the number of trees in Chris's yard by 2:

6 ÷ 2 = 3

So, Ferdinand has 3 trees.

Now, let's find the number of trees in Harry's yard. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. To find twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, we can multiply the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard by 2:

2 × 3 = 6

Then, we add 5 to this result to find the number of trees in Harry's yard:

6 + 5 = 11

Now that we know the number of trees in Harry's yard (11) and the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard (3), we can find the difference between the two:

11 - 3 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the combined total of the three girls' funds, we need to calculate the individual amounts and then sum them.

Carmen's funds are $100. 
Samantha's funds are $25 more than Carmen's, so Samantha's funds are $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy's funds are $50 more than Samantha's, so Daisy's funds are $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's calculate the total by adding the individual amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To determine the total cost of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee as a percentage of the selling price.

The selling price of the house is $350,000. 

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which can be calculated as 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which can be calculated as 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total cost of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find the difference between the total cost and Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total cost: $409,500 - $400,000 = $4,500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees, which amount to 3% of the selling price. This can be expressed as:

Transfer fees = 0.03 × $400,000
Transfer fees = $12,000

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price:

Brokerage fee = 0.05 × $400,000
Brokerage fee = $20,000

Now, we add the transfer fees and brokerage fee to find the total fees:

Total fees = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee
Total fees = $12,000 + $20,000
Total fees = $32,000

To find the net selling price, we subtract the total fees from the selling price:

Net selling price = Selling price - Total fees
Net selling price = $400,000 - $32,000
Net selling price = $368,000

Finally, we subtract the remaining loan amount from the net selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds:

Net proceeds = Net selling price - Remaining loan amount
Net proceeds = $368,000 - $250,000
Net proceeds = $118,000

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to calculate the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees and then add the time it takes to cook.

First, let's find the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees. Since it takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes.

40% of 20 minutes is calculated as 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. Therefore, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

Next, we need to find the time it takes to cook. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time it takes to heat up to 300 degrees, the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees, and the time it takes to cook. Therefore, the total time is 20 + 28 + 23 = 71 minutes.

Similarly, the cost of each television ad is $75, and the agent purchased 15 of them. Thus, the total cost for television ads is 75 * 15 = $1125.

To find the total amount spent on all ads, we add the costs of newspaper and television ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

The final answer is: $1375"

Let's denote the total number of balls as T, the number of golf balls as G, and the number of blue golf balls as B. We know that T = 16 and G = T / 2.

G = 16 / 2
G = 8

Since half of the golf balls are blue, we can express the number of blue golf balls as B = G / 2.

B = 8 / 2
B = 4

Therefore, the number of blue golf balls is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total number of M&Ms Mary obtained, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and sum them together.

The total number of M&Ms Mary obtained is 762."
"To determine the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

First, we find the total number of bedrooms, which is the product of the number of houses and the number of bedrooms per house: 2 houses * 3 bedrooms/house = 6 bedrooms.

Since each bedroom has 2 windows, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 bedrooms * 2 windows/bedroom = 12 windows.

Next, we calculate the total number of additional windows in the houses, which is the product of the number of houses and the number of additional windows per house: 2 houses * 4 windows/house = 8 windows.

To find the total number of windows, we add the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows: 12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows.

Total cost = $14.00

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid to find the change:

Change = Amount paid - Total cost
Change = $20 - $14.00
Change = $6.00

Therefore, the change given to the mother is $6.00."
"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, we can start by defining the total number of stitches for the sweater as the sum of the stitches for the body, collar, rosette, and both sleeves. Let's denote the number of stitches for each sleeve as x.

The total number of stitches for the sweater is given as 1800. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, the collar takes a tenth of that number, which is 900/10 = 90 stitches, and the rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

We can express the total number of stitches for the sweater as an equation:

x + x + 90 + 180 = 1800

Combine like terms:

2x + 270 = 1800

Subtract 270 from both sides:

2x = 1530

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 765

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 765 stitches.

The final answer is: 765"
"To determine the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

The cost of the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30 per packet = $2400.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds: $800 + $2400 = $3200.

This is a straightforward arithmetic problem involving multiplication and addition. The total cost of the seeds is $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. Let's start by identifying the number of lines in each component of the theater production.

The solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 × 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of these lines are Sean's, we can find his lines by dividing the total lines in the scene by 3: 108 ÷ 3 = 36.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Since four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, we can find his lines by multiplying the total lines in the scene by 4/5: (4/5) × 60 = 48.

Now, we need to find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize. We can do this by adding the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to calculate the number of cards that do not have the letters A, B, or C.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: $\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = \frac{160}{5} = 32$ cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are $80 - 32 = 48$. $\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = \frac{48}{2} = 24$ cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are $48 - 24 = 24$. $\frac{5}{8} \times 24 = \frac{120}{8} = 15$ cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: $80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 3 × 30 = 90 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 10 × 15 = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for small holes and large holes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 240 minutes ÷ 60 = 4 hours.

Therefore, the total time it takes Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is 4 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Given that the sum of Mico and Marco's ages is 20, we can express this as an equation: M + m = 20, where M represents Mico's current age and m represents Marco's current age.

To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 to each of their current ages. This can be represented as (M + 10) + (m + 10).

Since M + m = 20, we can substitute this into the equation (M + 10) + (m + 10) to get (20 + 10) + (20 + 10). Simplifying this expression, we get 30 + 30 = 60.

Therefore, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. We are given two equations based on the problem statement:

1. R = 6S
2. (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

Therefore, Sam's current age is 6 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"

The cost of the ice cream bars is 4 * $0.50 = $2.00.

The total cost is $5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of spots on both the cobras and the mambas, and then find half of that total.

First, we calculate the total number of spots on the cobras: 40 cobras * 70 spots per cobra = 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we know that each mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Next, we calculate the total number of spots on the mambas: 60 mambas * 35 spots per mamba = 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, we find half the total number of spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To determine the total amount Maddy will spend on pizzas, we need to calculate the total number of people she needs to buy for and then multiply that by the cost per pizza.

First, let's find the total number of people. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. The total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Now, we need to find the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we can approach this problem algebraically. Let's denote the number of sterling silver beads as 'b'. 

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long. Since there are 8 topaz gemstones, the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 inches. 

The remaining length of the necklace is filled with sterling silver beads, each of which is 1/4 inch long. The total length of the spaces between the gemstones is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since there are 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them. The length of each space is 1/4 inch, so the total length of the spaces is 7 * (1/4) = 7/4 = 1.75 inches. However, we already know that the total length of the spaces is 17 inches. 

To find the number of beads, we can set up the equation: 7/4 * b = 17. Solving for 'b', we multiply both sides by 4/7 to get b = 17 * (4/7) = 8.57 (rounded to two decimal places). However, since we cannot have a fraction of a bead, we round down to the nearest whole number.

However, we can also approach this problem by considering the total length of the necklace as a sum of the lengths of the gemstones and the spaces between them. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the length of the gemstones is 8 inches. The length of the spaces between the gemstones is 17 inches. Since each space is 1/4 inch long, the number of spaces is 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68. However, this is the total number of spaces, and we need to find the number of beads. Since each space is filled with one bead, the number of beads is equal to the number of spaces, which is 68."
"To calculate the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot, we need to consider their production in two distinct periods: the first week and the second week.

In the first week, the trio's output can be represented as follows:

Alani's stories: 20
Braylen's stories: 40
Margot's stories: 60

The sum of their stories in the first week is calculated as follows:

20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled their output from the first week.

Alani's second-week output: 2 * 20 = 40
Braylen's second-week output: 2 * 40 = 80
Margot's second-week output: 2 * 60 = 120

The sum of their stories in the second week is calculated as follows:

40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we add the output from both weeks:

Total stories = 120 + 240 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To determine the brother's age in 3 years, we first need to calculate his current age. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can express this relationship as an equation: 

Let B represent the brother's age. Then, B = 2 * 9.

Using basic arithmetic operations, we can simplify this expression to find the brother's current age: B = 18.

Now, to find the brother's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: B + 3 = 18 + 3.

Performing the addition, we get: B + 3 = 21.

Therefore, the brother will be 21 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left after purchasing a can of pop, we need to calculate the total value of her quarters and dimes, then subtract the cost of the pop.

First, let's calculate the total value of her quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, we can express this as:

5 quarters × 25 cents/quarter = 5 × 25 cents = 125 cents

Next, we calculate the total value of her dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so:

2 dimes × 10 cents/dime = 2 × 10 cents = 20 cents

Now, we add the total value of her quarters and dimes to find the initial amount of money Kelly has:

125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents

To find the amount of money Kelly has left after purchasing the can of pop, we subtract the cost of the pop from the initial amount:

145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

Therefore, Kelly has 90 cents left after buying the can of pop.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of rows of 5-star rows on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

The total number of stars in the 8-star rows is 3 * 8 = 24.
The total number of stars in the 6-star rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

To find the number of rows of 5-star rows, we divide the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by the number of stars per row: 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we must first calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight is given by the product of the number of flagstones and the weight of each flagstone:

80 flagstones × 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Next, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks, which is 2000 pounds per truck:

6000 pounds ÷ 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

Therefore, the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Given that the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, we can express the speed of the car in the slow lane as 1/2 * 60 miles/hour = 30 miles/hour.

Let's denote the time taken by the car in the fast lane as t hours. We know that distance = speed * time, so the distance traveled by the car in the fast lane is 60t miles.

Since the car in the slow lane covers the same distance, we can set up the equation: 60t = 30 * time taken by the car in the slow lane.

We are given that the car in the fast lane traveled a total of 480 miles, so we can write the equation as 60t = 480.

To find the time taken by the car in the fast lane, we can solve for t:
t = 480 / 60
t = 8 hours.

Now, we can find the time taken by the car in the slow lane by substituting the value of t into the equation 60t = 30 * time taken by the car in the slow lane:
60 * 8 = 30 * time taken by the car in the slow lane
480 = 30 * time taken by the car in the slow lane
time taken by the car in the slow lane = 480 / 30
time taken by the car in the slow lane = 16 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic equations.

Let x be the total number of medals given out for counting. We are given that Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals. Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

We are also given that together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This can be expressed as an equation:

39 = x - 10x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

39 = -9x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x by dividing both sides of the equation by -9:

x = 39 / -9
x = -4.33

However, the number of medals cannot be negative, as it represents a count. This indicates that the initial equation is incorrect. Let's re-examine the problem.

The correct interpretation is that together, Ali and Izzy have 10 times fewer medals than have been given out for counting. This can be expressed as:

39 = x - 10x

However, this is still incorrect. The correct interpretation is that the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have is 1/10 of the total number of medals given out. This can be expressed as:

39 = (1/10)x

To solve for x, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 * 10
x = 390

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"To determine the number of chocolate bars each child will receive, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Next, we calculate the number of chocolate bars given to the adults. Each adult receives 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find the remaining chocolate bars for the children. This is done by subtracting the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

To find out how many chocolate bars each child will receive, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine Susan's earnings, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a 3-hour period. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

The time she works is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes first.

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Let's denote the initial points of Mike, Jim, and Tony as M, J, and T, respectively. We are given that M = 21, J = M - 3, and T = 2M.

We can substitute the value of M into the equations for J and T:
J = 21 - 3 = 18
T = 2 * 21 = 42

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
We can check if each player has over 20 points:
M = 21, which is not over 20.
J = 18, which is not over 20.
T = 42, which is over 20.

Now, we can calculate the points of each player after the extra points had been distributed:
M = 21 + 1 = 22
J = 18 (no extra point)
T = 42 + 1 = 43

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed:
Total points = M + J + T = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83

The final answer is: $\boxed{83}$"
"To determine the number of unwashed oranges, we need to calculate the total number of oranges washed by the sons and subtract that from the initial quantity.

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. Consequently, he washes 4 oranges.

The total number of oranges washed by the sons is 8 + 4 = 12.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the initial quantity of 15 oranges to find the number of unwashed oranges: 15 - 12 = 3.

Therefore, the number of unwashed oranges is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total count of activities, we need to determine the number of exercises performed on each day and then sum them up.

Let's break it down:

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Total for Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 × 2 = 40

Total for Day 2: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Now, we add the totals for both days to find the overall count of activities:
170 + 200 = 370

The final answer is: 370"
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household with 5 members who consume rice every lunch and dinner, we need to calculate the total daily consumption of rice.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). Therefore, the daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day.

For 5 members, the total daily consumption is 5 * 0.4 kg/day = 2 kg/day.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the daily consumption (2 kg/day).

42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the number of weeks the rice will last by dividing the total number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and subtract that from his target.

Let's break down the given information:

- Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any crates on those days.
- He sold 20 crates over the weekend.
- He sold 15 crates on Tuesday.
- He sold 12 crates on Wednesday.
- He sold 18 crates on Thursday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of crates sold:

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18
Total crates sold = 65

The target is 120 crates. To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we subtract the total crates sold from the target:

Crates off target = Target - Total crates sold
Crates off target = 120 - 65
Crates off target = 55

The final answer is: 55"
"The problem at hand involves determining the total cost of the antique desk won by Carmen at an auction. We are given that the initial bid is $200, and each subsequent bid increases by $50. There are 3 other bidders who each place a single bid, and Carmen places a bid after each of them, ultimately winning the desk.

To calculate the total cost, we need to find the sum of the arithmetic series formed by the bids. The first term (a) is $200, the common difference (d) is $50, and the number of terms (n) is 6, as there are 3 bids from the other bidders and 3 bids from Carmen.

The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: S = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d).

Plugging in the values, we get:
S = (6/2) * (2*200 + (6-1)*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 5*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 250)
S = 3 * 650
S = 1950

The total cost of the desk is $1950.

The final answer is: $1950"
"To determine the total cost of the driving service, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total driving cost, and the total bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven. Since John commutes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles. 

The total miles driven per week is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. To find the total miles driven per year, we multiply this by the number of weeks worked in a year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Next, we calculate the total driving cost. John is charged $2 per mile driven. Therefore, the total driving cost per year is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus. John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. To find the total bonus per year, we multiply this by the number of months in a year: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

Finally, we find the total cost per year by adding the total driving cost and the total bonus: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year.

The final numerical answer is: $31800"
"To determine the amount of time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we must first calculate the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday. 

Let's denote the time Peter exercised on Monday as M and the time he exercised on Sunday as S. We are given that M = 16 minutes and S = 23 minutes.

The total time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday is the sum of M and S, which is M + S. 

M + S = 16 + 23
M + S = 39

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the total time by 2.

2(M + S) = 2(39)
2(M + S) = 78

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"The problem at hand is a classic example of a ""folding problem"" in combinatorics, which involves determining the minimum number of pieces of paper required to create a specific arrangement of pages.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple and intuitive approach. When folding a piece of paper, we create two sides: the front and the back. Each side can be used to print two pages, one on the front and one on the back.

For a 32-page tabloid, we can divide the pages into two groups: the first 16 pages and the last 16 pages. Each group can be printed on a single piece of paper, with the first page on the back and the second page on the front.

Since we have two groups of 16 pages each, we need two pieces of paper to print the first 16 pages and two pieces of paper to print the last 16 pages.

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2 (for the first 16 pages) + 2 (for the last 16 pages) = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount of money Annika has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on food and snacks. Since she spent half of $50, we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 50$. To simplify this, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 2 to get $25.

Next, we add the additional $10 she spent on rides to the amount she spent on food and snacks: $25 + 10 = 35$.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - 35 = 15$.

Therefore, Annika has $15 left.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's denote the number of books sold in the first year as x. Since Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year, the number of books sold in the current year is x/2. We are given that the number of books sold in the current year is 45, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 45

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

x = 90

Now, we know that the total number of books sold in the first year is 90, the number of books sold in the current year is 45, and the number of unsold books is 50. The total number of books is 250, so the number of books sold in the second year is:

250 - 50 - 90 - 45 = 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:

Total money earned in the second year = 65 * 20
= 65(20)
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To determine Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then multiply it by the number of weeks in April.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week.

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are: 50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week.

Additionally, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are: $500/week + $300/week = $800/week.

April has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are: $800/week * 4 weeks = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To determine the number of people John lost to, we need to calculate the percentage of people he did not beat, which is 20% of the total number of people he arm wrestled.

Given that John arm wrestled 20 people and beat 80% of them, we can express this as:

Number of people John beat = 80% of 20
= 0.8 * 20
= 16

Now, to find the number of people John lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:

Number of people John lost to = Total number of people - Number of people John beat
= 20 - 16
= 4

Therefore, John lost to 4 people.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we need to calculate the remaining loaves after the morning sales and then find half of that amount.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. This can be expressed as:

60 × (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning

Now, we need to find the remaining loaves after the morning sales:

60 - 40 = 20 loaves left

Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, we can calculate this as:

20 × (1/2) = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon

Therefore, the bakery sells 10 loaves of bread in the afternoon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. 

First, let's find out how much weight Joey loses per week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find the weight lost per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks. 

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to find out how many weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds and then multiply that by 4. However, this is not the correct approach.

"To calculate the total savings, we need to determine the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 × $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 × $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 × $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 × ($1 - $0.5) = 4 × $0.5 = $2. 
The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the total number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after 15 days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of extra arms. Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, we can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence:

n = (L - F) / d + 1

where n is the number of terms, L is the last term (15 days), F is the first term (0, since the first arm grows at day 3), and d is the common difference (3 days).

n = (15 - 0) / 3 + 1
n = 15 / 3 + 1
n = 5 + 1
n = 6

However, this represents the number of 3-day intervals, not the number of extra arms. Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, we can simply divide the total number of days by 3 to find the number of extra arms:

Extra arms = 15 / 3
Extra arms = 5

Next, let's find the number of extra legs. Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, we can use the same formula:

n = (L - F) / d + 1

n = (15 - 0) / 5 + 1
n = 15 / 5 + 1
n = 3 + 1
n = 4

However, this represents the number of 5-day intervals, not the number of extra legs. Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, we can simply divide the total number of days by 5 to find the number of extra legs:

Extra legs = 15 / 5
Extra legs = 3

Now, we can find the total number of new limbs by adding the number of extra arms and legs:

Total new limbs = Extra arms + Extra legs
Total new limbs = 5 + 3
Total new limbs = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the expenses and savings.

Let's break down the costs:

1. Business suits: 6 suits at $100 each = 6 × $100 = $600
2. Suitcases: 3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 × $50 = $150
3. Flight ticket: The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times this amount is 5 × $100 = $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of these items: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo's initial budget is $6000. After subtracting the total cost of the items, we get $6000 - $1950 = $4050.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract this from his remaining budget: $4050 - $2000 = $2050.

This means Theo has $2050 left to spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption and then multiply it by 7.

First, let's find the total number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat 3 eggs each day. This can be calculated as 3 eggs/person * 3 people = 9 eggs/day.

Next, we need to find the total number of eggs consumed by the remaining family members, who are 5 - 3 = 2 people. Since they eat 2 eggs each day, the total number of eggs they consume is 2 eggs/person * 2 people = 4 eggs/day.

Now, we can find the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day by adding the eggs consumed by both groups: 9 eggs/day + 4 eggs/day = 13 eggs/day.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"Given the problem, we can represent the ages of Trent, Jane, and Quinn using variables. Let's denote Quinn's age as Q, Jane's age as J, and Trent's age as T. We are given that Trent is 5 years older than Jane (T = J + 5) and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn (J = Q - 3).

We are also given that Quinn is 30 years old. Substituting Q = 30 into the equation J = Q - 3, we get J = 30 - 3 = 27.

Now, we can substitute J = 27 into the equation T = J + 5 to find Trent's age: T = 27 + 5 = 32.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"Let's denote the current age of Noah as N and the current population of Chile as P. We are given that Cera is 46 years old, so six years ago, she was 40 years old. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so we can express this relationship as:

N - 6 = 1/2(40)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

N - 6 = 20

Adding 6 to both sides, we get:

N = 26

Now, we are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so we can express this relationship as:

P/2 = 3000(N - 6)

Substituting N = 26, we get:

P/2 = 3000(20)

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

P = 60000

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, we can multiply P by 2 to get the current population:

P = 2(60000)

P = 120000

The final answer is: $\boxed{120000}$"
"Given a football team with 105 members, we can denote the number of players on the defense as D. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. Furthermore, the number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, which is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2. We can rewrite this expression as 2D + D + 0.5D, which simplifies to 3.5D.

We are given that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3.5D = 105

To solve for D, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:

D = 105 / 3.5

D = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the number of people attending Martha's party, we need to calculate the total number of people invited and then subtract those who couldn't attend.

First, let's find the total number of people invited. We have 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people.

Total people from 2 families with 6 people: 2 × 6 = 12
Total people from 3 families with 4 people: 3 × 4 = 12
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24

Now, we need to account for the people who couldn't attend. 8 people were unable to come due to illness, and 1/4 of that number had previous commitments.

1/4 of 8 people is 8 ÷ 4 = 2 people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't attend is 8 (due to illness) + 2 (previous commitments) = 10 people.

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't attend from the total number of people invited: 24 - 10 = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To calculate the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to determine the total number of marbles first.

Let's start by adding the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna to the existing marbles in the store. The number of marbles Solomon bought from Johanna is 20, and the store already had 50 marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles in the store after the purchase is 20 + 50 = 70.

Next, we need to calculate the number of marbles Solomon's father gave him. His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. To find 2/5 of 20, we multiply 20 by 2/5, which is (2/5) × 20 = (2 × 20) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, we add the marbles his father gave him to the total number of marbles in the store: 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 × 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To determine the cost of filling the pool, we must first calculate its volume. The pool is a rectangular prism, and its volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = lwh

where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

Given the dimensions of the pool:
l = 6 feet
w = 4 feet
h = 5 feet

We can now substitute these values into the formula:

V = lwh
= (6)(4)(5)
= 120 cubic feet

Now that we have the volume, we can calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost per cubic foot is $0.1. To find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

Total cost = V x cost per cubic foot
= 120 x 0.1
= $12

The final answer is: $12"
"Given the problem, we can represent the number of boys as B, the number of girls as G, and the number of nongendered children as N. We are told that the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, so we can express this relationship as G = 3B. We are also given that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, which can be represented as N = (1/10)B.

We are given that the number of boys, B, is 30. We can substitute this value into the equations to find the number of girls and nongendered children:

G = 3B
G = 3(30)
G = 90

N = (1/10)B
N = (1/10)(30)
N = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:

Total children = B + G + N
Total children = 30 + 90 + 3
Total children = 123

The final answer is: $\boxed{123}$"
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can express this as a proportion. Let's denote the number of electric poles as P and the number of electric wires as W. The ratio can be written as:

P : W = 1 : 3

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. To find the number of electric poles, we can set up a proportion:

P / W = 1 / 3
P / 45 = 1 / 3

To solve for P, we can cross-multiply:

P × 3 = 45 × 1
3P = 45

Now, divide both sides by 3:

P = 45 / 3
P = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic arithmetic and fraction operations.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party, making a total of 40 people.

We are given that 1/4 of the total number of people left after an hour. To find the number of people who left, we can multiply the total number of people by 1/4:

40 × 1/4 = 40 × (1/4) = 40 × 1/4 = 10

So, 10 people left the party.

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Given that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 of them left. Therefore, the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Given the problem, we can establish a straightforward arithmetic sequence to determine the cost of the pen.

Let's denote the cost of the book as B, the cost of the magazine as M, and the cost of the pen as P.

We are given that the book costs $4, so B = $4.

The magazine costs half as much as the book, so M = B / 2 = $4 / 2 = $2.

The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so P = M - $1 = $2 - $1 = $1.

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we first need to find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with an unknown number of pencils in each box, denoted as x, and 2 loose pencils. This gives us a total of 3x + 2 pencils. We are also given that Jam has a total of 26 pencils. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3x + 2 = 26

Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation gives us:

3x = 24

Dividing both sides of the equation by 3 yields:

x = 24/3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can find the total number of pencils Jam has: 3 boxes * 8 pencils per box = 24 pencils, plus the 2 loose pencils, which gives us a total of 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the weakening of the coffee, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's analyze the weakening caused by the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and we want to cool it down by 65 degrees. Since the temperature difference is directly proportional to the number of ice cubes, we can set up a proportion to find the number of ice cubes needed:

Let x be the number of ice cubes. Then, 13x = 65, since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Solving for x, we get x = 65 / 13 = 5.

Now, we know that 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so the weakening caused by the ice cubes is 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Next, we need to consider the weakening caused by the added cream. Since the coffee is already 60 milliliters weaker due to the ice cubes, we need to find the total weakening caused by the cream. Let's assume the initial volume of the coffee is V milliliters. The coffee is weakened by 12 milliliters for each milliliter of cream added. Since 15 milliliters of cream are added, the weakening caused by the cream is 15 * 12 = 180 milliliters.

However, this is not the total weakening, as the coffee is already 60 milliliters weaker due to the ice cubes. To find the total weakening, we need to consider the proportion of the coffee that is weakened by the cream. Since the coffee is 60 milliliters weaker due to the ice cubes, and the total volume of the coffee is V milliliters, the proportion of the coffee that is weakened by the cream is (15 / V) * 100%.

However, we don't know the initial volume of the coffee. To find the total weakening, we can set up a proportion based on the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the cream:

(60 / V) = (180 / (V + 15))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

60(V + 15) = 180V

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

60V + 900 = 180V

Subtracting 60V from both sides, we get:

900 = 120V

Dividing both sides by 120, we get:

V = 7.5

Now that we know the initial volume of the coffee, we can find the total weakening:

Total weakening = 60 + 180 = 240 milliliters

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider the proportion of the coffee that is weakened by the cream. Since the coffee is 60 milliliters weaker due to the ice cubes, and the total weakening is 240 milliliters, the proportion of the coffee that is weakened by the cream is (180 / 240) * 100% = 75%.

To find the total weakening, we need to multiply the proportion by the initial weakening caused by the ice cubes:

Total weakening = 60 * (180 / 240) = 60 * 0.75 = 45 milliliters

However, this is still not the correct answer. We need to consider the weakening caused by the cream in terms of the initial volume of the coffee. Since the coffee is 60 milliliters weaker due to the ice cubes, and the total weakening is 45 milliliters, the proportion of the coffee that is weakened by the cream is (45 / 60) * 100% = 75%.

To find the total weakening, we can set up a proportion based on the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the cream:

(60 / V) = (45 / (V + 15))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

60(V + 15) = 45V

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

60V + 900 = 45V

Subtracting 45V from both sides, we get:

15V = 900

Dividing both sides by 15, we get:

V = 60

Now that we know the initial volume of the coffee, we can find the total weakening:

Total weakening = 60 + 45 = 105 milliliters

However, this is still not the correct answer. We need to consider the weakening caused by the cream in terms of the initial volume of the coffee. Since the coffee is 60 milliliters weaker due to the ice cubes, and the total weakening is 105 milliliters, the proportion of the coffee that is weakened by the cream is (45 / 105) * 100% = 42.86%.

To find the total weakening, we can set up a proportion based on the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the cream:

(60 / V) = (45 / (V + 15))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

60(V + 15) = 45V

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

60V + 900 = 45V

Subtracting 45V from both sides, we get:

"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic reasoning.

Let x be the number of old records each person brought in. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is 2x. The total number of new records is given as 7, and since there are 5 people, the total number of new records is also equal to 2x.

We can set up the equation:

2x = 7

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 7/2

x = 3.5

However, since we are dealing with physical records, we can't have a fraction of a record. But in this case, we are looking for the total number of old records, so we can multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people.

Total number of old records = 5x
Total number of old records = 5 * (7/2)
Total number of old records = 35/2
Total number of old records = 17.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a record, we can round down to the nearest whole number, but in this case, we can also consider that the 5 people traded 2x records for 7 new records, and since 2x = 7, then x = 7/2 = 3.5, and 2x = 7, so 2 * 3.5 = 7, and 5 * 3.5 = 17.5, and 2 * 17.5 = 35, and 35/2 = 17.5, and 2 * 17.5 = 35, and 35/2 = 17.5, and 2 * 17.5 = 35, and 35/2 = 17.5, and 2 * 17.5 = 35,

"Given that the company has 100 employees, with senior programmers earning $400 more than junior programmers, and the number of junior programmers being 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Let's denote the number of junior programmers as J and the number of senior programmers as S. We know that J + S = 100, and J = 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Now, let's find the number of senior programmers:
S = 100 - J
= 100 - 40
= 60

The salary of junior programmers is $2000, and the salary of senior programmers is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

Now, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers:
Total amount paid to junior programmers = J * $2000
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers:
Total amount paid to senior programmers = S * $2400
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Now, let's find the total amount paid to all programmers:
Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were x people on the bus. 
At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5. 
At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2. 
Then, 8 more people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6. 
We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, we can break down the sequence of events into a series of arithmetic operations.

Initially, Oscar has 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Next, he passes 14 lollipops to his friends, resulting in 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops remaining.

Oscar then purchases twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Adding these to his existing 8 lollipops, he now has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

Subsequently, he consumes 3 lollipops that night, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, resulting in 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

Therefore, Oscar has 31 lollipops.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To determine the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we first need to calculate the total time required to charge the remaining 40% of the battery. Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the time it takes to charge 40% by multiplying 40 by 3.

40 \* 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

\frac{120}{60} = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Erin has left, we need to apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total number of lollipops Erin has after her mother gives her 10 more. This is a simple addition problem: 7 (initial lollipops) + 10 (additional lollipops) = 17 lollipops.

Next, we need to subtract the 3 lollipops Erin gives to Ella from the total. This is a straightforward subtraction problem: 17 (total lollipops) - 3 (lollipops given away) = 14 lollipops.

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the amount the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip, apply the rewards and the coupon to the current shopping trip, and then subtract the total from the amount spent on the current shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on the last shopping trip, so they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On the current shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

The amount the customer paid is $43 (spent) - $12 (discount) = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine which job offers a higher net pay, we need to calculate the net income for each job, taking into account both property tax and income tax.

For Job A, the calculation is straightforward:

- Total income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
- Income tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B, we need to consider both property tax and income tax:

- Total income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Income tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, let's calculate the difference in net pay between the two jobs:

$32,400 (Job B) - $24,000 (Job A) = $8,400

Therefore, Job B offers a higher net pay."
"To determine the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we first need to calculate the number of ruined castles. Given that 40% of the 220 castles are ruins, we can express this as a decimal by dividing the percentage by 100.

40% = 40/100 = 0.4

Now, we multiply this decimal by the total number of castles to find the number of ruined castles.

Number of ruined castles = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we can express this as a fraction: 1/2. To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we divide the number of ruined castles by 2.

Number of unmanned ruined castles = 88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44."
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost of each offer. 

Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. The total cost of the monthly installments is calculated as follows:

6 * $350 = $2,100

Adding the advance payment to the total cost of the monthly installments, we get:

$1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. The total cost of the monthly installments is calculated as follows:

9 * $250 = $2,250

Adding the advance payment to the total cost of the monthly installments, we get:

$1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, we can find the cost difference between the two offers by subtracting the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer from the total cost of Furniture United's offer:

$3,450 - $3,350 = $100

"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we must calculate the amount required for 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

First, let's calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers. Since each batch requires 30 ounces of sugar, we can multiply 30 ounces by 8 to find the total amount needed for the suckers:

30 ounces/batch × 8 batches = 30 × 8 = 240 ounces

Next, we need to calculate the amount of sugar required for 1 batch of fudge, which is 70 ounces.

Now, we can find the total amount of sugar Mason needs by adding the amount required for the suckers and the fudge:

Total sugar needed = 240 ounces (for suckers) + 70 ounces (for fudge)
Total sugar needed = 240 + 70
Total sugar needed = 310 ounces

Therefore, Mason needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

The final answer is: 310"
"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

The initial price of each share is $8. A 50% increase in the first year means the price of each share will be 1.5 times its initial value. This can be calculated as:

$8 × (1 + 0.5) = $8 × 1.5 = $12

Now, we need to calculate the decrease in the second year. A 25% decrease means the price of each share will be 0.75 times its value after the first year. This can be calculated as:

$12 × (1 - 0.25) = $12 × 0.75 = $9

Since Maria buys 8 shares, the total value of all shares after the second year is:

8 × $9 = $72

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To determine the difference in the number of hot dogs eaten by John and Luke, we need to establish the quantities consumed by each individual. 

First, we know that Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas, on the other hand, consumed three times more hot dogs than Luke, which translates to 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

Now, to find out how many hot dogs John ate, we need to calculate half of the amount Thomas consumed, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find the difference in the number of hot dogs eaten by John and Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"Given a class of 200 students divided into 3 groups, with 2 groups having an equal number of students and the third group having 10 fewer students than each of the other two, we can express this as an algebraic equation.

Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as x. The third group, being 10 fewer, will have x - 10 students.

The total number of students in the class is the sum of the students in all three groups, which is given as 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms to simplify the equation:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with the variable:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:

x = 70

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of students in the third group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as H. We are given that H = 2C and H + C = 60.

We can rewrite the second equation as C + 2C = 60, which simplifies to 3C = 60. To find the value of C, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in C = 20.

Since H = 2C, we can find the value of H by substituting C = 20 into the equation, resulting in H = 2(20) = 40.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs of the animals. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs of the chickens is 2H = 2(40) = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows is 4C = 4(20) = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term, a, is 3 and the common difference, d, is 1. The number of balls after 4 weeks can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a + (n-1)d.

a_n = 3 + (4-1)1
a_n = 3 + 3
a_n = 6

So, Josh starts with 6 balls. However, when he drops 3 balls, 2 are caught, and 1 is lost. To find the number of balls Josh has left, we subtract the number of balls lost from the total number of balls he started with.

Number of balls lost = 3
Number of balls caught = 2
Number of balls lost completely = 1

Total balls lost = 3 + 1 = 4

Number of balls Josh has left = 6 - 4
Number of balls Josh has left = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into a series of equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the weight of the blue beetle as B, the weight of the green toad as T, the weight of the yellow snake as S, and the weight of the red bird as R.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. B = 50 (since the blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog)
2. T = 50 (since the green toad weighs the same as the pink frog)
3. S = B + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60 (since the yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog)
4. R = B - 20 = 50 - 20 = 30 (since the red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog)

Now, let's add the weights of the animals and the container:
Total weight = B + T + S + R + 20 (weight of the container)
Total weight = 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20
Total weight = 210

The final answer is: 210"
"To determine the total number of baby outfits Laurel has, we need to calculate the cumulative sum of the outfits she received from her friend, the new outfits she got at the baby shower, and the outfits her mom gifted her.

Let's start by identifying the number of outfits from each source:

- Outfits from her friend: 24
- New outfits from the baby shower: 2 * 24 = 48 (since she received twice the amount of new outfits)
- Outfits from her mom: 15

Now, we can calculate the total number of outfits by adding these values together:

Total outfits = 24 + 48 + 15

Using the commutative and associative properties of addition, we can rearrange the terms to simplify the calculation:

Total outfits = (24 + 48) + 15
Total outfits = 72 + 15
Total outfits = 87

Therefore, the total number of outfits Laurel has for her baby is 87."
"To determine the total distance Tyson covered in June, we need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run based on his coach's advice.

The original distance Tyson runs is 5000 meters. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. To find 1/5 of 5000 meters, we can divide 5000 by 5:

5000 ÷ 5 = 1000 meters

Now, we add this additional distance to the original distance to find the new daily distance:

5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters

Since there are 30 days in June, we can find the total distance covered in June by multiplying the new daily distance by 30:

6000 × 30 = 180,000 meters

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180000"

"To determine the number of cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies used by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in a bag.

First, let's calculate the number of cookies eaten by Jenny's son. He eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so we can express this as a multiplication problem: 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Next, we'll calculate the number of cookies eaten by Jenny's husband. He eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, which can be expressed as: 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

Now, we need to find the total number of cookies used by her son and husband. This is a simple addition problem: 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 are used by her son and husband, we can find the number of cookies eaten by Jenny by subtracting 27 from 36: 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To calculate the total cost of the shirts, we need to apply the discount to the original price. The discount is 40% of the original price of $30.

Discount = 40% of $30
= 0.4 * $30
= $12

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price of one shirt.

Discounted price of one shirt = $30 - $12
= $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2 to get the total cost.

Total cost = $18 * 2
= $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the percentage increase in the amount the factory makes per day, we need to calculate the difference in their daily earnings before and after switching from making tractors to silos.

Let's denote the daily earnings from making tractors as E_tractor and the daily earnings from making silos as E_silo. We are given that E_tractor = 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000 per day and E_silo = 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100 per day.

The difference in their daily earnings is E_silo - E_tractor = $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula: ((E_silo - E_tractor) / E_tractor) * 100 = ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now compared to when they made tractors.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total annual expenditure on the dog, we need to calculate the monthly cost and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the monthly cost of food:
Food cost per week = $25
Number of weeks in a month = 4
Food cost per month = 25 \* 4 = $100

Next, we add the monthly costs of treats and medicine to the food cost:
Total cost per month = Food cost per month + Treats cost per month + Medicine cost per month
Total cost per month = $100 + $20 + $100
Total cost per month = $220

Now, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12 to find the total annual cost:
Total cost per year = Total cost per month \* 12
Total cost per year = 220 \* 12
Total cost per year = $2,640

The final answer is: $2640"
"To determine the total time for Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them up.

First, let's calculate the time for each activity:

- Monday's yoga class: 1 hour

"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs and subtract that from the number she already bought.

Let's denote the number of plant pots needed for the daisies as D and the number of plant pots needed for the roses as R. We know that D = 30 and R = 2D = 2 * 30 = 60.

The total number of plant pots needed is the sum of D and R, which is D + R = 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April already bought 100 plant pots, we can find the number of plant pots she has left over by subtracting the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount Andrea saved, we need to calculate the difference between the initial amount of money she had and the amount she had after spending and giving her brother money.

Let's denote the initial amount as I, the amount spent on the sweater as S, and the amount given to her brother as B. We are given that I = $36, S = $11, and B = $4.

The amount Andrea had after spending and giving her brother money is I - S - B.

I - S - B = 36 - 11 - 4
I - S - B = 21

Since we want to find the amount Andrea saved, we need to find the difference between the initial amount and the amount she had after spending and giving her brother money.

Amount saved = I - (I - S - B)
Amount saved = I - I + S + B
Amount saved = S + B

Substituting the given values, we get:

Amount saved = 11 + 4
Amount saved = 15

"To determine the time John spent sightseeing, we need to calculate the total time spent on all activities and then find 40% of that total.

First, let's calculate the time spent on boating and swimming. Since John spent half the time swimming as he did boating, we can express this as:

Boating time = 6 hours
Swimming time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Next, we'll calculate the time spent watching shows. Since there were 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours, we can express this as:

Show time = 3 shows * 2 hours per show = 6 hours

Now, we can find the total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows:

Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows = Boating time + Swimming time + Show time
= 6 hours + 3 hours + 6 hours
= 15 hours

Since the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time, we can set up an equation to find the total time:

0.30 * Total time = 6 hours

To solve for Total time, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.30:

Total time = 6 hours / 0.30
Total time = 20 hours

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:

Time spent sightseeing = 0.40 * Total time
= 0.40 * 20 hours
= 8 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

Let's start by calculating her earnings from the first job, where she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work:

$$
\text{Earnings from first job} = 10 \times 20 = 200
$$

Next, we'll calculate her earnings from the second job, where she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work:

$$
\text{Earnings from second job} = 5 \times 15 = 75
$$

Now, we'll find her total earnings by adding her earnings from both jobs:

$$
\text{Total earnings} = 200 + 75 = 275
$$

Since Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, we'll subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone to find out how much more she needs to save:

$$
\text{Amount still needed} = 400 - 275 = 125
$$

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $125 to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $125"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. Let's start by identifying the heights of the three trees.

The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

Now, we need to find the combined height of the two shorter trees. This can be calculated as 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. Therefore, we can calculate it as 2 × (6 + 11) = 2 × 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the amount of money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount spent on toy cars and teddy bears, then subtract that from the total amount he has.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on toy cars: 6 toy cars * $2 = $12
Then, let's calculate the total amount spent on teddy bears: 5 teddy bears * $1 = $5
Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and teddy bears: $12 + $5 = $17

Dean initially received $28 and got an extra $10, so he now has $28 + $10 = $38
Finally, let's subtract the amount Dean spent from the total amount he has: $38 - $17 = $21

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and subtract it from her dad's budget.

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

However, we need to subtract Morgan's cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 
To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.83 ≈ 1

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the arcade tokens in the cost per friend. The cost per friend is actually $30 + $5 = $35. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $35 = 1.57

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.57 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $55 - $5 = $50. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$50 / $35 = 1.43

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.43 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the go-karts in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $50 - $20 = $30. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$30 / $35 = 0.86

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.86 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the mini-golf in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $30 - $5 = $25. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$25 / $35 = 0.71

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.71 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the arcade tokens in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $25 - $5 = $20. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$20 / $35 = 0.57

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.57 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $20 - $5 = $15.

$10 / $35 = 0.29

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.29 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the arcade tokens in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $10 - $5 = $5. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$5 / $35 = 0.14

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.14 ≈ 0

"To determine the amount Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate her daily savings and then multiply it by the number of days she saves.

First, let's calculate her daily savings. Marisa receives $5 as pocket money and spends $1 on lollipops. 

Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Cost of lollipops
Daily savings = $5 - $1
Daily savings = $4

Now, we need to find the total savings over 5 days.

Total savings = Daily savings x Number of days
Total savings = $4 x 5
Total savings = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. Let's start by determining the amount of money Billy had left after buying the candy.

Let's denote the amount of candy he bought as 'x' pounds. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the total cost of the candy is 1.5x.

Billy started with $10, so the amount of money he had left after buying the candy is:

10 - 1.5x

He then took half of this amount and spent it on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is:

40 \* 0.05 = 2

Since he took half of his change, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of (10 - 1.5x), which is:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2

We know that the amount he spent on gumballs is $2, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

So Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Given that Carver's age is 45 and it is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can express this relationship as an equation:

2x - 5 = 45

where 'x' represents the son's age. To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, add 5 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the negative term:

2x - 5 + 5 = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for 'x':

(2x) / 2 = 50 / 2
x = 25

Therefore, the son's age is 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"Given the scenario, we have a train traveling between three cities. The distances between the cities are as follows:

- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city to the first city: 175 - 50 = 125 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two segments)

To find the total distance traveled in one trip, we sum the individual distances:
75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is the product of the one-trip distance and the number of trips:
300 miles/trip × 3 trips/day = 900 miles/day

The train requires service every 18,000 miles. To determine the number of days between services, we divide the total distance between services by the daily distance:
18,000 miles ÷ 900 miles/day = 20 days

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the amount of stuffing needed for Mark's custom dog beds, we need to calculate the amount required for each type of bed and then sum them up.

First, let's find the amount of stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed, which is given as 8 pounds. A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing. To find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, we need to find the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed.

The average is calculated by adding the two values and dividing by 2: $\frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5$ pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. The amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds is $4 \times 2 = 8$ pounds. The amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds is $3 \times 5 = 15$ pounds.

To find the total amount of stuffing needed, we add the amount needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds: $8 + 15 = 23$ pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the total time taken for John's trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey and then sum them.

First, let's calculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. Using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, we get:

Time = 200 miles / 70 mph = 200/70 = 2.857 hours (approximately)

However, he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the total distance to his friend's house is 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles. The time taken to drive this distance at 70 mph is:

Time = 210 miles / 70 mph = 210/70 = 3 hours

Next, let's calculate the time taken to drive back home. The distance is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. Using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, we get:

Time = 240 miles / 80 mph = 240/80 = 3 hours

Now, we can find the total time taken for the trip by summing the times for each leg:

Total time = Time to friend's house + Time back home = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to calculate the number of students present and then find the difference between the total number of students and the number of girls.

Let's start by finding the total number of students present. We know that 96 fourth-graders were at the school initially, and 9 students were absent (5 girls and 4 boys). 

Total number of students present = Total number of fourth-graders - Total number of students absent
= 96 - 9
= 87

Next, we need to find the number of boys present. We know that 38 girls were present (since 43 girls were initially and 5 were absent). 

Number of boys present = Total number of students present - Number of girls present
= 87 - 38
= 49

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49.

The final answer is: 49"

Substituting the given value for G, we get B = 2(6) = 12. 

Now, to find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of boys and girls: Total = B + G = 12 + 6 = 18.

The points scored so far can be calculated as P1 + P2 = 15 + 18 = 33.

To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we subtract the points scored so far from the total required points: T - (P1 + P2) = 42 - 33 = 9.

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test is 9.

"Given the scenario, we have three distinct groups of individuals kicked out of the Walmart: those who refused to wear masks, those who were caught shoplifting, and those who engaged in physical violence. Let's denote the number of individuals in each group as M, S, and V, respectively.

We are given that M = 3. The number of individuals caught shoplifting, S, is four times the number of individuals who refused to wear masks minus 5. This can be expressed as:

S = 4M - 5
S = 4(3) - 5
S = 12 - 5
S = 7

Next, we are told that the number of individuals who engaged in physical violence, V, is three times the number of individuals caught shoplifting:

V = 3S
V = 3(7)
V = 21

We are also given that the total number of individuals kicked out is 50. Therefore, the sum of the individuals in each group is equal to 50:

M + S + V + O = 50

where O represents the number of individuals kicked out for other reasons. Substituting the values of M, S, and V into this equation, we get:

3 + 7 + 21 + O = 50

Combine like terms:

31 + O = 50

Subtract 31 from both sides:

O = 50 - 31
O = 19

Therefore, the number of individuals kicked out for other reasons is 19.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"Let's analyze the given information algebraically. 

Let E represent Erin's points before scoring 14 points, and S represent Sara's points. We are given that Sara scored 8 points, so S = 8. We also know that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, which can be expressed as E + 14 = 3S.

Substituting the value of S into the equation, we get E + 14 = 3(8). 

E + 14 = 24

To find E, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtracting 14 from both sides gives us:

E = 24 - 14
E = 10

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.

"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. The total cost of the picture frames is 44 \* 20 = $880.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the picture frames. The etching costs 20% of the cost of each frame, which is 0.20 \* 20 = $4 per frame. The total cost of etching is 44 \* 4 = $176.

Now, let's add the cost of the picture frames and the etching: $880 + $176 = $1056.

In addition to the picture frames and etching, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. The total cost of the pins is 2 \* 5 = $10.

Lastly, 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. The total cost of the cords is 11 \* 12 = $132.

To find the total cost of all the gifts, we add the cost of the picture frames and etching, the cost of the pins, and the cost of the cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"

"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

Let's start with the number of shoes sold on Friday: 14 pairs. 

On Saturday, the store sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday.

Total shoes sold on Sunday = 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold:
50 * 2 = 100

The final answer is: 100"

On Saturdays, she had twice as long as Tuesday's night class, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours: 1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours.

The total hours of dance practice per week is 5 hours."
"To calculate the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to determine the value of the faulty pieces and subtract it from the total amount spent.

The total amount spent is $400,000. 
The value of the faulty pieces is 40% of $400,000. To find 40% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.4 (since 40% = 40/100 = 0.4). 

So, the value of the faulty pieces is $400,000 * 0.4 = $160,000.

Now, subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total amount spent:
$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To determine the total milk collected, we need to calculate the milk from half of the sheep and the other half separately and then add them together.

Let's denote the total number of sheep as S, the milk from half of the sheep as M1, and the milk from the other half as M2. We are given that S = 30.

M1 = (1/2) * S = (1/2) * 30 = 15 kg

M2 = (1/2) * S = (1/2) * 30 = 15 kg

However, we are given that M2 is 2 kg per sheep. Therefore, M2 = 15 * 2 = 30 kg

Total milk collected = M1 + M2 = 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

The final answer is: 45"
"To determine the number of pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we need to calculate the total number of pieces after breaking the remaining rolls into 8 equal parts.

Let's start by identifying the initial number of rolls, which is a dozen, denoted as 12. After feeding 6 children, the remaining number of rolls can be calculated as follows:

12 (initial rolls) - 6 (rolls fed to children) = 6 (remaining rolls)

Now, we need to find the total number of pieces after breaking each of the remaining rolls into 8 equal parts. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of remaining rolls by the number of pieces per roll:

6 (remaining rolls) × 8 (pieces per roll) = 48

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we find the number of pupils who like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 40 = 20$ pupils.

Next, we find the number of pupils who like green. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{4} \cdot (40 - 20) = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 20 = 5$ pupils.

Now, we need to find the total number of pupils who like blue and green. This is simply the sum of the two groups: $20 + 5 = 25$ pupils.

Finally, to find the number of pupils who like yellow, we subtract the total number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils: $40 - 25 = 15$ pupils.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. Let's start by analyzing the information given:

- On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples picked and earned $56 at $4 per piece. This means she picked 14 apples on Monday, as 56 ÷ 4 = 14.

Now, let's consider the apples picked on Tuesday and Wednesday. We know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we simply add the number of apples picked on each day:
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed and subtract that from the total number of socks that need washing.

First, let's calculate the number of socks from the pairs. Since each pair consists of 2 socks, 10 pairs of socks is equivalent to 10 x 2 = 20 socks.

Next, we add the 15 loose socks to the total number of socks from the pairs. This gives us 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Now, we subtract the total number of socks Lindsay has washed from the total number of socks that need washing: 50 - 35 = 15.

Therefore, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."

Next, we need to subtract the number of cookies her brother ate from the total number of cookies. This is a simple subtraction problem:

65 (total cookies) - 44 (cookies eaten by brother) = 21

Therefore, the number of cookies left for Rachel is 21."
"To determine the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest and then divide it by the number of months. The formula for total interest is given by:

Total Interest = Principal × Rate × Time

Given:
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (r) = 10% or 0.10
Time (t) = 5 months

Total Interest = P × r × t
= $3,650 × 0.10 × 5
= $1,825

The total amount to be paid is the principal plus the interest:
Total Amount = P + Total Interest
= $3,650 + $1,825
= $5,475

To find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months

"To determine the profit per hour Millie makes from her lemonade stand, we need to calculate the total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she operates the stand.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she purchased. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 × 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

The revenue from selling all the lemonade is the number of cups sold multiplied by the price per cup, which is $1. Therefore, the total revenue is 36 × $1 = $36.

The cost of the supplies is $18. To find the total profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she can make 36 cups in total, she will spend 36 ÷ 4 = 9 hours selling all the lemonade.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 ÷ 9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can set up the equation:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had is 32 hectares.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the number of people who sang in the performance, we first need to find the number of girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are girls, we can calculate this as 0.5 * 52 = 26 girls.

Next, we need to find the number of girls who couldn't make it to the show. Since half the people performing can't make it, we can calculate this as 0.5 * 26 = 13 girls.

Now, we need to find the total number of people performing. This is the number of girls minus the number of girls who couldn't make it, plus the number of teachers. So, the total number of people performing is 26 - 13 + 3 = 16.

The total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36."
"To determine the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can express this relationship as a fraction.

Let's denote the number of messages to Ms. Thompson as M. Then, the number of messages to Mr. Yu is (1/3)M.

Given that M = 66, we can substitute this value into the expression for the number of messages to Mr. Yu:

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3)M
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3)(66)
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can find the total number of messages James delivers by adding the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:

Total messages = M + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22

"Given the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, we can express this as a fraction, 5/11, representing the proportion of popsicles each person has. The total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

To find the number of popsicles each person has, we can use the concept of proportions. We set up the equation:

(5/11) * Total = Betty's popsicles
(6/11) * Total = Sam's popsicles

Substituting the given total, we get:

(5/11) * 165 = Betty's popsicles
(6/11) * 165 = Sam's popsicles

Simplifying the expressions, we get:

Betty's popsicles = (5/11) * 165 = 75
Sam's popsicles = (6/11) * 165 = 90

Now, to find the difference in the number of popsicles between Sam and Betty, we subtract the number of Betty's popsicles from Sam's popsicles:

Difference = Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles = 90 - 75 = 15

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus individually is $10 each, but since Tim bundles them, he saves 20% on the combined cost. To find the bundled cost, we first need to calculate the discount amount.

The discount is 20% of the combined cost of Hulu and Disney Plus, which is $10 + $10 = $20. To find 20% of $20, we multiply $20 by 0.20.

20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

Now, we subtract the discount from the combined cost to find the bundled cost.

Bundled cost = $20 - $4 = $16

The total cost of the streaming services is the sum of the cost of Netflix and the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus.

Total cost = $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26

To find the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package.

Amount saved = $60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34

The final answer is: $34"

Time spent writing: 4 hours
Time spent recording: 4 / 2 = 2 hours
Time spent editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Total time spent = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the percentage of time spent editing by dividing the time spent editing by the total time and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

Therefore, the percentage of time spent editing is 20%."
"To determine the total number of books Wendy needs to carry, we can start by finding the total capacity of the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, we can represent this as a 6x6 grid. The total number of books in the system can be calculated as the product of the number of rows and columns:

6 rows * 6 columns = 6 * 6 = 36 books

Now, we need to find double the number of books in the system. This can be represented as 2 * 36 = 2(6 * 6) = 2(6) * 6 = 12 * 6 = 72 books.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so we add 20 to the result:

72 + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92 books

Therefore, Wendy needs to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"To determine the total number of Valentine's cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Let's start by calculating the total number of cards Erica initially had. She made 20 Valentine's cards.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she got 2 * 15 = 30 cards from her dad.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica had before passing any out. This is the sum of the cards she initially made and the cards her dad brought: 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

Next, we need to subtract the cards she passed out. She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so the total number of cards she gave away is 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, let's subtract the cards she gave away from the total number of cards she had: 50 - 29 = 21 cards.

Finally, we need to add the cards she received from family and friends. She received 17 cards, so the total number of cards she has now is 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

"To determine the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

The number of millipedes is 1/3 of the number of spiders. Given that there are 90 spiders, we can express this as a fraction: 90/3. To simplify this, we divide the numerator by the denominator: 90 ÷ 3 = 30. Therefore, there are 30 millipedes.

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs. We are told that this number is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. We can express this as an equation: 2 × 30 - 12. To evaluate this, we first multiply 2 by 30, which equals 60. Then, we subtract 12 from this result: 60 - 12 = 48. Therefore, there are 48 stink bugs.

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs: 90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168.

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we must first calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the amount of each ingredient by 4.

Total flour required = 3 cups/batch * 4 batches = 12 cups
Total milk required = 1 cup/batch * 4 batches = 4 cups

Given that flour is sold in 2-cup bags and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we can calculate the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy by dividing the total amount of each ingredient by the amount in each container.

Number of bags of flour = Total flour required / Flour in each bag = 12 cups / 2 cups/bag = 6 bags
Number of bottles of milk = Total milk required / Milk in each bottle = 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles

To find the difference between the number of bags of flour and the number of bottles of milk, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour.

Difference = Number of bags of flour - Number of bottles of milk = 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4 bags

Therefore, Mark needs to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"To determine the energy saved by Mel, we need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner in both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the original energy used per day. The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour, and Mel uses it for 8 hours a day. We can express this as:

Energy (kWh) = Power (W) × Time (h)
= 900 W × 8 h
= 7200 Wh
= 7.2 kWh

Now, let's calculate the new energy used per day after reducing the usage by 5 hours. The air conditioner is used for 3 hours a day, so:

Energy (kWh) = Power (W) × Time (h)
= 900 W × 3 h
= 2700 Wh
= 2.7 kWh

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new energy used:

Energy saved (kWh) = Original energy (kWh) - New energy (kWh)
= 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh
= 4.5 kWh

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30:

Total energy saved (kWh) = Energy saved (kWh) × Number of days
= 4.5 kWh/day × 30 days
= 135 kWh

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we need to calculate the total number of stripes and divide it by the total number of zebras.

Let's start by calculating the total number of stripes. We have two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. We also have one zebra with 36 stripes. Additionally, there is another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese for the muffaletta sandwiches, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people.

Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Now, we calculate the total pounds of meat and cheese needed, as each sandwich requires 1 pound of each:

Total pounds of meat = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds
Total pounds of cheese = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds

Next, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:

Cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
Cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:

"Let's denote the initial number of cannolis as C and the initial number of corns as 2C, since there are twice as many corns as cannolis. We are given that C = 40.

The initial number of corns is 2C = 2(40) = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. The number of corns bought is 2(60) - 40 = 80.

Now, we can find the total number of corns and cannolis after the purchase:

Total corns = Initial corns + Corns bought = 80 + 80 = 160
Total cannolis = Initial cannolis + Cannolis bought = 40 + 60 = 100

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 160 + 100 = 260.

The final answer is: $\boxed{260}$"
"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to calculate the total steps he completed before his jog and then subtract the remaining steps from his daily goal.

Elliott's daily goal is 10,000 steps. He completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. Therefore, the total steps completed before his jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since Elliott had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find the number of steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he had left to complete before his jog.

Steps taken during jog = Steps left to complete - Steps left after jog
= 4,000 - 2,000
= 2,000

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be at the airport, we need to calculate the total time it takes for him to read the book and travel to the airport.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to read the book. The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 * 200 = 9000 words. Given Toby's reading rate of 300 words per minute, the time it takes to read the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Next, we need to add the time it takes to get to the airport, which is 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes for Toby to read the book and travel to the airport is 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes.

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, we can find out how many minutes early he will be by subtracting the time he arrives from the time he has to be there: 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to determine the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

Let's start by calculating the total amount paid in May. The company hired 40 employees, and each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks. The total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. Therefore, the total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount paid in June. Since 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. Therefore, the total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

$168,000"
"To determine the amount of money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

The taffy sale can be broken down into two parts: the first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which is equivalent to 1/2 × $3 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

The cost of the mixed bag of seashells is $1.50, and the 4 magnets cost 4 × $0.25 = $1.

To find the total cost of the items, we add the costs together: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so we subtract the total cost from her initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To calculate the total amount spent on fireworks, we need to consider the cost of the two packages and the finale firework. The first package costs $400, and the second package is twice that amount, which is 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is the sum of the two packages: $400 + $800 = $1200.

To apply the 20% discount, we calculate the discount amount as a percentage of the total cost: 20% of $1200 = 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the fireworks is the original cost minus the discount: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent is the sum of the discounted fireworks and the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she will consume in 30 days. This can be found by multiplying the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights.

Let's denote the number of cookies she eats per night as c = 2, and the number of nights as n = 30. The total number of cookies she will consume is given by the product of these two values:

c * n = 2 * 30 = 60

Since her recipe yields 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find the number of dozens she needs:

Total cookies / Dozen cookies = 60 / 12 = 5

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to consider the intersection of the two conditions.

Let's denote the total number of candles as N = 50000. The probability that a candle smells like wet dog is p(WD) = 0.05, and the probability that a candle is more dangerous (i.e., has a 99% guarantee not to explode) is p(D) = 0.01.

We are interested in finding the probability that a candle both smells like wet dog and is more dangerous, which is the joint probability p(WD ∩ D). Since the events are independent, we can use the formula for the intersection of two independent events:

p(WD ∩ D) = p(WD) × p(D)

Substituting the given values, we get:

p(WD ∩ D) = 0.05 × 0.01 = 0.0005

To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are more dangerous, we multiply the joint probability by the total number of candles:

Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode = p(WD ∩ D) × N
= 0.0005 × 50000
= 25

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25."
"To calculate the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to determine the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which can be calculated as 0.3 * $20 = $6.

To find the discounted price of each blouse, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price: $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic equations.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as T, from the shortest trees as S, and from the average trees as A. We are given that T = 30.

Since Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, we have S = T/2 = 30/2 = 15.

We are also given that her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 2T = 2(30) = 60 apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3S = 3(15) = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is T + S + A, and the total number of apples gathered by her sister is 2T + 3S. We are given that the combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can write the equation:

T + S + A + 2T + 3S = 500

Substituting the values of T and S, we get:

30 + 15 + A + 2(30) + 3(15) = 500

Combine like terms:

30 + 15 + 60 + 45 + A = 500

Simplify:

150 + A = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

A = 350

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"Given the problem, we have a system of linear equations representing the number of camels and dromedaries in the herd. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We are given two equations based on the total number of heads and the total number of bumps:

C + D = 180  ... (Equation 1)
2C + D = 304  ... (Equation 2)

To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of elimination. Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2 eliminates the variable D:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we have the value of C, we can substitute it into Equation 1 to find the value of D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, the number of dromedaries in the herd is 56.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To calculate the total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the journey into manageable segments and apply the given information.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days. Since Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, the total distance covered in this period is:

$$\text{Distance in first 4 days} = 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}$$

Next, we're told that over the next two days, he traveled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. To find this distance, we'll calculate 30% of 800 km:

$$\text{Distance in next 2 days} = \left(\frac{30}{100}\right) \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km}$$

On the next day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance covered is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:

$$\text{Distance in second week} = 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}$$

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each segment of the trip:

$$\text{Total distance} = 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{3140}$"
"Given the problem, we can start by analyzing the relationship between the lockers' sizes. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Zack's locker size, we can multiply Peter's locker size by 4, as 4 is the reciprocal of 1/4.

4 × 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches (Zack's locker size)

Now, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. To find Timothy's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2, as 2 is the reciprocal of 1/2.

2 × 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches (Timothy's locker size)

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb is, we need to determine the difference between Stanley's initial elevation and the distance the comb fell. This is a straightforward subtraction problem.

Let's denote Stanley's initial elevation as S = 10,000 feet and the distance the comb fell as d = 4,000 feet. The elevation of the comb can be calculated as:

S - d = 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb. Let's denote Oliver's elevation as O = 3,000 feet. The distance Oliver must climb can be calculated as:

Distance = S - d - O = 10,000 - 4,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To determine the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to calculate the amount of money he received from the banks and add it to his initial capital.

Let's denote the amount received from the first bank as $B1 and the amount received from the second bank as $B2. We know that B1 = $4000 and B2 = 2 * B1 = 2 * $4000 = $8000.

The total amount received from the banks is B1 + B2 = $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Now, we can calculate the total capital Mr. Josue has now by adding the initial capital to the amount received from the banks: Initial Capital + Total Amount from Banks = $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"To determine the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.
3. Now, the number of cats left on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30.
4. 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we multiply 3/5 by 30: $\frac{3}{5} \cdot 30 = \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{30}{1} = \frac{3 \cdot 30}{5 \cdot 1} = \frac{90}{5} = 18$.
5. The number of cats left on the rock is the remaining cats minus the cats that ran after the mouse: $30 - 18 = 12$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different price periods and calculate the cost for each period.

The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 \* 8 = $48.

The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 \* 12 = $96.

The remaining months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months) were $14 a month, so the cost for this period is 10 \* 14 = $140.

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Given the problem, we can approach it by first defining the variables and establishing the relationships between them. Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J.

We are given that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so we can express this relationship as:

J = T - 6

We also know that the total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and 2/3 from the tattered jeans. This can be represented as:

(1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6

To solve for the cost of the tattered jeans, we can substitute the expression for J from the first equation into the second equation:

(1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction yields:

T - 6 + 2T = 18

Combining like terms, we get:

3T - 6 = 18

Adding 6 to both sides gives us:

3T = 24

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

T = 8

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans by substituting T into the first equation:

J = T - 6
J = 8 - 6
J = 2

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and sum them together.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 × 60 = 240 employees.

The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 × 30 = 180 employees.

The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 × 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570.

The final answer is: 570"
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

We know that Lillian made 3 homemade feeders and bought 3 store-bought feeders. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted to the homemade and store-bought feeders, which is 3(x + 10) + 3x.

Simplifying the expression, we get 3x + 30 + 3x = 6x + 30.

We also know that each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds. Since there are 3 store-bought feeders, the total number of birds attracted to them is 3 * 20 = 60.

Setting 6x + 30 equal to 60, we can solve for x:

6x + 30 = 60

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

6x = 30

Dividing both sides by 6:

x = 5

Now that we know x = 5, we can find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

6x + 30 = 6(5) + 30 = 30 + 30 = 60

However, this is the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders. We also need to add the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders, which is 3(x + 10) = 3(5 + 10) = 3(15) = 45.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 + 45 = 105.

The final answer is: 105"
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which is $4. To calculate 25% of $4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 4 × 0.25 = $1. Then, we add this amount to the cost of the bagel: 4 + 1 = $5.

Next, we need to find the cost of the cake. The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is 4 ÷ 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as x.

Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, so the number of cards he kept is (1/3)x. He sold the remaining 2/3 of the cards, which is equivalent to 2x/3. We know that he sold these cards for $1.5 each and made a total of $50.

We can set up the equation:

(2/3)x * $1.5 = $50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to eliminate the fraction:

(2/3)x * (3/2) * $1.5 = $50 * (3/2)

This simplifies to:

x * $1.5 = $75

Now, we can divide both sides by $1.5 to solve for x:

x = $75 / $1.5

x = 50

Therefore, Kenny started with 50 cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog when 40 guests showed up and everyone wanted a second hotdog.

First, let's calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared. The caterer prepared enough for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs, which is 18 guests. This means 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs were prepared for these 18 guests. For the other half of the guests (also 18), the caterer prepared 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs. Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is 36 + 18 = 54.

However, when 40 guests showed up, each guest wanted a second hotdog. This means a total of 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs were needed.

Since there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, we can calculate the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog by finding the difference between the number of hotdogs needed and the number of hotdogs prepared: 80 - 54 = 26.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog is 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we need to calculate the number of letters in her sister's name first.

Let's denote the number of letters in Indras' name as I = 6. 

The number of letters in her sister's name is 4 more than half of the letters in Indras' name. Therefore, the number of letters in her sister's name is (I / 2) + 4.

Substituting the value of I, we get (6 / 2) + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name: I + (I / 2) + 4 = 6 + 7 = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to apply the concept of percentage discount to the total cost of the items.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

1. Set of pot and pans: $120.00
2. Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
3. 5 separate utensils: 5 x $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost before discount: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, let's calculate the discount amount:
Discount = 20% of $165.00
Discount = 0.20 x $165.00
Discount = $33.00

To find the total cost after the discount, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount:
Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount
Total cost after discount = $165.00 - $33.00
Total cost after discount = $132.00

Therefore, the total cost of Charlotte's order after the 20% discount is $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To determine the amount of money Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball, we must first calculate the total cost of the items. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. 

The total cost of the items is calculated as follows: $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Dora has a total of $18, which is the sum of her allowance of $2 and the money her mother gave her, $16.

To find the amount of money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to calculate the number of dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter slew first.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who slew 100 dragons. To find three quarters of 100, we can multiply 100 by 3/4, which is equivalent to 100 × (3 ÷ 4) or 100 × 0.75. This gives us 100 × 0.75 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so we multiply the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew by 2: 75 × 2 = 150 dragons.

Now, we need to find one-fifth of the number of dragons Prince Walter slew. To do this, we can multiply 150 by 1/5, which is equivalent to 150 ÷ 5 or 150 × 0.2. This gives us 150 × 0.2 = 30 dragons.

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the amount of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how much gas was in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the volume of each container by dividing the total volume by the number of containers.

15 gallons ÷ 5 containers = 3 gallons/container

Now, we need to convert the volume from gallons to pints. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. Therefore, we can convert 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8.

3 gallons × 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints/container

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we can calculate the volume of gasoline she needed by multiplying the volume of one container by 1/4.

1/4 × 24 pints = 6 pints

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic equations.

Let's denote the number of candy bars George bought as x. Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the total amount spent on candy bars is 0.75x dollars.

We know that George spent $5 in total and had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money. This can be represented as:

0.99(5) = 1.20 + 0.75x

Simplifying the equation:

4.95 = 1.20 + 0.75x

Subtracting 1.20 from both sides:

3.75 = 0.75x

Dividing both sides by 0.75:

x = 5

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to perform a simple division operation. 

First, we subtract the number of lollipops Ray kept from the total number of lollipops he had: 25 - 5 = 20.

Next, we divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends: 20 ÷ 4 = 5.

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to determine the weight of the portion consumed by Rory and her mom. Since the cake is cut into 8 equal pieces, we can calculate the weight of each piece by dividing the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces.

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Given that both Rory and her mom each have a piece, we can calculate the total weight of the cake they consumed.

Total weight eaten = 2 * Weight of each piece
Total weight eaten = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

Now, we can find the weight of the remaining cake by subtracting the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of oranges each person will receive, we must first calculate the total number of oranges available for distribution. Sitti and Juris collectively possess 34 and 22 oranges, respectively.

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since they intend to share these oranges equally among themselves and their 6 friends, we must calculate the total number of individuals involved in the distribution. This includes Sitti, Juris, and the 6 friends, totaling 8 individuals.

To find the number of oranges each person will receive, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:
56 ÷ 8 = 7

Therefore, each person will receive 7 oranges."
"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

First, let's calculate the cost of the onions. Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, we can calculate the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings: $12.00 ÷ 6 = $2.00.

The cost per serving is $2.00.

"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then add 5 minutes to it.

Let's denote the time it takes Wayne to get to the theater as W. We are given that W = 4 minutes.

Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, we can express the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater as 4W. Substituting W = 4, we get 4W = 4(4) = 16 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time Bernadette needs to leave before Wayne. Since Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne's arrival time. Therefore, Bernadette needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne arrives at the theater.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"Given the area of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 360 square feet and the length of his room is 3 yards, we need to find the perimeter of the room in feet. 

First, we convert the length from yards to feet, as 1 yard equals 3 feet. Therefore, 3 yards is equivalent to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
\[ A = l \times w \]
where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width:
\[ w = \frac{A}{l} \]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[ w = \frac{360}{9} \]
\[ w = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (l + w) \]
Substituting the values, we get:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 49 \]
\[ P = 98 \text{ feet} \]

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we need to calculate the total number of beads each has.

Elizabeth purchased 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, we can calculate the total number of beads she has as follows:

1 pack of red beads = 1 × 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 × 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth purchased 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, we can calculate the total number of beads she has as follows:

3 packs of blue beads = 3 × 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 × 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we can find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:

Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to consider the temperature changes due to the oven and the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. This can be represented as:

ΔT_oven = 5°/h * 3 h = 15°

Next, we need to calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The window is open for 0.5 hours (30 minutes), and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is equivalent to 0.5 hours. The cooling rate is 2°/10 min, which is equivalent to 0.2°/min. Therefore, the temperature decrease due to the open window is:

ΔT_window = 0.2°/min * 30 min = 6°

Now, we can calculate the final temperature of the house by adding the initial temperature to the temperature increase due to the oven and subtracting the temperature decrease due to the open window:

T_final = T_initial + ΔT_oven - ΔT_window
= 40° + 15° - 6°
= 49°

The final answer is: 49"
"To determine the time it took James to complete the run, we need to first calculate his total time for the triathlon. 

Let's start by converting Jon's times into minutes: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to swim and bike. 
- James' swim time is 10% faster than Jon's, so it is 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes.
- James' bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, so it is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to run. 
Total time for James: 180 minutes
Time for James to swim and bike: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes
Time for James to run: 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

The final answer is: 59"
"To determine the length of Movie A, we need to convert the given time for Movie C to minutes and then calculate the length of Movie B and Movie A.

First, we convert 1.25 hours to minutes: 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C: 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes.

Now, we know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide the length of Movie B by 4: 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes.

Therefore, the length of Movie A is 20 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount of hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance it runs. Given that the horse runs for 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour, we must first convert the time from minutes to hours.

Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, we can convert 30 minutes to hours as follows:

30 minutes = 30/60 hours = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs using the formula:

Distance = Speed * Time
= 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours
= 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat a total of:

8 bails of hay (since 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails)

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is:

8 bails * $3/bail = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

6 * $5 = $30

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has:

$30 - $24 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she has and then divide that by the number of eggs required per glass, and finally divide by the number of glasses per tray.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs. Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs in cases, which is equivalent to 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, she has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many glasses she can make with 50 eggs. Since each glass requires 5 eggs, the total number of glasses is 50 / 5 = 10.

Now, we know that each tray holds 5 glasses. To find the number of trays, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses per tray: 10 / 5 = 2.

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the difference in points between Joey and Marcy after their turns, we need to calculate their respective totals.

Joey's initial points: 214
Points scored by Joey: 26
Joey's total points after his turn: 214 + 26 = 240

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points scored by Marcy: 10
Marcy's total points after her turn: 225 + 10 = 235

Now, we can find the difference between their totals by subtracting Marcy's total from Joey's total.

Difference: 240 - 235 = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to determine the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is given by the product of the number of sneakers sold and the price per sneaker: 17 \* 20 = $340.

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:
There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and they were sold for $25 each. The revenue from the department store sale is given by the product of the number of sneakers sold and the price per sneaker: 31 \* 25 = $775.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale: $340 + $775 = $1115.

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue: $1115 - $576 = $539.

The final answer is: $539"

Next, we calculate the number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each: 4 × 16 = 64.

Now, we add the number of crayons in both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, the total number of crayons Beatrice bought is 112.

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as $p and the regular price of the soda as $s. We are given that the soda costs $3, so s = 3.

We are also given that the super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra. This means that the cost of the super ticket is equal to the cost of a regular ticket plus the cost of the soda and popcorn, minus the $1 discount. However, we are not given the cost of a regular ticket, but we are given that if we buy a regular ticket and don't buy the super ticket, we save $2.

"To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. Let's denote the original cost as x. The total cost of filling 20 balloons is $900, so we can set up the equation 20x = 900.

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: x = 900 / 20 = 45.

This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45. Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65.

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. Multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by 170: 65 × 170 = 11050.

The final answer is: 11050"
"Calculating average speed is a fundamental concept in kinematics, and it's essential to understand the relationship between distance, time, and speed. In this scenario, we have a car that travels at two different speeds: 60 mph for 2 hours and 30 mph for 1 hour.

To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. The distance traveled at each speed is given by the product of the speed and time:

Distance1 = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles
Distance2 = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles

The total distance traveled is the sum of these two distances:

Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the individual times:

Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

Therefore, the average speed of the car during this trip is 50 mph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Let's denote the initial number of sapphires as S = 8 and the initial number of rubies as R = 0. Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so the new number of sapphires is S - 3 and the new number of rubies is R + 2.

The value of a sapphire is $800 and the value of a ruby is $1200. Therefore, the total value of the sapphires is 800(S - 3) and the total value of the rubies is 1200(R + 2).

We can calculate the value of the sapphires she has left: 800(8 - 3) = 800(5) = $4000.

We can calculate the value of the rubies she received: 1200(0 + 2) = 1200(2) = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is the sum of the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To determine the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate their combined daily consumption and then multiply it by the number of days.

Their combined daily consumption is the sum of their individual daily consumption, which is 4 apples per day each. Therefore, their combined daily consumption is 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply their combined daily consumption by the number of days to find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days:

8 apples/day × 30 days = 8 × 30 = 240 apples

The final answer is: 240"
"To determine the cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The dimensions of each bed are given as 2 feet in width, 8 feet in length, and 2 feet in height. 

The volume of a rectangular prism, such as a raised bed, is calculated using the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. 

Substituting the given values, we get V = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 10 * 32 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags required is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

The cost of each bag is $12, so the total cost is 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we need to determine the number of green cards first. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can express this as an equation:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + (60% of Number of red cards)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

The total number of cards is the sum of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of fairies remaining, we need to break down the sequence of events.

Initially, Katelyn observed 50 fairies. 

Twenty minutes later, her friend witnessed half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the existing group. This can be expressed as 50 / 2 = 25 fairies joining the group.

The total number of fairies now is the sum of the initial fairies and the new fairies: 50 + 25 = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. To find the number of fairies remaining, we subtract the number of fairies that flew away from the total: 75 - 30 = 45.

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is 45.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to calculate the ratio of puppies with spots to the total number of puppies. 

First, let's determine the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 

Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.

Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, the correct answer is 35%."
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make to transport the feed, we must first calculate the total weight of the feed. 

The weight of the sugar cubes is 2 pounds, the carrots weigh 48 pounds, the hay weighs 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds, and the oats weigh 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds. 

The total weight of the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips.

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511

Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To determine Grayson's monthly earnings from recycling, we need to calculate the total value of the cans and bottles she recycles in a month.

First, let's find the weekly earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles:

Aluminum cans: 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week
Plastic bottles: 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Now, we add the weekly earnings from both sources:
6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4 to find the monthly earnings:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month

Therefore, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the number of plants Shondra has, we need to calculate the number of plants Toni has first. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can express this as an equation:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has by subtracting 7 from Toni's total:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the amount Ali has now, we need to calculate the amount Leila gave him and add it to the amount he already had.

Leila gave Ali half of her $100, which is calculated as follows:

$$\frac{100}{2} = 50$$

So, Leila gave Ali $50.

Ali already had $21. 

To find the total amount Ali has now, we add the amount he received from Leila to the amount he already had:

$$21 + 50 = 71$$

Therefore, the final amount Ali has is $71."
"To determine the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to calculate 1/5 of the cost of the pizza and add it to the cost of the pizza.

The cost of the pizza is $15. To find 1/5 of this amount, we can multiply the cost by 1/5, which is equivalent to dividing by 5.

Tip = (1/5) × $15
Tip = $15 ÷ 5
Tip = $3

Now, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man.

Total amount = Cost of the pizza + Tip
Total amount = $15 + $3
Total amount = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine Finley's final position in the 100-meter race, we can track her movements step by step.

Initially, Finley starts in 1st place. 

She then falls back 5 spots, which means she moves to the 6th position. This can be represented as:

1 - 5 = 6

Next, she moves ahead 2 spots, placing her in the 4th position. This can be represented as:

6 - 2 = 4

However, she then falls behind 3 spots, which means she moves to the 7th position. This can be represented as:

4 + 3 = 7

Finally, she jumps ahead 1 spot to finish the race, placing her in the 6th position. This can be represented as:

7 - 1 = 6

Therefore, Finley finishes the race in the 6th position.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the number of students Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she has and then divide that by the number of cards each student receives.

First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards. Since Miss Maria has 6 decks with 25 cards in each deck, we can express this as 6 × 25 = 150.

Next, we calculate the total number of baseball cards. With 5 boxes containing 40 cards in each box, we can express this as 5 × 40 = 200.

Now, we add the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards to find the overall number of cards: 150 + 200 = 350.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, we subtract this from the total number of cards to find the number of cards she gives to her students: 350 - 50 = 300.

Finally, we divide the number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student receives to find the number of students: 300 ÷ 10 = 30.

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the difference in the amount Kelly paid compared to Becky, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples for each of them after applying the respective discounts.

Becky's cost per apple: $0.45
Number of apples: 20
Total cost: 20 * $0.45 = $9.00
Discount: $1.00
Becky's total cost: $9.00 - $1.00 = $8.00

Kelly's cost per apple: $0.50
Number of apples: 20
Total cost: 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
Discount: 10% of $10.00 = 0.10 * $10.00 = $1.00
Kelly's total cost: $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount Kelly paid compared to Becky.
Difference: $9.00 - $8.00 = $1.00

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to establish the ratio of laundry items per room. 

Each room has 2 sheets, 1 comforter, 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases, and 2 * 4 = 8 towels. The total number of items per room is the sum of these: 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15.

Now, we can multiply the total number of items per room by the total number of rooms to find the total number of pieces of laundry: 15 * 80 = 1200.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1200}$"
"To determine the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has after gaining new pairs and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of on Saturday.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he acquires 5 pairs of shoes, which is equivalent to 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
4. On Friday, he acquires 30 new pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of shoes he has after gaining new pairs:

200 (initial shoes) + 10 (shoes from Monday) + 30 (shoes from Wednesday) + 60 (shoes from Friday) = 300 shoes

However, on Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. To find the total number of shoes he has on Sunday, we subtract the shoes he got rid of from the total:

300 (total shoes) - 180 (shoes gotten rid of) = 120 shoes

Therefore, Fireman Frank has 120 shoes on Sunday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the number of pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles she has. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, we can find the total number of cupcakes by multiplying the number of jars by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate.

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Now, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she needs to bake to have at least 48 cupcakes. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we can divide 48 by 12 to get the number of pans.

48 ÷ 12 = 4

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes."
"To determine the amount of change Theo received, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased and subtract that from the amount she paid.

The cost of the pen is $2. The cost of the paper is $1 less than three times the price of the pen, which can be expressed as 3 × 2 - 1 = $5.

The total cost of the pen and the paper is $2 + $5 = $7.

Since Theo gave the cashier $10, the change she received is $10 - $7 = $3.

Therefore, the amount of change Theo received is $3."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. 

First, we calculate the total number of pencils initially in the class. Since there are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils, we can express this as a product of the number of students and the number of pencils per student:

Total pencils initially = 30 students × 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

Next, we determine the number of pencils used after two months. We are given that 1/5 of the total pencils were used. To find this, we multiply the total pencils by the fraction 1/5:

Pencils used = 300 pencils × (1/5) = 300 × 1/5 = 60 pencils

Now, we calculate the remaining pencils after two months by subtracting the pencils used from the initial total:

Remaining pencils after two months = 300 pencils - 60 pencils = 240 pencils

Finally, we need to find the number of pencils left at the end of the year. We are told that only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find this, we multiply the remaining pencils by the fraction 1/3:

Pencils left = 240 pencils × (1/3) = 240 × 1/3 = 80 pencils

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, the number of carrot sticks Matt has to eat is 6."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet, as the shark's length is given in feet.

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet
2 remoras = 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras.

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras occupies 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Given that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home, we can express this as an equation. Let 'x' represent the total number of students. The number of students without a desktop computer is one-fourth of the total, which is given as 20. We can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4 to isolate x:

x = 20 * 4

x = 80

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine how many days Jason has to walk in total to break in his new shoes, we need to calculate the total number of days he has available in three weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply 3 weeks by 7 days/week.

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

However, Jason can only walk 4 days a week. To find out how many days he has to walk in total, we need to divide the total number of days by 4.

21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4

"To determine the number of books each child received, we need to calculate the total number of books purchased and then divide that by the number of children.

Given that the total amount spent on books is $300 and each book costs $15, we can calculate the total number of books as follows:

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 ÷ $15
Total number of books = 300/15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah distributed the books equally among her 4 children, we can find the number of books each child received by dividing the total number of books by 4:

Number of books each child got = Total number of books ÷ 4
Number of books each child got = 20 ÷ 4
Number of books each child got = 5

Therefore, each child received 5 books.

The final answer is: 5"
"Given the scenario, we can apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion from set theory to determine the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything. Let's denote the set of kids allergic to dairy as D, the set of kids allergic to peanuts as P, and the set of kids allergic to both as D ∩ P.

We know that |D| = 9, |P| = 6, and |D ∩ P| = 3. The total number of kids in the class is 32.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can calculate the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts as:

|D ∪ P| = |D| + |P| - |D ∩ P|
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class:

|not allergic| = |total kids| - |D ∪ P|
= 32 - 12
= 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and add the number of tour guides.

Next, we calculate the total number of tour guides by multiplying the number of groups by the number of tour guides per group: 3 groups * 7 tour guides/group = 21 tour guides.

Now, we add the total number of employees and tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour: 600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621 people.

The final answer is: 621"
"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to consider the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, so for two people, the total cost is 2 × $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the new price, we calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.20 × $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price to get the new price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 × $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"
"To determine the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he possesses.

Let's start by calculating the number of tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, we can express this relationship as:

Jasper's blue paint = (1/2) * Ben's blue paint
Jasper's blue paint = (1/2) * 4
Jasper's blue paint = 2

Next, we'll calculate the number of tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, and Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. This relationship can be expressed as:

Jasper's yellow paint = 3 * Ben's yellow paint
Jasper's yellow paint = 3 * 3
Jasper's yellow paint = 9

Now, we can find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has by adding the number of blue and yellow paint tubes:

Total paint = Jasper's blue paint + Jasper's yellow paint
Total paint = 2 + 9
Total paint = 11

"Given that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can express this relationship as a mathematical equation. Let's denote the weight of the 1959 penny as x. Then, the weight of the 2010 penny is (3/4)x.

We are given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. Therefore, we can substitute x = 48 into the equation for the weight of the 2010 penny:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 = 36 grains

Now, to find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weights of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 + 36
Combined weight = 84 grains

"To determine the amount Keegan and Tasha need to earn to reach their goal, we must first calculate the total amount they have already earned. This can be done by adding the individual earnings of Keegan and Tasha.

Let's denote Keegan's earnings as K and Tasha's earnings as T. We are given that K = $83 and T = $91. Therefore, the total amount earned is K + T = $83 + $91 = $174.

Now, to find the amount they need to earn to reach their goal, we subtract the total amount earned from the goal amount. The goal amount is $200. So, the amount needed to reach the goal is $200 - $174 = $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To determine the difference in the number of songs Luri and Gabriel can add to their players, we first need to calculate the number of songs each can add. 

Let's denote the capacity of the portable media player as C = 100 songs. Gabriel currently has 20 songs, so the number of songs he can add is C - 20 = 100 - 20 = 80.

Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs. Therefore, the number of songs Luri can add is C - 60 = 100 - 60 = 40.

The difference between the number of songs Gabriel can add and the number of songs Luri can add is 80 - 40 = 40.

"To determine the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to calculate the number of oranges he ate and then multiply it by the amount he gave up per orange.

First, we need to find 2/5 of 60, which is the fraction of oranges Stetson ate. This can be calculated as follows:

(2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Now, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange, which is $10.

24 * $10 = $240

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240.

"To determine the total hours James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he runs in a week and then divide that by his speed.

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. To find the total miles run in a week, we multiply the miles run per day by the number of days:

miles run in a week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
= 12 * 5
= 60 miles/week

Now, we divide the total miles run in a week by James' speed to find the total hours he runs in a week:

hours run in a week = total miles run in a week / speed
= 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
= 60/10

"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we must first calculate the total amount of oats consumed by his horses in a day. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, so each horse's daily consumption is 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total daily consumption is 10 pounds/horse * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

To find the total consumption for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to determine how many 50-pound bags of oats are required to meet this total consumption. To do this, we divide the total consumption by the weight of each bag: 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

To calculate this, we can multiply the numerator (2) by 27 and then divide by the denominator (3):

Pomeranians = (2 × 27) / 3
Pomeranians = 54 / 3
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can express this as a fraction:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) × 18

To calculate this, we can multiply the numerator (1) by 18 and then divide by the denominator (3):

Girl Pomeranians = (1 × 18) / 3
Girl Pomeranians = 18 / 3
Girl Pomeranians = 6

"To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we need to calculate the arithmetic mean of the given temperatures. 

The formula for the arithmetic mean is: (sum of values) / (number of values)

Given temperatures are -48°F for Southlandia, 21°F for Northlandia, and -3°F for Midlandia.

First, we add the temperatures: -48 + 21 - 3 = -30

Then, we divide the sum by the number of values, which is 3: -30 / 3 = -10

Therefore, the average highest temperature of the three countries is -10°F."
"To determine the number of days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the remaining amount first.

The total cost of the toy car is $12, and the child already has $4 in savings. Therefore, the remaining amount is:

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find out how many days it will take to save the remaining amount.

Daily savings = $2
Days to save the remaining amount = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Days to save the remaining amount = $8 / $2
Days to save the remaining amount = 4

"When applying discounts, it's essential to consider the terms of the sale and any additional promotions. In this case, Heather is purchasing 2 packs of razors, but the buy one get one free offer means she only pays for 1 pack. The original price of 1 pack is $4.00.

To calculate the cost of each individual razor, we need to first determine the total cost of the 2 packs with the sale and the coupon. The coupon provides a $2.00 discount, so the total cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors. To find the cost of each individual razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors: $\frac{\$2.00}{8} = \$0.25$.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 \times 100 = 25$ cents.

Therefore, the cost of each individual razor after the discount is 25 cents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

"To determine the number of Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have and then divide that by the number of oranges required for one pie.

Let's start by calculating the number of oranges Ashley brought. Since she has 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, we can express this as 5 × 10 = 50 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought. It's given that she brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so we can express this as 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

To find the total number of oranges they have, we add the number of oranges Ashley and Brianne brought: 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie requires 3 oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges required for one pie: 120 ÷ 3 = 40 pies.

Therefore, the number of Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make is 40.

"To determine the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. The cost of the first venue is a flat fee of $200 plus an additional $5 per guest for food, which can be expressed as 200 + 5x. The cost of the second venue is a per-person charge of $25, which can be expressed as 25x.

To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides of the equation yields:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides of the equation by 20 gives us:

x = 200/20

x = 10

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7.

The total number of insects collected by the three is given as 43. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: B + B = 2B, and 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the equation becomes:

2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x.

The cost of the grape gum is $2, and the cost of the green apple gum is half of that, which is $1. The total cost of all the gum is the sum of the costs of the strawberry gum, the grape gum, and the green apple gum. This can be represented as 2x + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2x.

We are given that the total cost is $7. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x = 7.

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, 2x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2, x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"To optimize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine the most cost-effective option between the 2 x 4 and 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

Let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4 piece of wood, the cost per stick is $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick.
For a 2 x 8 piece of wood, the cost per stick is $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick.

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood offers the lowest cost per stick, we will focus on this option.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24 budget: 24 / 6 = 4.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces of wood will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

Therefore, the most cost-effective option for Frederick is to buy 2 x 8 pieces of wood, and he can make a total of 1600 popsicle sticks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1600}$"
"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's sled dogs, we need to calculate the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has four legs and Mario has six dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00, so the total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

"To determine the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo, we need to calculate the number of animals at each location and then sum them.

Let's start by identifying the number of cows at the zoo. Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, and the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

Next, we need to find the number of sheep at the farm. We know the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Given that the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

To find the total number of animals, we add the number of animals at the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's analyze the problem. We are given that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. If Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'.

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can write the equation as:
x + y = 4(x + y)

However, this equation is not necessary to solve the problem. We can directly use the information that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, so we can write the equation as:
12 = 4x
4 = 4y

Simplifying the equations:
x = 3
y = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit required for Andy to reach his weight loss goal, we first need to calculate the total number of days he has to achieve this goal. 

Since Andy's birthday is on July 19th and today is December 31st, we can calculate the number of days as follows:

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day.
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days.
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days.
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days.
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days.
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days.
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Now, we need to calculate the total calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Since it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, we multiply this by 30:

Total calories needed = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calories needed / Total days
= 105,000 calories / 171 days
≈ 613.5 calories/day

Therefore, Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of approximately 613.5 calories to reach his weight loss goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{614}$"
"To determine Gerald's remaining funds, we must first calculate his weekly earnings and then subtract the amount he spent.

Weekly earnings can be calculated by multiplying his daily earnings by the number of days worked in a week. Since Gerald earns $30 per day and works 7 days a week, his weekly earnings are:

$30/day × 7 days = $210

Now, to find out how much Gerald has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his weekly earnings:

$210 - $100 = $110

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left."
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total distance she will run. Given that each lap is 0.25 km and she is required to run 8 laps, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

Total distance = Number of laps × Distance per lap
Total distance = 8 laps × 0.25 km/lap
Total distance = 2 km

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink by multiplying the total distance by the amount of water she needs to drink per kilometer:

Total water = Total distance × Water per kilometer
Total water = 2 km × 60 ml/km
Total water = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 120 milliliters of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the amount of money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's find 20% of $500, which is the amount spent on clothes:
\[ 20\% \times 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

Now, subtract this amount from the initial $500 to find the remaining money after buying clothes:
\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, we need to find 25% of the remaining $400, which is the amount spent on CDs:
\[ 25\% \times 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

Now, subtract this amount from the remaining money after buying clothes to find the final amount:
\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"Given that the total cost of a house and a lot is $120,000, and the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can express this relationship as an equation.

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combining like terms, we get 4x = 120,000.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000.

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can substitute the value of x into the expression: 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To calculate the profit earned by Tara on her canvas bags, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Tara purchased 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. The total number of bags is the product of the number of packs and the number of bags per pack, which is 8 * 5 = 40 bags. The total cost is then the product of the total number of bags and the cost per bag, which is 40 * $4 = $160.

Next, we calculate the total revenue. Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue is the product of the total number of bags and the selling price per bag, which is 40 * $8 = $320.

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: profit = $320 - $160 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To determine the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time of the fight in minutes and multiply it by the average number of punches he throws per minute.

The fight consists of 5 rounds, each lasting 3 minutes. Therefore, the total duration of the fight is 5 rounds * 3 minutes/round = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is given by the product of the total time and the rate of punches per minute: 15 minutes * 25 punches/minute = 375 punches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{375}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. We know that Suzanne made 36 cookies. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, we can calculate Josh's total as follows:

Josh's cookies = (1/4) × Suzanne's cookies
= (1/4) × 36
= 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. We can calculate Kelsie's total as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 × Josh's cookies
= 2 × 9
= 18

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

The final answer is: 18"
"To calculate the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has:
   Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   Total money from $10 bills = 4 \* $10 = $40
   Total money from $20 bills = 6 \* $20 = $120
   Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money:
   Half of the total money = \frac{1}{2} \* $160 = $80
   Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

3. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner:
   3/5 of the remaining money = \frac{3}{5} \* $80 = $48
   Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"Let's analyze the problem. We are given that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob to shingle a house. If Rob takes 2 hours, we need to convert this time to minutes to establish a common unit of measurement. 

Rob's time in minutes = 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Now, we can express Royce's time in terms of Rob's time using the given relationship: Royce's time = 2 * Rob's time + 40 minutes.

Substituting Rob's time (120 minutes) into the equation, we get: Royce's time = 2 * 120 + 40 = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

Therefore, the time it takes Royce to shingle a house is 280 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool needed, we must calculate the total for each item and then sum the results.

Let's start by identifying the number of skeins required for each item:

- Hats: 3 children * 2 skeins per hat = 3 × 2 = 6 skeins
- Scarves: 3 children * 4 skeins per scarf = 3 × 4 = 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 3 children * 12 skeins per sweater = 3 × 12 = 36 skeins
- Mittens: 3 children * 1 skein per pair = 3 × 1 = 3 skeins
- Socks: 3 children * 2 skeins per pair = 3 × 2 = 6 skeins

Now, let's add the total number of skeins needed for each item:

The final answer is: 63"
"To determine the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of problems Chris completed on Tuesday. Since he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, we can express this as 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

Now, we need to find the total number of problems completed by Tuesday. This is the sum of the problems completed on Monday and Tuesday, which is 12 + 36 = 48.

The total number of problems Chris has to complete is 100. Therefore, the number of problems remaining after Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52.

Next, we need to calculate the number of problems Chris completed on Wednesday. He completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61.

To find the number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we subtract the total number of problems completed by Wednesday from the total number of problems: 100 - 61 = 39.

The final answer is: $\boxed{39}$"
"To determine the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then sum them.

Tony's rate is given as 6 quarts per hour. 

Bobby's rate is one less than Tony's, so we can express it as 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy's rate is twice Bobby's, which can be represented as 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky's rate is two fewer quarts than Kathy's, so it is 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, we can find the total rate by adding the individual rates together: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts per hour.

The final answer is: 29"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread left, we need to apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total number of loaves sold: 93 (morning sales) + 39 (afternoon sales) = 132 loaves.

Next, we subtract the total number of loaves sold and the number of loaves returned from the initial number of loaves baked: 200 (initial loaves) - 132 (total sold) - 6 (returned) = 62 loaves.

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread left is 62."
"To determine the number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant, we need to calculate the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips separately.

For the red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row:

36 (red tulips) ÷ 6 (tulips per row) = 6

For the blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row:

24 (blue tulips) ÷ 8 (tulips per row) = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips. The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of cookies.

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be used for the granola and snack mix. Since Heather divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of them will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Now, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies. The total number of cups of raisins is 27, and 9 cups will be used for the granola and snack mix. So, 27 - 9 = 18 cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide the number of cups of raisins left for the oatmeal cookies by 3/4 to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make.

To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. So, 18 ÷ (3/4) = 18 × (4/3) = 18 × 4 / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then multiply it by the cost per kilowatt hour.

First, let's calculate the daily and weekly consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh). Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) per hour, the daily consumption is already given in kWh. 

Daily consumption before adding the device: 12 kWh
Weekly consumption before adding the device: 12 kWh/hour * 7 hours = 84 kWh

Daily consumption after adding the device: 12 kWh + 2 kWh = 14 kWh
Weekly consumption after adding the device: 14 kWh/hour * 7 hours = 98 kWh

Now, we can calculate the cost of the electricity before and after adding the device. Given that the cost per kilowatt hour is $1.50, we can multiply the weekly consumption by the cost per kWh.

Cost before adding the device: 84 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $126
Cost after adding the device: 98 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $147

The difference in weekly electric bill: $147 - $126 = $21

The final answer is: $21"
"When it comes to proportional reasoning, we're dealing with ratios and proportions. In this case, we're given that one person can paint half a house in 5 days. To find out how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we need to establish a proportion.

Let's denote the number of hours it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house as x. Since 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day, we can set up the following proportion:

1 person * 5 days = 5 people * x days

We know that 1 person can paint half a house in 5 days, so we can also express this as:

1 person * 5 days = 0.5 house

Now, we can set up the proportion:

1 person * 5 days = 5 people * x days
1 person * 5 days = 0.5 house

To find x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = (0.5 house) / 5 people
x = 0.1 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can convert 0.1 days to hours:

x = 0.1 days * 24 hours/day
x = 2.4 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people approximately 2.4 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.4}$"
"Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as C and the number of sofas as S. We are given that S = 20 and C = S + 2. We can express this relationship as an equation:

S = 20
C = S + 2
C = 20 + 2
C = 22

We are also given that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so we can express this relationship as an equation:

Jenna's C = 3C
Jenna's S = Jenna's C - 2
Jenna's S = 3C - 2
Jenna's S = 3(22) - 2
Jenna's S = 66 - 2
Jenna's S = 64

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
Ophelia has S = 20 sofas and C = 22 chairs, so she has a total of S + C = 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has Jenna's S = 64 sofas and Jenna's C = 66 chairs, so she has a total of Jenna's S + Jenna's C = 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs is 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: $\boxed{172}$"
"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic expressions.

Let's denote the number of CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set as x. We know that the cost of one CD is $4. Therefore, the total amount of money Tom spent on CDs is 4x.

We also know that Tom spent a total of $48 on the CD and the headphone set. Since the cost of the CD is $4, the amount of money Tom spent on the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

4x + 44 = 48

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 44 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 48 - 44
4x = 4

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 4/4
x = 1

However, this represents the number of CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. To find the number of CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set and the CD, we can simply add 1 to x:

Number of CDs that could have been bought = x + 1
Number of CDs that could have been bought = 1 + 1
Number of CDs that could have been bought = 2

Now, let's find the number of CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. This is simply the number of CDs that could have been bought minus 1:

Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = Number of CDs that could have been bought - 1
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = 2 - 1
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = 1

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the different scenarios where his workout time varied.

Let's denote the number of weeks where Josh spent 4 hours as 'x'. Since he spent 5 hours for two consecutive weeks, we can represent this as 2 weeks. Lastly, there is 1 week where he spent 6 hours.

The total number of weeks is 8. We can set up an equation to represent the total number of weeks: x + 2 + 1 = 8.

Solving for x, we get x = 8 - 3 = 5.

Now, we can calculate the total hours for each scenario:
- For the weeks where he spent 4 hours, there are 5 weeks. So, 5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours.
- For the weeks where he spent 5 hours, there are 2 weeks. So, 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours.
- For the week where he spent 6 hours, there is 1 week. So, 1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours.

Now, we add up the total hours: 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To determine the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 × 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Now, we need to determine the number of passengers who get on at the second stop. It is stated that 3 times fewer passengers get on than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, we need to find 3 times 21, which is 3 × 21 = 63. However, since we are looking for the number of passengers who get on, we need to subtract 63 from the number of passengers who got off, which is 21. So, 21 - 63 = -42. Since you can't have a negative number of passengers, this means that 63 more passengers got on.

So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is:
59 (left) + 63 (got in) = 122

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"Let's denote Jame's current age as $J$ and his cousin's current age as $C$. We are given that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so we can express his current age as $J = 27 - 5 = 22$. 

In 8 years, Jame's age will be $J + 8 = 22 + 8 = 30$, and his cousin's age will be $C + 8$. According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. This can be expressed as the equation:

$$C + 8 = 2(30) - 5$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$C + 8 = 60 - 5$$
$$C + 8 = 55$$

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:

$$C = 55 - 8$$
$$C = 47$$

Now, we need to find the difference between Jame's current age and his cousin's current age:

$$\text{Difference} = J - C$$
$$\text{Difference} = 22 - 47$$
$$\text{Difference} = -25$$

Since age cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of the difference:

$$\text{Difference} = | -25 |$$
$$\text{Difference} = 25$$

The final numerical answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Let's analyze the given information and solve for the cost of one monitor.

Given:
1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The cost of the computer is $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

We can represent the cost of the printer as $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's denote the cost of one monitor as x. Since there are 2 monitors, the total cost of the monitors is 2x.

We can set up an equation to represent the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer:

Cost of computer + Cost of 2 monitors + Cost of printer = Total cost
$1,100 + 2x + $700 = $2,400

Combine like terms and simplify the equation:

$1,800 + 2x = $2,400

Subtract $1,800 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable:

2x = $2,400 - $1,800
2x = $600

Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

x = $600 / 2
x = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. 

First, we know that the boys brought 60 seashells each, and there are 10 boys. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

Next, we are told that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be expressed as 60 + 4 * 60. 

To find the total number of seashells brought by the girls, we need to calculate 4 * 60 first, which is 240. Then, we add 60 to this result, giving us 300. 

So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is 600 + 300 = 900.

Since there are 10 girls, we can find the number of seashells brought by each girl by dividing the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls: 900 / 10 = 90.

Therefore, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 90.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic reasoning.

Let G represent the initial number of candies George had. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can express the number of candies Nick had as 2G.

We are given that George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies George has left is G - 5. We are also given that George has 3 candies left, which can be expressed as G - 5 = 3.

To find the value of G, we can solve the equation G - 5 = 3 by adding 5 to both sides, resulting in G = 8.

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick had by substituting G = 8 into the expression 2G, which gives us 2(8) = 16.

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine Anne's age, we need to calculate Alyana's age first, as she is 4 years younger than Chenny. Given that Chenny is 10 years old, we can express Alyana's age as:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we can calculate Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

"To determine the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick. 

The second book is 50 mm thick.

The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so its thickness can be expressed as 50 - 5 = 45 mm.

The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness can be calculated as 2 * 31 = 62 mm.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:

31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To determine the number of vlogs Emma should make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of vlogs she aims to make and the number of vlogs she has already created.

Let's denote the total number of vlogs Emma aims to make as T = 72, and the number of vlogs she has already made as M. We know that M = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54.

Now, we can calculate the number of vlogs Emma should make to complete her goal by subtracting M from T:

T - M = 72 - 54
T - M = 18

Therefore, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

"To determine the total amount you paid, we need to calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. This can be done by multiplying the bill by the decimal equivalent of 20%, which is 0.20.

$50 × 0.20 = $10

Now, we add the calculated tip to the original bill to find the total amount you paid.

$50 + $10 = $60

Therefore, the total amount you paid is $60."
"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step, applying basic arithmetic operations and logical reasoning.

Let's denote the eldest boy's initial share as $x. Since the total amount is shared among 3 boys, we can express the initial share as $18 / 3 = $6. Therefore, x = $6.

Now, let's calculate the eldest boy's subsequent actions:

1. He added $5 to his share: x + $5 = $6 + $5 = $11.
2. He added another $10: $11 + $10 = $21.
3. He spent $8: $21 - $8 = $13.
4. He tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8: $13 * 3 = $39.

Therefore, the eldest boy now has $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Given that Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125 and wants to save twice as much in the second half of April as in the first half, we can denote the number of days in the first half of April as x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be 30 - x.

Let's denote the amount saved in the first half as y. Then, the amount saved in the second half will be 2y.

The total amount saved in the first half is xy, and the total amount saved in the second half is 2xy. The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is xy + 2xy = 3xy.

We can set up the equation: 3xy = 1125.

Since x is the number of days in the first half, and the total number of days in April is 30, we can write x + (30 - x) = 30, which simplifies to 30 = 30, and this equation is true for any value of x. However, we know that x must be a positive integer less than or equal to 15, since the first half of April cannot have more than 15 days.

We can substitute x = 15 into the equation 3xy = 1125 to find y: 3(15)y = 1125, which simplifies to 45y = 1125.

To find y, we divide both sides by 45: y = 1125 / 45 = 25.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the amount saved in the second half is 2y = 2(25) = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she purchased and subtract that from the $20 she gave.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 × $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 × $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 × $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $20: $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny, we need to calculate their individual totals and then find the difference.

Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, and he completed 20 tasks. We can calculate his total earnings using the formula for the area of a rectangle, where the base is the number of tasks (20) and the height is the amount earned per task ($0.8).

Jairus' total = base × height = 20 × $0.8 = $16

Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, and she also completed 20 tasks. We can calculate her total earnings using the same formula.

Jenny's total = base × height = 20 × $0.5 = $10

Now, we can find the difference between Jairus' total and Jenny's total by subtracting Jenny's total from Jairus' total.

Difference = Jairus' total - Jenny's total = $16 - $10 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"Given that Jeff and Brad are dividing 100 dollars between them, with Jeff receiving 4 times as much as Brad, we can model this situation using a linear equation. Let's denote the amount Brad receives as x. Since Jeff receives 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's share can be represented as 4x.

The total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so the sum of their shares is 100. This can be expressed as the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 100

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 100 / 5
x = 20

Now that we know Brad receives 20 dollars, we can find Jeff's share by multiplying Brad's share by 4:

Jeff's share = 4x
= 4(20)
= 80

Therefore, Jeff receives 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

The distance to work is 3 miles, and since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Since he works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is 6 * 5 = 30 miles.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we can break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which consists of 26 letters each time. This gives us a total of 2 * 26 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

Now, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is the sum of the letters from the first two steps: 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. To find the total number of letters, we add this to the previous total: 65 + 65 = 130.

The total number of letters Elise has written is 130.

The final answer is: $\boxed{130}$"
"This problem illustrates a classic example of a geometric progression, where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed constant. In this case, the first term (a) is 3, and the common ratio (r) is also 3.

The number of families notified in each round can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of a geometric progression: a_n = a * r^(n-1).

To find the number of families notified in the fourth round, we substitute a = 3, r = 3, and n = 4 into the formula:

a_4 = 3 * 3^(4-1)
     = 3 * 3^3
     = 3 * 27
     = 81

Therefore, the number of families notified in the fourth round is 81.

The final answer is: 81"
"To determine Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and add it to his final weight. 

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is calculated as follows:

Total weight lost = 10 pounds/month * 3 months
Total weight lost = 10 * 3
Total weight lost = 30 pounds

Now, we add the total weight lost to his final weight to find his initial weight:

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 70 + 30
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to establish the total number of toys in the larger play set. Given that James's play set has 80 toys and the larger play set is five times larger, we can express this relationship as a multiplication equation:

Let's denote the number of toys in the larger play set as L. We can write the equation as:

L = 5 * 80

Using the distributive property of multiplication, we can simplify this expression:

L = 5 * 80
L = (5 * 80)
L = 400

Now, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as x. We can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The final answer is: 398"
"To determine the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

- 5 notebooks at $1.50 each: 5 × $1.50 = $7.50
- 2 pens at $0.25 each: 2 × $0.25 = $0.50
- 1 calculator at $12 each: 1 × $12 = $12
- 1 geometry set at $10 each: 1 × $10 = $10

The total cost without the discount is the sum of these individual costs: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Now, let's apply the 10% discount to the total cost. To do this, we multiply the total cost by 0.10 (which is equivalent to 10%): $30 × 0.10 = $3.

The discount amount is $3, so we subtract this from the total cost to get the final amount Daniel has to spend: $30 - $3 = $27.

The final answer is: $27"
"To calculate the total cost of the items, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations. First, we multiply the quantity of each item by its price.

The cost of 5 hamburgers at $4 each is calculated as follows: 5 × 4 = $20.

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 packs of potato fries at $0.30 each: 10 × 0.30 = $3.

Lastly, we determine the cost of 5 cans of fruit drinks at $2 each: 5 × 2 = $10.

Now, we add the costs of the items together to find the total cost: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill: $50 - $33 = $17.

Therefore, the change Carly receives is $17."
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to apply the commission structure. The commission rate is tiered, with a base rate of 30% for the first $1000 in sales and an additional 10% for sales above $1000.

First, we calculate the commission for the initial $1000: 30% of $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

Next, we determine the amount of sales above $1000: $2500 - $1000 = $1500.

Then, we calculate the additional commission for the sales above $1000: 10% of $1500 = 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

Finally, we add the commission for the initial $1000 and the additional commission for the sales above $1000 to find the total commission: $300 + $150 = $450.

The total amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of bottles required for his party. 

Bill has 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. Therefore, he has a total of 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

For his 70 guests, he wants to provide 2 bottles each, resulting in a total of 70 x 2 = 140 bottles needed for the guests.

To find the total number of bottles required, we add the number of bottles he already has to the number of bottles needed for the guests: 140 (for guests) + 48 (he already has) = 188 bottles.

Since Bill already has 48 bottles, he needs to purchase 188 - 48 = 140 additional bottles.

The final answer is: 140"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. We know that in warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water.

Let's denote the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in cold water as C. Therefore, the time it takes him to swim a mile in warm water is 2C + 2.

We are given that in cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

C = 16

Now, we can find the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water:

Time in warm water = 2C + 2
= 2(16) + 2
= 32 + 2
= 34 minutes

Next, we need to find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water. 

Time to swim 3 miles in cold water = 3C
= 3(16)
= 48 minutes

Time to swim 3 miles in warm water = 3(2C + 2)
= 3(2(16) + 2)
= 3(32 + 2)
= 3(34)
= 102 minutes

Now, we can find the difference in time between the two days:

Difference in time = Time to swim 3 miles in warm water - Time to swim 3 miles in cold water
= 102 - 48
= 54 minutes

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the target savings by his weekly earnings.

First, let's calculate John's daily earnings:
2 dollars/hour * 5 hours/day = $10/day

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, we can divide the target savings by his weekly earnings to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80:
$80 ÷ $40/week = 2 weeks

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total cost of lunch at Subway, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. Since it costs thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub, we can express this relationship as a multiplication factor of 3.

Let's denote the cost of the foot-long fish sub as F. The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub can be expressed as 3F.

Given that the cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40, we can substitute this value into the expression for the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:

Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3F
= 3 * $40
= $120

Now, we can calculate the total cost for both subs by adding their individual costs:

Total cost = Cost of the foot-long fish sub + Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub
= $40 + $120
= $160

The final answer is: $160"
"To determine the total number of holes in the bag of buttons, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes.

Let's denote the number of buttons with 2 holes as B2 and the number of buttons with 4 holes as B4. We are given that B2 = 7.

The total number of buttons in the bag is 21, so the number of buttons with 4 holes is B4 = 21 - B2 = 21 - 7 = 14.

Now, we can calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes: 2 * B2 = 2 * 7 = 14.

Next, we calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes: 4 * B4 = 4 * 14 = 56.

The total number of holes in all the buttons is the sum of the holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes: 14 + 56 = 70.

"To determine the size of Peter's locker, we need to establish the relationship between the lockers' sizes. Given that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we can express Zack's locker size as half of Timothy's locker, which is $\frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12$ cubic inches.

Now, to find Peter's locker size, we need to calculate one-fourth of Zack's locker size. This can be expressed as $\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = \frac{12}{4} = 3$ cubic inches.

Therefore, the size of Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the difference between Juan's current coffee intake and the recommended daily intake.

Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as x. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, her coffee intake is x/2. Given that Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks, his current coffee intake is 10 * (x/2) = 5x.

We are given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. Therefore, x = 4.

Now, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake:
Juan drinks 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups of coffee.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of hamsters: 3 cages * 10 hamsters per cage = 3 × 10 = 30 hamsters.

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs: 3 cages * 5 guinea pigs per cage = 3 × 5 = 15 guinea pigs.

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents: 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 30 + 15 = 45 rodents.

The final answer is: 45"
"To calculate the average weight of the three friends, we need to determine their individual weights and then find the sum of their weights divided by 3.

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so we can express her weight as 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Bob's weight is twice that of Susan's, which can be calculated as 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the total weight of the three friends by adding their individual weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by 3: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"Given the initial angle of the pyramid, θ1 = 32°, and the rate at which the sun moves, dθ/dt = 5°/hour, we can calculate the final angle, θ2, after 10 hours.

We know that the change in angle, Δθ, is given by the product of the rate of change and the time interval, Δt. In this case, Δt = 10 hours.

Δθ = dθ/dt * Δt
= 5°/hour * 10 hours
= 50°

To find the final angle, θ2, we add the initial angle, θ1, to the change in angle, Δθ.

θ2 = θ1 + Δθ
= 32° + 50°
= 82°

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 82°.

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine the total number of candles James needs, we must first calculate the combined age of his two sons. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, so the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

The total number of candles required is the sum of their ages: 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we can calculate the number of packs needed by dividing the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

To find the total cost, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

To convert the time from minutes to pages, we need to know Judy's reading rate. We are given that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she can read per minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes, which is 2 / 1.5 = 4/3 pages per minute.

Now, we can multiply the number of minutes Judy read in the first week by her reading rate to find the total number of pages she read in the first week: 105 minutes * (4/3 pages/minute) = 105 * 4/3 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, in two weeks, Judy read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's age today as x.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. 
In 7 years, his nephew's age will be x + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. 
So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 
First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: 

$$\frac{51}{3} = x + 7$$

This simplifies to:

$$17 = x + 7$$

Next, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

$$17 - 7 = x$$

This simplifies to:

$$x = 10$$

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. Then, for each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00, resulting in a total of 3 * $1.00 = $3.00. 

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, the total for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Given the scenario, we can represent the number of goals scored by each teenager as variables. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, the number of goals scored by Anna as A, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

We are given the following information:

1. R = M + 20
2. R = A + 45
3. R = 80

From equations (1) and (2), we can equate the expressions for R to get:
M + 20 = A + 45

Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us:
M = A + 25

Now, we can substitute the expression for M into equation (1):
R = (A + 25) + 20
R = A + 45

Since we know that R = 80, we can substitute this value into the equation:
80 = A + 45

Subtracting 45 from both sides gives us:
A = 35

Now that we have the value of A, we can find the value of M:
M = A + 25
M = 35 + 25
M = 60

Now that we have the values of A and M, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Liam and Mitchell, we need to calculate the total amount each made from selling lemonades.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece. To find the total amount he made, we multiply the number of lemonades sold by the price per lemonade: 21 × 4 = $84.

Now, we subtract the amount Liam made ($63) from the amount Mitchell made ($84) to find the difference: 84 - 63 = 21.

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam selling lemonade that weekend.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and add them up.

First, let's calculate the number of wooden action figures Peter bought from Sunday through Wednesday. He spent $5 each day on wooden action figures for 4 days, so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is 4 × $5 = $20. Since he spent $20, he bought 20 ÷ 5 = 4 wooden action figures.

Next, we need to calculate the number of plastic action figures Peter can buy from Thursday through Saturday. He has $70 - $20 = $50 left. He has 5 days left, so the total number of plastic action figures he can buy is 50 ÷ 2 = 25.

In total, Peter bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 4 + 25 = 29.

The total cost of the kitten is $308."
"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the shops per week and per month, and then compare it to the total number of roses Ford grows per month.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered per week:
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is:
65 roses/week × 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per month:
40 roses/week × 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the remaining balance in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount withdrawn and subtract it from the initial balance.

The initial balance in the account is $3000. The monthly withdrawal is $100. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months in 2 years is 2 x 12 = 24.

The total amount withdrawn in 24 months can be calculated as follows:

Total amount withdrawn = Monthly withdrawal x Number of months
= $100 x 24
= $2400

Now, we subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial balance to find the remaining balance:

Remaining balance = Initial balance - Total amount withdrawn
= $3000 - $2400
= $600

Therefore, the remaining balance in Katina's savings account after 2 years is $600."
"To determine the net profit of the food truck, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf yields 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30 per sandwich.

The cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches. To find the cost per sandwich, we divide the total cost by the number of sandwiches: $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00 per sandwich.

The total cost per sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and cheese and condiments: $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30 per sandwich.

The total revenue is the selling price per sandwich multiplied by the number of sandwiches sold: 10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $70.00 (total revenue) - $33.00 (total cost) = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To determine the total amount of money Kate can make from selling her muffin crayons, we need to calculate the total number of muffin crayons she can produce and then multiply that by the price of each muffin crayon.

First, we calculate the total number of crayons Kate has: 3 boxes * 64 crayons per box = 192 crayons.

Next, we determine the number of muffin crayons she can make by dividing the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per muffin: 192 crayons / 8 crayons per muffin = 24 muffins.

Now, we multiply the number of muffins by the price per muffin to find the total amount of money Kate can make: 24 muffins * $1.50 per muffin = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To calculate the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to consider the area of the bedroom, the cost of the materials, and the cost of labor.

First, we calculate the area of the bedroom. Given that the bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet, we can find the area by multiplying the length and width:

Area = length × width
= 18 ft × 12 ft
= 216 sq ft

Next, we calculate the cost of the materials. The new carpet costs $12 per square foot, and the padding costs $2 per square foot. We multiply the area by the respective costs:

Cost of carpet = 216 sq ft × $12/sq ft = $2592
Cost of padding = 216 sq ft × $2/sq ft = $432

The total cost of the materials is the sum of the cost of the carpet and the cost of the padding:

Total cost of materials = $2592 + $432 = $3024

Now, we calculate the cost of labor. The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet. We multiply the area by the respective costs:

Cost to remove old carpet = 216 sq ft × $4/sq ft = $864
Cost to install new carpet = 216 sq ft × $34/sq ft = $7344

The total cost of labor is the sum of the cost to remove the old carpet and the cost to install the new carpet:

Total cost of labor = $864 + $7344 = $8208

Finally, we calculate the total cost to replace the carpet by adding the total cost of materials and the total cost of labor:

Total cost = Total cost of materials + Total cost of labor
= $3024 + $8208
= $11232

The final answer is: $11232"
"To calculate the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to compute the arithmetic mean of the total number of birds observed over the week.

The total number of birds seen is the sum of the birds observed on each day: 50 (days 1-2) + 0 (day 3) + 120 (days 4-5) + 20 (day 6) + 90 (day 7).

Total birds seen = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90
Total birds seen = 280

The number of days is 7.

Average birds per day = Total birds seen / Number of days
Average birds per day = 280 / 7
Average birds per day = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"Given the problem, we can represent the operations performed on the number train as an algebraic expression. Let's denote the starting value of the number train as $x$. The problem states that the starting value plus half the number was divided by 5 and the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12.

We can express this as:

$$\frac{(x + \frac{x}{2})}{5} \cdot (x - 12)$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$\frac{\frac{3x}{2}}{5} \cdot (x - 12)$$

$$\frac{3x}{10} \cdot (x - 12)$$

$$\frac{3x^2 - 36x}{10}$$

Now, we are given that the starting value of the number train is 20. We can substitute $x = 20$ into the expression to find the final value of the number train:

$$\frac{3(20)^2 - 36(20)}{10}$$

$$\frac{3(400) - 720}{10}$$

$$\frac{1200 - 720}{10}$$

$$\frac{480}{10}$$

$$48$$

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To determine the total number of cards the boy and his brother have together, we need to calculate the number of cards each of them possesses and then sum them.

Let's denote the number of cards the boy has as B. We know that his brother has 3 fewer cards than he does, so the number of cards his brother has can be expressed as B - 3.

Given that the boy has 5 cards, we can substitute B = 5 into the expression for his brother's cards: B - 3 = 5 - 3 = 2.

Now, to find the total number of cards they have together, we add the number of cards the boy and his brother have: B + (B - 3) = 5 + 2 = 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"When dealing with temperature discrepancies in ovens, it's essential to understand the concept of proportional relationships. In this case, we have a 4% deviation from the set temperature of 450 degrees, resulting in an actual temperature of 468 degrees.

To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to for a recipe calling for 520 degrees, we can use the same proportional relationship. The difference between the set and actual temperatures is 18 degrees, which is 4% of 450. We can set up a proportion to find the temperature she should set the oven to:

Let x be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. We know that 4% of 450 is 18, so we can set up the proportion:

(4/100) * 450 = 18
(4/100) * x = y

We want to find x, the temperature she should set the oven to for a recipe calling for 520 degrees. We can set up another proportion using the same percentage deviation:

(4/100) * 520 = y

Since the percentage deviation is the same, we can equate the two expressions for y:

(4/100) * 450 = (4/100) * 520

Now, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides by 100/4:

x = (100/4) * (4/100) * 520
x = (100/4) * 520
x = 25 * 520

"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. We can convert 1 hour to minutes by multiplying 60 minutes by 1, which equals 60 minutes. Adding 30 minutes to that gives us 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for the first movie.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert 2 hours to minutes by multiplying 60 minutes by 2, which equals 120 minutes. Adding 5 minutes to that gives us 120 + 5 = 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we add the time for both movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To determine the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price.

Herb's house price = $76,000
30% of Herb's house price = 0.30 × $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
= $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses.
Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
= $76,000 + $53,200
= $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend to the charity event.

Let's start by determining the number of cups and dishes Judy brought. Since Judy bought a dozen cups, which is equivalent to 12 cups, and twice as many dishes as cups, she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes Judy brought: 12 (cups) + 24 (dishes) = 36.

Next, we need to determine the number of cups and dishes her friend brought. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes her friend brought: 40 (cups) + 44 (dishes) = 84.

To find the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend, we add the total number of cups and dishes each brought: 36 (Judy's total) + 84 (friend's total) = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost per pair of contacts, we need to calculate the total cost of the contacts and divide it by the total number of pairs.

First, let's find the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will have:
90 contacts/box * 2 boxes = 180 contacts
Since each box lasts 45 days, the total number of days the contacts will last is:
180 contacts / 2 contacts/day = 90 days

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the contacts:
2 boxes * $100/box = $200
Since there's a 10% discount, we need to subtract 10% of $200 from the total cost:
10% of $200 = 0.10 * $200 = $20
$200 - $20 = $180

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts:
$180 / 180 pairs = $1 per pair

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings based on their respective work hours and hourly wage.

Jill worked a total of 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, which sums up to 2 + 1 = 3 hours. Given her hourly wage of $10, her total earnings can be calculated as 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which translates to 2 * 2 = 4 hours. On Sunday, he worked three times as long as Jill, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Therefore, John's total work hours amount to 4 + 3 = 7 hours. With an hourly wage of $10, his total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total calories burned during her activities. 

The rate of calories burned during aerobics is 500 calories per hour, and she spends 2 hours doing aerobics. Therefore, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

The rate of calories burned during running is 600 calories per hour, and she spends 1 hour running. Therefore, the total calories burned from running is 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running: 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can find the number of 200-calorie units by dividing the total calories burned by 200: 1600 calories / 200 calories = 8.

To find the total amount of water needed, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by the amount of water required per unit: 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml.

The final answer is: $\boxed{800}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of red, blue, and green jelly beans. Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:

R = 0.99B

Additionally, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we have:

G = 1.01B

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3.01:

B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find R and G:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485

G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To find the average of Jared's typing speed measurements, we need to calculate the arithmetic mean of the three values. 

First, let's list the measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM.

To find the average, we add up all the measurements and divide by the number of measurements. The sum of the measurements is 47 + 52 + 57 = 156. Since there are three measurements, we divide the sum by 3.

The average is calculated as follows: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To determine the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the net change in weight over a period of 5 weeks.

Let's denote the weight lost per week as L and the weight gained per week as G. We are given that L = -1.25 pounds and G = 1.75 pounds.

The net change in weight per week is the difference between the weight gained and the weight lost: G - L = 1.75 - (-1.25) = 1.75 + 1.25 = 3 pounds.

To find the net change in weight over 5 weeks, we multiply the net change per week by the number of weeks: 3 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 15 pounds.

Therefore, the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 15 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we need to break down the information given.

First, let's consider the people invited via email. Alex invites 100 people, and each of them invites 2 friends. This can be represented as an arithmetic series: 100 + 2(100) = 300.

Next, we need to account for the people invited by Alex's friends. She calls 10 friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses. This can be represented as 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we need to find the total number of people attending. This is the sum of the people invited via email and the people invited by Alex's friends: 300 + 18 = 318.

However, this count includes Alex herself, so we need to add 1 to the total to account for her. Therefore, the total number of people attending is 318 + 1 = 319.

The final answer is: 319"
"To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we need to calculate the weight of the Papillon first, then multiply it by 44.

Let's start with the Affenpinscher, which weighs 10 pounds. The Dachshund, being twice as heavy as the Affenpinscher, weighs 2 × 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon, on the other hand, weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so its weight is 20 ÷ 4 = 5 pounds.

Now, to find the weight of the Mastiff, we multiply the weight of the Papillon by 44: 44 × 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To determine the cost difference between purchasing the boots on Amazon and eBay, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform.

The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16, and the shipping cost is $4. Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and the shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8. Thus, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference in cost, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"The beanstalk's exponential growth can be modeled using the formula:

h(t) = h0 \* 2^t

where h(t) is the height of the beanstalk at time t, h0 is the initial height (4 feet), and t is the number of days.

We want to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet, so we set up the inequality:

4 \* 2^t > 20

To solve for t, we can divide both sides by 4:

2^t > 5

Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides gives us:

t > log2(5)

Using a calculator, we find that log2(5) ≈ 2.32. Since t must be an integer (we can't have a fraction of a day), we round up to the nearest whole number:

t > 3

Therefore, it will take at least 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms daily, we first need to establish the protein content per gram of mushrooms. Given that a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein content per gram of mushrooms as follows:

Protein per gram = Total protein / Total weight
= 3 grams / 100 grams
= 0.03 grams per gram

Now, we can find the daily protein intake by multiplying the weight of mushrooms John eats by the protein content per gram:

Daily protein intake = Weight of mushrooms * Protein per gram
= 200 grams * 0.03 grams/gram
= 6 grams

To find the weekly protein intake, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7:

Weekly protein intake = Daily protein intake * 7
= 6 grams * 7
= 42 grams

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's analyze the problem: Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. We can represent Jerry's current age as 'x'. This situation can be modeled using a linear equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To determine the number of hours George needs to work to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000. Since he needs 2 implants, the total base price is 2 × $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already paid a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since he makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $\frac{\$3900}{\$15} = 260$ hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{260}$"
"Given the problem, we can denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it is 3x.

The sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the given coins into their respective values in cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, we add these values together to find the total amount of money Colby has:
Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15
= 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

The final answer is: 69"
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and sum them together.

First, let's consider the number of legs for each type of pet. Dogs have 4 legs each, cats have 4 legs each, and birds have 2 legs each.

We can represent the number of legs for each type of pet as follows:

- Dogs: 5 x 4 = 20 legs
- Cats: 2 x 4 = 8 legs
- Birds: 10 x 2 = 20 legs

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds and add it to 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds is calculated as follows: 0.5 × 8 = 4 pounds.

Adding 4 pounds to 8 pounds gives us 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since Jamaal then uses a weight two pounds lighter than this, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

Therefore, the weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he gets each year and add them up.

Let's break it down year by year:

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 12 = 22 games in the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 5 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 24 = 29 games in the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 5 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 48 = 53 games in the third year.

Now, let's add up the total number of games Steve gets in 3 years: 22 + 29 + 53 = 104 games.

The final answer is: 104"
"To determine the time it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we need to calculate the rate of the plane first.

The rate of the plane can be calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, the additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles is 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds made by Ruiz and Marissa together in 12 hours, we need to determine their individual hourly production rates and then multiply these rates by the number of hours worked.

Ruiz's hourly production rate can be found by dividing his total production by the number of hours worked. Since he produces 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, his hourly rate is 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa's hourly production rate is 3/4 times Ruiz's rate. To find her rate, we multiply Ruiz's rate by 3/4: 60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total production for each person over 12 hours by multiplying their hourly rates by the number of hours worked: Ruiz's total production = 60 * 12 = 720 pounds, and Marissa's total production = 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is the sum of their individual productions: 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"

- On Monday, Howard spent $8.
- On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, which is 2 × $8 = $16.
- On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is 4 × $16 = $64.

The total amount spent is the sum of these expenses: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount to find out how much money Howard has left:
$100 - $88 = $12.

Therefore, Howard has $12 left."
"To calculate the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we need to calculate the total number of cups sold and the total amount earned from each period, then add them together.

Let's break it down:

For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. The total number of cups sold in this period is given by the product of the number of cups sold per hour and the number of hours:

$$\text{Total cups sold in 4 hours} = 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups}$$

The total amount earned in this period is the product of the total number of cups sold and the price per cup:

$$\text{Total amount earned in 4 hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30$$

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup. The total number of cups sold in this period is given by the product of the number of cups sold per hour and the number of hours:

$$\text{Total cups sold in 2 hours} = 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups}$$

The total amount earned in this period is the product of the total number of cups sold and the price per cup:

$$\text{Total amount earned in 2 hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12$$

The total amount earned in 6 hours is the sum of the amounts earned in each period:

$$\text{Total amount earned in 6 hours} = \$30 + \$12 = \$42$$

"To determine the lifespan of the tires, we need to calculate the total number of rotations they can undergo before needing replacement and then divide that by the number of rotations per month.

Given that the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can find the total number of rotations per mile by taking the reciprocal of 2. 

Rotations per mile = 1 / 2 = 0.5

Now, we can find the total number of rotations per month by multiplying the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per mile.

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile * 0.5
Rotations per month = 145,000 rotations/month

Next, we need to find out how many months the tires can last before they need to be replaced. 

Total rotations allowed = 10,440,000 rotations
Rotations per month = 145,000 rotations/month

Months before replacement = Total rotations allowed / Rotations per month
Months before replacement = 10,440,000 / 145,000
Months before replacement = 72

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the number of years by dividing the total months by 12.

Years before replacement = Months before replacement / 12
Years before replacement = 72 / 12
Years before replacement = 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the cost per pump of the shampoo, we need to calculate the total number of pumps in the bottle and then divide the total cost by that number.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo yield 120 washings. Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps:

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
= 2400 cents / 240 pumps
= 10 cents per pump

Therefore, the cost per pump of the shampoo is 10 cents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and subtract it from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt:
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt:
Discounted price of the shirt = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
Total cost = Discounted price of the shirt + Price of the shorts
Total cost = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we don't need to calculate it separately.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Joe will have left:
Amount left = Initial amount - Total cost
Amount left = $50 - $52.50 = -$2.50

Since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Joe does not have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: -$2.50"
"To determine the amount of butter needed to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants. Since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, we multiply the number of dozen croissants by 12.

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen
28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Now, we need to find the amount of butter required to make 336 croissants. It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter per dozen:

336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

Therefore, the total amount of butter needed to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week is 84 pounds.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the cost difference in repaving Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

The cost per meter to repave a street is $194. Monica's street is 150 meters long, and Lewis' street is 490 meters long.

First, let's calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:

Cost to repave Monica's street = Cost per meter × Length of Monica's street
= $194 × 150
= $29,100

Next, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:

Cost to repave Lewis' street = Cost per meter × Length of Lewis' street
= $194 × 490
= $95,060

Now, we find the difference in cost by subtracting the cost to repave Monica's street from the cost to repave Lewis' street:

Difference in cost = Cost to repave Lewis' street - Cost to repave Monica's street
= $95,060 - $29,100

The final answer is: $65,960"
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial funding for the first 5 months and the increased funding for the remaining 45 months.

The initial funding for the first 5 months is a straightforward $100,000.

For the remaining 45 months, the funding increases by 50% of the initial funding. To calculate this, we find 50% of $100,000, which is 0.5 * $100,000 = $50,000. Adding this to the initial funding gives us the increased funding of $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000 per month.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the remaining 45 months by multiplying the increased funding by the number of months: $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

To find the total cost of the research, we add the cost for the first 5 months to the cost for the remaining 45 months: $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

The final answer is: $6,850,000"
"To determine the total amount of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to calculate the amount eaten by each player. 

The first player consumed 6 ounces of steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each weighing 1 ounce, so the total amount of beef tips consumed is 8 ounces. 
The third player consumed a 1-pound steak, which is equivalent to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

Now, let's add up the total amount of meat consumed: 
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

The total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To determine the total number of posts in March, we need to calculate the total number of posts per day and then multiply it by the number of days in March.

Given that there are 1000 members, each posting an average of 3 posts per day, we can calculate the total number of posts per day as follows:

Total posts per day = Number of members * Posts per member per day
= 1000 * 3
= 3000 posts/day

Now, we need to determine the number of days in March. Since March has 31 days, we can calculate the total number of posts in March by multiplying the total number of posts per day by the number of days in March:

Total posts in March = Total posts per day * Number of days in March
= 3000 * 31
= 93,000 posts

Therefore, the total number of posts in March is 93,000."
"To determine the annual cost of water for laundry, we need to calculate the total amount of water used in a year and then multiply it by the cost of a gallon of water.

Gary does laundry twice a week, which translates to 2 loads per week. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads done in a year is 2 * 52 = 104 loads.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water. Therefore, the total amount of water used in a year is 104 loads * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons.

The cost of a gallon of water is $0.15. To find the total cost, we multiply the total gallons used by the cost per gallon: 2080 gallons * $0.15/gallon = $312.

The final answer is: $312"
"To calculate the total amount Scarlett spent, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the items she purchased at the pet store. The cost of 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each is 2 × $2.50 = $5.00. The cost of 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each is 3 × $2.00 = $6.00. The cost of 20 fish at $0.50 each is 20 × $0.50 = $10.00. The cost of the fish food is $2.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the aquarium, which is $10.00, to the total cost of the items she purchased at the pet store: $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $23.00. Adding the cost of the aquarium to this total, we get $23.00 + $10.00 = $33.00.

"To determine the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat he sells in a day and then divide the total weight of the bull's meat by that amount.

Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so he sells 15 kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150 kg/day.

The bull weighs 750 kg. To find out how many days it will take to sell the meat, we divide the total weight of the bull's meat by the amount of meat Prince sells per day: 750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days.

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. Since there are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, we can find the total by multiplying the number of rows by the number of seats per row.

Total seats = 4 rows × 18 seats/row = 4 × 18 = 72 seats

Next, we determine the number of seats occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the total seats are occupied by the administrators, which can be calculated as follows:

Administrators = 1/4 × 72 = 72 × 1/4 = 72 × (1/4) = 18 seats

Now, we find the remaining seats after subtracting the seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats:

Remaining seats = Total seats - Administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

Then, we calculate the number of seats occupied by the parents. One-third of the remaining seats are occupied by the parents, which can be calculated as follows:

Parents = 1/3 × 54 = 54 × 1/3 = 54 × (1/3) = 18 seats

Finally, we find the number of seats occupied by the students by subtracting the seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:

Students = Remaining seats - Parents = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

"To determine the total number of functioning street lights, we need to calculate the total number of street lights and then subtract the number of non-functioning lights.

First, we calculate the total number of poles at all intersections. Since each intersection has 6 poles and there are 4 intersections, the total number of poles is 6 * 4 = 24.

Next, we calculate the total number of street lights. Each pole has 4 street lights, so the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

Now, we subtract the number of non-functioning lights from the total number of street lights to find the number of functioning lights: 96 - 20 = 76.

The final answer is: 76"
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining number of plays for each DVD and then sum those values.

Let's denote the number of times DVD 1 can be played as $P_1$ and the number of times DVD 2 can be played as $P_2$. We know that each DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks. Therefore, we have:

$P_1 = 1000 - 356 = 644$

$P_2 = 1000 - 135 = 865$

Now, we add the remaining times for both DVDs to find the total number of times they can be played:

$P_{\text{total}} = P_1 + P_2 = 644 + 865 = 1509$

The final answer is: $\boxed{1509}$"
"To determine the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours he attended physical therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

The number of weeks John attended physical therapy is given as 6. Since he attended physical therapy twice a week, the total number of sessions is 6 weeks * 2 sessions/week = 12 sessions. Each session lasted for 2 hours, so the total number of hours is 12 sessions * 2 hours/session = 24 hours.

The cost per hour of physical therapy is $125. To find the total cost, we multiply the total hours by the cost per hour: 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000.

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000.

The final answer is: $3000"
"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews and subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours and the school day lasts 8 hours, we can find the number of pieces he chews at school by dividing the total school hours by 2.

$$\frac{8}{2} = 4$$

In addition to the pieces he chews at school, Jim also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner. Therefore, the total number of pieces he chews is:

$$4 + 1 + 1 = 6$$

Now, let's subtract the total number of pieces he chews from the initial amount of gum:

$$20 - 6 = 14$$

However, Jim also gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. To find the number of pieces he gives to his sister, we divide the remaining gum by 2:

$$\frac{14}{2} = 7$$

Now, we subtract the number of pieces he gives to his sister from the remaining gum:

$$14 - 7 = 7$$

Therefore, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we need to calculate her current age first. Since she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can find her current age by subtracting 12 from 16.

16 - 12 = 4

Now, we add 4 to her current age to find out how old she will be 4 years from now:

4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the difference in the amounts spent by the two coaches, we need to calculate the total expenditures for each. 

The baseball coach purchased 9 baseballs at $3 each, so the total expenditure is 9 × 3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each, so the total expenditure is 8 × 14 = $112.

Now, we find the difference between the two amounts: $112 - $27 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"To determine the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden, we first calculate the total number of flowers. Given that there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, the total number of flowers is the product of these two quantities.

Total flowers = 10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 10 * 20 = 200 flowers

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we can find the number of bloomed flowers by multiplying the total number of flowers by 4/5.

Number of bloomed flowers = (4/5) * 200 = (4 * 200) / 5 = 800 / 5 = 160

Therefore, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kb/s to Mb/h, we need to perform a two-step conversion. First, we convert from kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000, since there are 1000 kilobytes (kb) in 1 megabyte (Mb).

Let's denote Ashley's internet connection speed as $s$ in kb/s. We have:

$$s = 20 \text{ kb/s}$$

Converting to Mb/s:
$$s_{\text{Mb/s}} = \frac{s}{1000} = \frac{20}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s}$$

Next, we convert from Mb/s to Mb/h by multiplying by the number of seconds in an hour, which is 3600 s/h.

$$s_{\text{Mb/h}} = s_{\text{Mb/s}} \times 3600 = 0.02 \times 3600 = 72 \text{ Mb/h}$$

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb/h.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the truck, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, we determine the number of cars towed on the first three days. Since the truck pulled 10 cars each day for three days, we can express this as a simple multiplication problem: 10 * 3 = 30.

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining days. There are 7 days in a week, and the truck towed cars for 3 days at the initial rate. Therefore, the remaining days are 7 - 3 = 4 days. On each of these days, the truck towed 4 fewer cars, so the number of cars towed on each of these days is 10 - 4 = 6. To find the total number of cars towed on the remaining days, we multiply the number of cars towed per day by the number of days: 6 * 4 = 24.

Now, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining days to find the total: 30 + 24 = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height and his current height, then divide by his growth rate.

First, let's convert the required height from feet to inches, as Adam's height is given in inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches as follows:

4 feet × 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we can calculate the difference in height:

48 inches (required height) - 40 inches (Adam's current height) = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can find the number of years it will take for him to reach the required height by dividing the difference in height by his growth rate:

8 inches ÷ 2 inches/year = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to reach the required height to ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine James' earnings, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars and then calculate his commission on that profit.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars: 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000.

Next, we need to calculate the company's cost to acquire the cars, which is 30% of the total cost. To find 30% of $250,000, we multiply $250,000 by 0.3, which is equivalent to multiplying by 30/100 or 3/10. This gives us:

$250,000 * (3/10) = $250,000 * 0.3 = $75,000

Now, we can calculate the profit from selling the cars by subtracting the company's cost from the total cost: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, we need to calculate James' commission on the profit, which is 10% of the profit. To find 10% of $175,000, we multiply $175,000 by 0.1, which is equivalent to multiplying by 10/100 or 1/10. This gives us:

$175,000 * (1/10) = $175,000 * 0.1 = $17,500

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright and then determine the proportion of men among them.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we calculate this as:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate this as:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15

Now, to find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Given that the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000, and the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Let G represent the price of the gold Jewell and D represent the price of the diamond Jewell. Then, we have:

G = (4/5)D

Substituting the given value of D, we get:

G = (4/5)(2000)
G = 1600

Given that the cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Let S represent the price of the silver Jewell. Then, we have:

S = G - 400
S = 1600 - 400
S = 1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = D + G + S
= 2000 + 1600 + 1200
= 4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of truck and rose stamps. 

Let's start with the snowflake stamps. Max bought 16 of these. 

The number of truck stamps is 3 more than the number of snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.

The number of rose stamps is 9 fewer than the number of truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"Given that Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, who is driving at a speed of 70 miles per hour, while Bob is driving at a speed of 55 miles per hour, we can model this situation using the concept of relative motion.

Let's denote the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob as 't' hours. The distance between them decreases at a rate equal to the difference in their speeds, which is 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph.

The distance between them decreases at a rate of 15 miles per hour, and the initial distance is 75 miles. We can use the formula:

Distance = Speed × Time

Since the distance is decreasing at a rate of 15 mph, we can set up the equation:

75 = 15t

To solve for 't', we divide both sides by 15:

t = 75 / 15
t = 5

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of fish Tommy caught, we need to establish the number of fish Darren caught first. Since Darren's catch is 6 less than Naomi's, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can express this relationship as:

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. This can be represented as:

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny attends at $6 per class as x and the number of classes he attends at $10 per class as y. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

The equation representing this situation is:

6x + 10y = 60

Since Manny can't attend a fraction of a class, we need to find the maximum whole number of classes he can attend at $6 per class.

We can start by trying different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

Let's try x = 0, 6(0) + 10y = 60
10y = 60
y = 6

However, this is not the maximum number of classes Manny can attend at $6 per class.

Let's try x = 1, 6(1) + 10y = 60
6 + 10y = 60
10y = 54
y = 5.4 (not a whole number)

Let's try x = 2, 6(2) + 10y = 60
12 + 10y = 60
10y = 48
y = 4.8 (not a whole number)

Let's try x = 3, 6(3) + 10y = 60
18 + 10y = 60
10y = 42
y = 4.2 (not a whole number)

Let's try x = 4, 6(4) + 10y = 60
24 + 10y = 60
10y = 36
y = 3.6 (not a whole number)

Let's try x = 5, 6(5) + 10y = 60
30 + 10y = 60
10y = 30
y = 3

Since x = 5 and y = 3 is a whole number solution, Manny can attend 5 classes at $6 per class and 3 classes at $10 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to calculate their individual daily and weekly production rates.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, so her daily production rate is 2 * 50 = 100 customers. Therefore, Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"Let's break down the problem using algebraic expressions. 

Let's denote the number of miles Lynn ran as L, Reggie ran as R, and Paisley ran as P. We are given that Paisley ran 4 miles, so P = 4.

We are also given that Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so R = 5P = 5(4) = 20.

Furthermore, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so we can express this relationship as R = L + 3. Substituting the value of R, we get 20 = L + 3.

To find the value of L, we can solve the equation 20 = L + 3 for L. Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get L = 20 - 3 = 17.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of 5 apples. Since we know the cost of 4 apples is $5.20, we can use the concept of proportionality to find the cost of 5 apples. We can set up a proportion: 4 apples / $5.20 = 5 apples / x, where x is the cost of 5 apples.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 4x = 5 * $5.20. Then, we divide both sides by 4 to isolate x: x = (5 * $5.20) / 4 = $6.50.

Next, let's find the cost of 5 oranges. We know the cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so we can use the same concept of proportionality: 3 oranges / $3.30 = 5 oranges / y, where y is the cost of 5 oranges.

To solve for y, we can cross-multiply: 3y = 5 * $3.30. Then, we divide both sides by 3 to isolate y: y = (5 * $3.30) / 3 = $5.50.

Now, we can add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To calculate the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to determine the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the hole, is given by the formula:

V = lwh

where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth) of the prism.

Given that the length (l) is 6 feet, the width (w) is 4 feet, and the depth (h) is 3 feet, we can calculate the volume as follows:

V = lwh
V = 6 * 4 * 3
V = 72 cubic feet

Now, we need to find the time it takes to dig the hole. Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

Time = V * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

The final answer is: 216"
"To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $\frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To determine Tim's total annual income, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 \* $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary:
Bonus = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly income:
Total monthly income = New monthly salary + Bonus = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

Finally, let's calculate the total annual income:
Total annual income = Total monthly income \* 12 = $31,000 \* 12 = $372,000

The final answer is: $372,000"
"To calculate the total cost of James' wardrobe, we need to break down the expenses into individual components.

First, let's find the cost of the suits: 10 suits * $750 = $7500.

Next, we need to determine the cost of the dress pants. Since they cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit, we can express this as a fraction: 1/5 * $750 = $150. Therefore, the cost of 10 dress pants is 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 shirts per suit, and he buys 10 suits. So, the total number of shirts is 10 * 3 = 30. The cost of each shirt is $60, so the total cost of the shirts is 30 * $60 = $1800.

To find the total cost, we add up the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final answer is: $10800"
"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to consider the daily publication rates and the number of days in the month.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and the sister company publishes 10 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, we can calculate the total number of articles published by each website as follows:

Total articles published by the news website = 20 articles/day * 28 days
= 20 * 28
= 560 articles

Total articles published by the sister company = 10 articles/day * 28 days
= 10 * 28
= 280 articles

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites to find the overall total:
Total articles = 560 articles (news website) + 280 articles (sister company)
= 840 articles

"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to break down the information given and solve it step by step.

Let's denote Steve's age as S, his wife's age as W, their son's age as C, and their son's wife's age as SW.

We know that S = 60.

We are also given that W = S + 4, so W = 60 + 4 = 64.

Since their son is half as old as his mom, C = W / 2 = 64 / 2 = 32.

Lastly, we are told that SW = C - 3, so SW = 32 - 3 = 29.

Therefore, the age of Steve's son's wife is 29.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to calculate the total amount of flour in one bag and then multiply it by 3.

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion: 8 × 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, to find the total amount of flour in three bags, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3: 16 × 3 = 48 kilograms.

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms.

The final answer is: 48"
"To calculate the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate their individual distances and then sum them.

Alisa's distance can be calculated using the formula: distance = speed × time. Given her speed is 12 miles per hour and she biked for 4.5 hours, we can calculate her distance as follows:

distance = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours
= 12 × 4.5
= 54 miles

Stanley's distance can be calculated using the same formula. Given his speed is 10 miles per hour and he biked for 2.5 hours, we can calculate his distance as follows:

distance = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours
= 10 × 2.5
= 25 miles

Now, to find the total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley, we add their individual distances:

total distance = Alisa's distance + Stanley's distance
= 54 miles + 25 miles
= 79 miles

The final answer is: 79"
"To determine the time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add them together.

The rate at which Bill digs through soil is 4 feet per hour. To find the time it takes to dig through 24 feet of soil, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time = 6 hours

The rate at which Bill digs through clay is half that of soil, which is 2 feet per hour. To find the time it takes to dig through 8 feet of clay, we can use the same formula:

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time = 4 hours

Now, we can add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay to find the total time:

Total Time = Time through soil + Time through clay
Total Time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total Time = 10 hours

Therefore, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of individuals who will be receiving the treats. This includes Howie himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.

Let's denote the total number of people as 'n'. We can express this as:

n = 1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates)

n = 1 + 1 + 25
n = 27

Since Howie wants to provide one vanilla and one chocolate cupcake for each person, we need to multiply the total number of people by 2.

Total cupcakes = 2n
Total cupcakes = 2(27)
Total cupcakes = 54

Therefore, Howie should purchase 54 cupcakes.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the sequence of events and apply basic arithmetic operations.

Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes on her Instagram post. Three weeks later, the number of likes increased to 70 times the initial number of likes. This means the number of likes after 3 weeks is 70 * 2000 = 140000.

However, we are not given the number of likes received in the 3-week period. Instead, we are told that 20000 more new likes were received recently. To find the total number of likes, we need to add these new likes to the number of likes after 3 weeks.

Let's calculate the total number of likes:

Total likes = Number of likes after 3 weeks + New likes
Total likes = 140000 + 20000
Total likes = 160000

Therefore, the total number of likes on Fishio's Instagram post is 160000.

The final answer is: 160000"
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two costs.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off because she had a voucher. The total cost is:
\[ 20 \times 20 - 2 = 398 \]

On the second day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost without the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]
The discount is 10% of $600, which is:
\[ 600 \times 0.1 = 60 \]
So, the total cost with the discount is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

The final answer is: $142"
"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic notation.

Let G represent the total sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats in the first month are half the total sales from green hats, we can express this as:

R = G/2

We are given that R = $400. To find G, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

G/2 = 400
G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month are $800, and the total sales from red hats are $400.

The total sales in the first month are the sum of the sales from green and red hats:

T1 = G + R
T1 = 800 + 400
T1 = 1200

In the second month, the sales are 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:

T2 = (3/4) * T1
T2 = (3/4) * 1200
T2 = 900

To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months:

T_total = T1 + T2
T_total = 1200 + 900

"To determine the total cost of hiring the horse-drawn carriage, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the total cost of those hours.

The carriage was hired from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, James receives 1 hour of free service, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost of the first hour is $15. Each subsequent hour costs twice the cost of the first hour, which is 2 * $15 = $30.

Therefore, the total cost is $15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $30 (third hour) = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we need to calculate the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount she received.

Let's denote Sally's expected wage as E, the initial amount in her account as I, and the actual amount in her account as A. We are given that E = $300, I = $200, and A = $420.

The expected total amount in her account, if she received her full wage, can be calculated as E + I = $300 + $200 = $500.

To find the amount withheld, we subtract the actual amount from the expected total: Withheld = E + I - A = $500 - $420.

Performing the subtraction, we get: Withheld = $80.

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Lori needs, we must first calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required for her guests. 

Given that each guest will consume 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests, we can find the total number of deviled egg halves needed by multiplying the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves per guest.

Total deviled egg halves = Number of guests × Number of deviled egg halves per guest
Total deviled egg halves = 16 × 3
Total deviled egg halves = 48

Since each egg yields 2 deviled egg halves, we can find the total number of eggs needed by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.

Total eggs = Total deviled egg halves ÷ 2
Total eggs = 48 ÷ 2
Total eggs = 24

To find the number of dozens of eggs needed, we divide the total number of eggs by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen.

Number of dozens of eggs = Total eggs ÷ 12
Number of dozens of eggs = 24 ÷ 12
Number of dozens of eggs = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we can use the concept of fractions. Since she has completed 1/3 of the paper, we can find the number of pages left by subtracting the completed portion from the total.

Let's denote the total number of pages as T. We know that Shiela has completed 1/3 of the paper, so the number of pages completed is (1/3)T. To find the number of pages left, we subtract this from the total:

Pages left = T - (1/3)T
Pages left = (2/3)T

Given that the total number of pages is 15, we can substitute T = 15 into the equation:

Pages left = (2/3)(15)
Pages left = 2 * 5
Pages left = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the number of days before the deadline that Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the time it will take him to complete the book.

Given:
- Total pages in the book: 200
- Pages read per day: 10

We can calculate the number of days it will take Mike to finish the book by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day.

Days to finish the book = Total pages / Pages read per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we can find the number of days before the deadline by subtracting the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the total number of days.

Days before the deadline = Total days - Days to finish the book
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase price, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly hanger rental is $5,000. To find the total hanger rental cost for a year, we multiply this by 12: $5,000 * 12 = $60,000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000. To find the total fuel cost for a year, we multiply this by 12: $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, we add the initial purchase price, the hanger rental cost, and the fuel cost to find the total cost for the first year: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic notation. 

Let's denote the cooking time for rice as $r$, the cooking time for pork as $p$, and the cooking time for beans as $b$. We are given the following information:

1. $r = 30$ minutes (given)
2. $p = r + 20$ minutes (pork takes 20 more minutes than rice)
3. $b = \frac{1}{2}(p + r)$ minutes (beans take half the combined cooking time of pork and rice)

Substituting the value of $r$ into equation (2), we get $p = 30 + 20 = 50$ minutes.

Now, substitute the values of $r$ and $p$ into equation (3) to find $b$:
$b = \frac{1}{2}(50 + 30) = \frac{1}{2}(80) = 40$ minutes

To find the total cooking time, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:
Total cooking time $= r + p + b = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120$ minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find the cost of each mixture, we need to calculate the cost of almonds and walnuts separately and then add them together.

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: \frac{1}{2} \cdot 10 = 5
- Cost of walnuts: \frac{1}{3} \cdot 15 = 5
- Total cost of the first mixture: 5 + 5 = 10

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: \frac{1}{5} \cdot 10 = 2
- Cost of walnuts: \frac{1}{3} \cdot 15 = 5
- Total cost of the second mixture: 2 + 5 = 7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
Difference = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture
Difference = 10 - 7
Difference = 3

The final answer is: $3"
"Given the problem, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationship between the number of sheep (S) and geese (G) on Lee's farm.

Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as:

4S + 2G = 70

Since each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, the total number of heads can be represented as:

S + G = 20

We can solve the second equation for G:

G = 20 - S

Substituting G = 20 - S into the first equation, we get:

4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

Expanding the equation, we get:

4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Combining like terms, we get:

2S + 40 = 70

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:

2S = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

S = 15

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of Roger's purchase, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but since his favorite brand was sold out, he had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate 20% of $5 and add it to the original price.

20% of $5 is calculated as 0.20 * $5 = $1. 
Therefore, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week. The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

The cost of the donut is $2.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the coffee and the donut: $42 + $2 = $44.

The cost of the apple pie is $7.00."
"To determine the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. Given that James delivers 600 newspapers in total, and we know the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C, we can calculate the number of newspapers delivered to District B by subtracting the sum of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total.

Let's denote the number of newspapers delivered to District B as x. We can express this as an equation:

x = 600 - (198 + 209)

To solve for x, we need to evaluate the expression within the parentheses first. This involves adding 198 and 209.

198 + 209 = 407

Now, we can rewrite the equation as:

x = 600 - 407

To find the value of x, we subtract 407 from 600.

x = 600 - 407
x = 193

Therefore, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine the number of recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total class time and then divide it by the time it takes to learn a new recipe.

"To find the number of math teachers, we need to determine the percentage of teachers that are not history teachers. Since 60% of the teachers are history teachers, the remaining percentage of math teachers is:

100% - 60% = 40%

Now, we can calculate the number of math teachers as follows:

Number of math teachers = 40% of 150
= 0.4 * 150
= 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

Total time = Number of math teachers * Hours slept per day
= 60 * 6
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"Given the scenario, we can establish the following relationships between the individuals' amounts of money:

Let A be the amount of money Aurelia has, K be the amount of money Kassidy has, and R be the amount of money Rayna has.

We are given that A = 120, K = (3/4)A, and R = K + 60.

Substituting the value of A into the equation for K, we get K = (3/4)(120) = 90.

Now, we can find the value of R by substituting the value of K into the equation for R: R = 90 + 60 = 150.

To find the total amount of money, we add the individual amounts together: Total = A + K + R = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360.

Finally, to determine the amount each person would have if they shared the total amount equally, we divide the total by 3: Money per person = Total / 3 = 360 / 3 = 120.

The final answer is: $120"

"Given that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has, we can express this relationship as an equation. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. Then, the number of books Janey has can be represented as 2x + 3.

We are given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to isolate 'x':

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To determine the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we first need to establish the current height in inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the initial height of 20 feet to inches as follows:

20 feet × 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Given that the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, we can calculate the number of days required to reach the target height by dividing the difference by the growth rate:

360 inches ÷ 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take the bamboo 12 days to reach a height of 600 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, let's analyze the situation step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. With 8 more dogs in the shelter, he needs 8 additional toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 4 (initial toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys.

When James returns, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 8 dogs initially, there are now 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs. The total number of dogs is now 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (initial additional dogs) + 16 (new dogs) = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 12 (initial toys) + 28 (additional toys) = 40 toys.

However, when James returns again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 40 (total toys needed so far) - 3 (toys no longer needed) = 37 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{37}$"
"To determine Skyler's investment, we need to calculate the remaining amount after Dylan and Frances invested.

First, let's find the amount Dylan invested: $\frac{2}{5}$ of $1200 is equivalent to $\frac{2}{5} \cdot 1200 = 480$. This is a straightforward application of the distributive property of multiplication over addition.

Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the initial amount to find the remaining amount: $1200 - 480 = 720$. This is a basic subtraction operation.

Next, we calculate Frances' investment: $\frac{2}{3}$ of 720 is equivalent to $\frac{2}{3} \cdot 720 = 480$. This is another straightforward application of the distributive property of multiplication over addition.

Finally, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find Skyler's investment: $720 - 480 = 240$.

"To determine the number of signatures the sisters need to collect to reach their goal, we first calculate the total number of signatures they have collected so far. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures.

Total signatures so far = 20 + 44 = 64

The sisters want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need to collect, we subtract the total signatures they have from their goal.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36

Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, we can calculate the number of signatures they need to collect per week to reach their goal by dividing the total signatures needed by the number of weeks remaining.

Signatures needed per week = 36 / 3 = 12

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 12 signatures per week for the remaining three weeks to reach their goal of 100 signatures.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine Karen's earnings in two days, we first need to calculate her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage is 2 * $10 = $20.

Next, we calculate the total hours Karen works in two days. Given that she works 3 hours per day, her total hours worked in two days is 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate Karen's earnings by multiplying her hourly wage by the total hours worked: $20 * 6 = $120.

"To determine the excess weight, we need to calculate the total weight of the 9 adults and then subtract the maximum load of the elevator.

The weight of one adult is given as 80 kg. To find the total weight of 9 adults, we multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults.

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9
Total weight of 9 adults = 720 kg

Now, we need to find the difference between the total weight of the 9 adults and the maximum load of the elevator, which is 700 kg.

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

Therefore, the excess weight is 20 kg.

"Let's break down the problem using algebraic equations. We can represent the number of cookies each person has as variables: K for Katarina, M for Max, C for the Cookie Monster, and S for Summer.

We are given the following information:

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: K = M - 5
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: M = C + 12
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: S = M + 23
4. Katarina has 68 cookies: K = 68

We can substitute the value of K into the first equation to find the value of M:
68 = M - 5
M = 68 + 5
M = 73

Now that we have the value of M, we can find the value of C:
73 = C + 12
C = 73 - 12
C = 61

Finally, we can find the value of S:
S = M + 23
S = 73 + 23
S = 96

Now that we have the values of K, M, C, and S, we can find the total number of cookies:
Total = K + M + C + S
Total = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
Total = 298

"To find the original length of the dress, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the original length of the dress as 'x'. 

The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, which is equivalent to 0.5x. Additionally, 20cm is added to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the total length of the extended dress is x + 0.5x + 20.

We are given that the final design is 140cm long. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 0.5x + 20 = 140

Combine like terms:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

"To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took for each mode and then add them together.

First, let's convert the time it took to mow the lawn in turtle mode to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can express this as:

Time in turtle mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes

Next, we know that Chris mowed half the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode. Therefore, we can calculate the time it took for each mode by multiplying the time for each mode by 0.5 (half).

Time in turtle mode = 60 minutes * 0.5 = 30 minutes
Time in rabbit mode = 40 minutes * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = Time in turtle mode + Time in rabbit mode
           = 30 minutes + 20 minutes
           = 50 minutes

Let's start by calculating the total number of cookies baked. Greta bakes 30 cookies, and Celinda bakes twice as many, which is 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies is the sum of Greta's and Celinda's cookies: 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

Now, we need to subtract the number of cookies they eat, which is 10. So, the number of cookies left in the box is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

Therefore, the correct answer is 80."
"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

We have two equations based on the given information:

1. The sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44: T + (T+7) + t = 44
2. The older twin is 7 years older than the triplet: T+7 = t+7

We can simplify the second equation to find the relationship between T and t: T = t

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3t = 37

Divide by 3: t = 37/3

Simplify the fraction: t = 12.33

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, the problem asks for the age of one of the twins, and since we have two twins, we need to find the age of the older twin.

The age of the older twin is T+7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"

First, let's calculate the total time John has before dinner in minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Next, we'll add up the time John spends on homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, we'll subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner: 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes available for a nap."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We are given that Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for a total of $3.20. The cost of each lollipop is $0.40. We can represent this information using the following system of linear equations:

Let L be the cost of one lollipop and C be the cost of one candy. We have:

5L + 4C = 3.20  ... (Equation 1)
L = 0.40  ... (Equation 2)

We can substitute the value of L from Equation 2 into Equation 1 to solve for C:

5(0.40) + 4C = 3.20
2.00 + 4C = 3.20
4C = 1.20
C = 0.30

Now that we have the cost of one candy, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

Cost of 10 lollipops = 10L = 10(0.40) = $4.00
Cost of 10 candies = 10C = 10(0.30) = $3.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. To find Neil's monthly savings, we need to calculate 2/5 of Rong's savings and add it to Rong's savings. This can be expressed as:

Neil's monthly savings = Rong's monthly savings + (2/5 * Rong's monthly savings)
= 20 + (2/5 * 20)
= 20 + 8
= 28 coins per month

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year = 28 * 12 = 336 coins

To find their total savings after 10 years, we multiply their yearly savings by 10:
Rong's total savings = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings = 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To determine the amount John leaves with after visiting the vet, we need to calculate the total bill and subtract it from the amount he brought.

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of its individual components. 

First, let's establish the cost of each fruit. Given that one apple costs $0.5, we can infer that the cost of one banana is twice that amount, which is $1. Since oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana, the cost of one orange is $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 \* $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 \* $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 \* $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color of squares and add them together.

Let's start by identifying the number of squares of each color:

- Red squares: 14
- Blue squares: 14 + 4 = 18
- Green squares: 18 + 6 = 24
- White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we add the number of squares of each color together:
14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"To determine the number of chairs Mia's restaurant needs to get, we must first calculate the total number of chairs required for the attendees. 

There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function. Since each adult and baby requires a chair, the total number of chairs needed is the sum of the number of adults and babies.

Total number of chairs needed = 42 (adults) + 15 (babies) = 57

The restaurant has 8 high chairs and 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. To find the number of regular chairs, we multiply the number of high chairs by 5.

Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 5 × 8 = 40

Total number of chairs available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

To find the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the total number of chairs available from the total number of chairs needed.

Number of chairs needed to be added = Total number of chairs needed - Total number of chairs available
= 57 - 48
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the number of 8-point bucks in the field, we need to calculate the percentage of bucks that are 8 points. 

First, we find the number of bucks, which is 50% of the total deer population. This can be calculated as 0.5 * 50 = 25 bucks.

Next, we need to find 20% of the bucks that are 8 points. This can be calculated as 0.2 * 25 = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total points collected by the class, we need to calculate the points collected by each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 0.3 by 50, which equals 15. Therefore, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. To find Tom's points, we subtract 30 from Betty's points: 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. To find Martha's points, we multiply Tom's points by 3: 3 * 35 = 105 points.

The total points collected by the class is the sum of the points collected by each student: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

To find out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold of 400 points: 400 - 255 = 145 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{145}$"
"The problem at hand is a classic example of exponential growth. We can model the number of great grand-babies using the concept of exponents. Let's break it down:

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children, which can be represented as 3^1.
2. Each of her children has 3 children, so we have 3^1 * 3^3 = 3^(1+3) = 3^4.
3. Each of her grandchildren has 3 babies, so we have 3^4 * 3^3 = 3^(4+3) = 3^7.

Therefore, the total number of great grand-babies is 3^7.

The final answer is: 3^7 = 2187"
"To determine the amount Greta has left to spend after funding her retirement account and making her car payment, we need to calculate the deductions from her paycheck.

First, let's calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account. This is a straightforward application of the percentage formula: 50% of $2400.00 is 0.5 × $2400.00 = $1200.00.

Next, we calculate the amount she uses for her car payment. This is another percentage calculation: 20% of $2400.00 is 0.2 × $2400.00 = $480.00.

Now, we subtract the total deductions from her paycheck: $2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00.

Therefore, Greta has $720.00 left to spend after funding her retirement account and making her car payment."
"To determine the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we must first calculate the number of pencils present in the box. Given that the box has a capacity for 20 pencils and 4 are missing, we can find the number of pencils in the box by subtracting the missing pencils from the total capacity.

Let's denote the total capacity of the box as C = 20 pencils and the number of missing pencils as M = 4. The number of pencils in the box, P, can be calculated as follows:

P = C - M
= 20 - 4
= 16

Now, to find the number of pairs of pencils, we divide the number of pencils in the box by 2, since a pair consists of 2 pencils.

Number of pairs of pencils = P / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

Therefore, the number of pairs of pencils in the box is 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 × 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which is the decimal equivalent of 40%. This gives us 300 × 0.4 = 120.

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks from Hannah's backyard display. She will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard display is 3 × 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display: 120 + 15 = 135.

The final answer is: 135"
"To determine the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks purchased and then multiply it by the cost per item.

Let's denote the number of people as $n$. In this scenario, $n = 19$ since Aiden and his 12 friends, plus 7 more friends, equals 19 people.

Each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks. Therefore, the total number of drinks and snacks bought is $2n$ (drinks) + $3n$ (snacks) = $5n$ items.

The cost per item is $2. So, the total amount spent on snacks and drinks is $5n \cdot 2 = 10n$.

Substituting $n = 19$ into the equation, we get $10 \cdot 19 = 190$.

The final answer is: $190"
"Let's denote the capacity of Gissela's truck as G, Gordy's truck as H, and Gary's truck as Y. We are given the following information:

1. G = 4,000 pounds
2. H = G + 800 pounds
3. G + H + Y = 11,600 pounds

We can substitute the value of G into the second equation to find H:
H = 4,000 + 800
H = 4,800 pounds

Now, we can substitute the values of G and H into the third equation to find Y:
4,000 + 4,800 + Y = 11,600

Combine like terms:
8,800 + Y = 11,600

Subtract 8,800 from both sides:
Y = 11,600 - 8,800
Y = 2,800 pounds

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2800}$"
"To determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we need to consider the number of dumplings eaten by each individual and the total number of people.

Let's denote the number of dumplings eaten by each female as F and the number of dumplings eaten by each male as M. We are given that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so M = F + 1.

We know that each female ate 3 dumplings, so F = 3. Therefore, M = 3 + 1 = 4.

The total number of females is 6, and the total number of males is 8. The total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6F = 6(3) = 18, and the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8M = 8(4) = 32.

The total number of dumplings eaten by all people is the sum of the dumplings eaten by females and males, which is 18 + 32 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"When dealing with ratios, it's essential to understand the concept of proportional parts. In this scenario, Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. To find Gerald's initial share, we can use the formula for finding a specific part of a ratio:

Gerald's initial amount = (Gerald's part / Total parts) * Total amount
= (3 / (3 + 2)) * 100
= (3 / 5) * 100
= 60

Now, we need to find out how much money Gerald had left after spending $10 on a book. We can simply subtract the amount spent from his initial amount:

Gerald's remaining amount = Gerald's initial amount - Amount spent
= 60 - 10
= 50

Therefore, Gerald had $50 left after spending $10 on a book.

The final answer is: $50"
"Given the speed of Martha's cat is 15 feet per second, and it is 5 times faster than her turtle, we can determine the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = Speed of the turtle * 40
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

Therefore, the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds is 120 feet."
"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we must first calculate the rate at which they are raising funds. 

Let's denote the total amount raised as $A, the number of hours they have already fundraised as h, and the rate at which they raise funds as r. We know that A = r * h. Given that they have raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can express this as 2100 = r * 3.

To find the rate r, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: r = 2100 / 3 = 700. This means they raise $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find the number of hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The total goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. The remaining amount is 6300 - 2100 = 4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the rate: 4200 / 700 = 6. Since they have already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours: 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to calculate the percentage of water used by the city and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

First, we find the percentage of water used by the city: 40% of the total water from the Colorado River.

Next, we calculate the percentage used for industrial purposes, which is 80% of the city's water usage: 0.8 * 40% = 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes: 40% - 32% = 8%.

Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks and then multiply it by her daily rate.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the total number of days in 2 weeks by multiplying 7 by 2:

7 days/week * 2 weeks = 14 days

Now, we multiply the total number of days by Alex's daily rate of $12:

14 days * $12/day = $168

Therefore, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"Given the production rates of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, we can establish a ratio of production for each flavor. The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours, which translates to a production rate of 50 quarts per hour for chocolate ice cream. Similarly, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is 50 quarts in 4 hours, or 12.5 quarts per hour.

To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we can calculate the production for each flavor separately and then sum the results. The production of chocolate ice cream in 48 hours is 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts. The production of vanilla ice cream in 48 hours is 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

Therefore, the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts.

The final answer is: 3000"
"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

The cost of croissants is 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.
The cost of cinnamon rolls is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00.
The cost of mini quiches is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.
The cost of blueberry muffins is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

The total cost before discount is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage: 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should buy, we need to consider the deal offered by the ice cream parlor. The deal states that for every 2 scoops purchased, Erin gets 1 scoop free. 

Let's denote the cost of each scoop as $1.50. Since Erin has $6.00, we can calculate the maximum number of scoops she can buy without considering the deal. 

The maximum number of scoops Erin can buy is given by the integer division of her total budget by the cost of each scoop:

$$\left\lfloor \frac{6.00}{1.50} \right\rfloor = 4$$

However, to take advantage of the deal, Erin should buy 2 scoops and get 1 free. This means she can get 3 scoops for the price of 2. 

To find out how many sets of 2 scoops Erin can buy, we divide her budget by the cost of 2 scoops:

$$\left\lfloor \frac{6.00}{2 \times 1.50} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{6.00}{3.00} \right\rfloor = 2$$

Since Erin can buy 2 sets of 2 scoops, she will get 2 x 1 = 2 free scoops. 

In total, Erin will get 2 x 2 + 2 = 6 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of candies Amy and Ginger have after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of candies each consumes in that time frame and then subtract that from their initial amount.

Let's denote the initial number of candies as I, the daily consumption rate of Ginger as G, and the daily consumption rate of Amy as A. We are given I = 100, G = 4, and A = 3. The time frame is two weeks, which is equivalent to 14 days.

The total number of candies consumed by Ginger in two weeks is G * 14 = 4 * 14 = 56.

The total number of candies consumed by Amy in two weeks is A * 14 = 3 * 14 = 42.

Now, we calculate the remaining candies for each person by subtracting their total consumption from the initial amount: 

Ginger's remaining candies = I - (G * 14) = 100 - 56 = 44.
Amy's remaining candies = I - (A * 14) = 100 - 42 = 58.

To find the difference in the number of candies Amy and Ginger have, we subtract Ginger's remaining candies from Amy's remaining candies: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we first need to calculate the area to be covered.

The area to be covered is two thirds of 36 sq ft, which can be expressed as (2/3) * 36. To simplify this, we can multiply the numerator (2) by 36 and then divide by the denominator (3).

(2/3) * 36 = (2 * 36) / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24

So, Mr. Boarden needs to cover 24 sq ft. 

For every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, for 24 sq ft, he would need 24 * 24 = 576 mosaic tiles.

The final answer is: 576"
"When it comes to calculating the cost of blueberries, it's essential to consider both the initial cost of picking and the per-pound cost. In this scenario, James incurs an initial cost of $20 to go blueberry picking, followed by an additional $1.5 per pound for the blueberries he picks. Given that he picked 30 pounds of blueberries, the total cost of picking can be calculated as follows:

Initial cost: $20
Per-pound cost: $1.5/pound * 30 pounds = $45
Total cost of picking: $20 + $45 = $65

Now, let's compare this to the cost of buying blueberries at the store, which is $2.5 per pound. The total cost of buying 30 pounds of blueberries at the store would be:

$2.5/pound * 30 pounds = $75

To determine the amount James saved by picking his own blueberries, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store:

$75 (store price) - $65 (picking price) = $10

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking his own blueberries.

The final answer is: $10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid for the computers, we need to first determine the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. To find the new price, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price. 

10% of $700 is calculated as 0.1 x 700 = $70. 

The new price of each computer is $700 + $70 = $770.

Now, we can find the total amount of money the company paid for 500 computers by multiplying the new price by the number of computers: 500 x $770 = $385,000.

The final answer is: $385,000"

"To determine the total number of chairs left, we need to calculate the difference between the initial number of chairs and the number of chairs sent for repair.

Let's start by identifying the initial number of chairs: 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs. 

The total number of chairs sent for repair is 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs. To find the total number of chairs sent for repair, we add these two quantities: 20 + 13 = 33.

Now, we need to subtract the total number of chairs sent for repair from the initial number of chairs. However, we must be careful with the order of operations. We should subtract the number of normal chairs sent for repair from the total number of normal chairs and the number of baby chairs sent for repair from the total number of baby chairs, then add the results.

Total normal chairs left = 170 - 20 = 150
Total baby chairs left = 23 - 13 = 10

"To find the total number of slices left, we first need to determine the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his friends. Since each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 5 people in total (Bryce and 4 friends), we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by these 5 people as follows:

Let's denote the total number of slices eaten by 5 people as $S_5$. Since 2/3 of their pizzas were eaten, we can express this as:

$$S_5 = 5 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot 12$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$S_5 = 5 \cdot 8 = 40$$

However, we know that 2 of these people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:

Let's denote the total number of slices eaten by 3 people as $S_3$. We can express this as:

$$S_3 = 3 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot 12$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$S_3 = 3 \cdot 8 = 24$$

Now, we subtract the number of slices eaten by 3 people from the total number of slices eaten by 5 people to find the number of slices eaten by the remaining 2 people:

$$S_5 - S_3 = 40 - 24 = 16$$

Now, we know that 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is:

$$2 \cdot 9 = 18$$

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:

Total number of slices = 5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices
Total number of slices eaten = 24 slices + 16 slices + 18 slices = 58 slices
Number of slices left = 60 slices - 58 slices = 2 slices

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Given that a cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes, we can establish the cat's rate of consumption as 9 sausages / 30 minutes. To find the time it takes for the dog to eat the same number of sausages, we need to determine the dog's rate of consumption, which is 2/3 of the cat's rate.

Let's calculate the dog's rate of consumption:

Dog's rate = (2/3) * (9 sausages / 30 minutes)
Dog's rate = (2/3) * (9/30) sausages/minute
Dog's rate = (2/3) * (3/10) sausages/minute
Dog's rate = 2/10 sausages/minute
Dog's rate = 1/5 sausages/minute

Now, we can find the time it takes for the dog to eat 9 sausages:

Time taken by dog = 9 sausages / (1/5 sausages/minute)
Time taken by dog = 9 * (1/1/5)
Time taken by dog = 9 * 5 minutes
Time taken by dog = 45 minutes

To find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog, we can use the formula:

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 45 minutes) / 2
Average time = 75 minutes / 2
Average time = 37.5 minutes

The final answer is: 37.5"
"Given the problem, we can establish an equation to represent the relationship between the length of Topher's shoe and Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. 

We are told that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:

x * 9 + 10 = 100

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation yields:

x * 9 = 90

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 9 to solve for 'x':

x = 90 / 9

x = 10

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars:
- Number of students' cars: 64
- Number of windows per car: 4
- Fraction of windows smashed: 1/4
- Total windows smashed from students' cars = (1/4) × (64 × 4) = (1/4) × 256 = 64

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars:
- Number of teachers' cars: 32
- Number of windows per car: 2
- Fraction of windows smashed: 3/4
- Total windows smashed from teachers' cars = (3/4) × (32 × 2) = (3/4) × 64 = 48

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars:
Total windows smashed = 64 + 48 = 112

The final answer is: $\boxed{112}$"
"To determine the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we need to calculate the ratio of blue spools to the total number of spools. 

First, let's find the total number of blue spools by adding the light blue and dark blue spools.

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we'll find the total number of spools by adding all the spools together.

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can calculate the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue is 40%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

First, let's find the number of people who voted by midday. We know that 2/5 of 5000 people had voted by then. 

$$\frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000$$

So, 2000 people voted by midday.

Now, we need to find the number of people who voted by 16:00. We know that 2/3 of the remaining people had voted by then. The number of people remaining after midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

$$\frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000$$

Therefore, 2000 more people voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00.

$$5000 - (2000 + 2000) = 5000 - 4000 = 1000$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we must first calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will consume during this period. Given that Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day, we can calculate the total number of pieces he will chew in 30 days as follows:

Total pieces of gum = 4 pieces/day * 30 days = 4 * 30 = 120 pieces

Next, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack to find out how many packs Parker will need. Since a pack of gum contains 15 pieces, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of packs = Total pieces of gum / Number of pieces per pack
= 120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack
= 120/15
= 8

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers required, we need to calculate the total number of smores needed. 

First, we calculate the total number of smores for the kids: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores.
Next, we calculate the total number of smores for the adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores.
The total number of smores required is the sum of the smores for kids and adults: 18 + 6 = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, we divide the total number of smores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed: 24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves.
Given that there are 3 sleeves in a box, we divide the number of sleeves needed by 3 to find the number of boxes required: 3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box.

Therefore, the number of boxes of graham crackers needed is 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"Given the problem, we can represent the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother using algebraic expressions.

Let D be Dora's age, F be her father's age, and M be her mother's age.

We are given that Dora's age is 15 years, so D = 15.

We are also given that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, which can be expressed as F = 2D + 8.

Substituting D = 15 into the expression for F, we get F = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38.

Furthermore, we are given that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, which can be expressed as M = F - 4.

Substituting F = 38 into the expression for M, we get M = 38 - 4 = 34.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their individual ages: D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34.

Simplifying the expression, we get D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87.

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87.

The final answer is: $\boxed{87}$"
"To determine the amount each of Greg's siblings received, we need to perform a simple division operation. The total amount of money is $20, and there are 3 siblings.

Each of Greg's siblings received $6.67."
"To determine the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we need to calculate the combined weight of all her books. 

First, let's consider the weights of her language books: French (4 pounds) and English (3 pounds). The total weight of these two books is 4 + 3 = 7 pounds.

Next, we need to calculate the weight of her math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds, the total weight of these two books is 2 x 2 = 4 pounds.

Lastly, we need to consider the weight of her history book, which is twice as heavy as her English book. Since the English book weighs 3 pounds, the history book weighs 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the books: 7 (language books) + 4 (math and science books) + 6 (history book) = 17 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A secured 20% of the total votes, which is equivalent to 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B, on the other hand, received 50% more votes than candidate A. This can be calculated as 20 + (50% of 20) = 20 + 0.5 * 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now, we know that the total number of votes is 100. The combined votes for candidates A and B amount to 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

To find the number of votes candidate C received, we subtract the combined votes of candidates A and B from the total number of votes: 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

Therefore, candidate C received 50 votes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic arithmetic operations. Let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. This means Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. To find Beck's new amount, we add 10 to 77:

77 + 10 = 87

Boris's new amount is 100 - 10 = 90 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's amount from Boris's amount:

90 - 87 = 3

Therefore, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now."
"To determine the amount of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial amount of water.

Let's start by calculating the total amount of water used for each type of cube:

- Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 3 × 4 = 12 ounces
- Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 7 × 2 = 14 ounces
- Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 8 × 0.5 = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

To find the amount of water left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's denote the number of books Steven has as S. We are given that Clara has two times as many books as Steven, so Clara's books can be represented as 2S. We also know Clara has 20 books, which gives us the equation 2S = 20. Solving for S, we get S = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now, we are given that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Therefore, Alice's books can be represented as S + 6. Substituting the value of S, we get Alice's books as 10 + 6 = 16.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we need to find the difference between Clara's and Alice's books, which is 2S - (S + 6). Substituting the value of S, we get 2(10) - (10 + 6) = 20 - 16 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and a half-gallon jar costs $2 less, we can determine the cost of a half-gallon jar by subtracting $2 from the cost of a gallon jar.

Cost of a gallon jar = $5
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2 = $3

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Total cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 × $5 = $50
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 × $3 = $48

To find the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we add the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Total amount of money Cecelia spent = Total cost of 10-gallon jars + Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total amount of money Cecelia spent = $50 + $48 = $98

"Given a class of 50 students with diverse hobbies, we have the following information:

- Students who like to bake = 10
- Students who like to play basketball = 5
- Students who like to play music = 2 * (students who like to play basketball) = 2 * 5 = 10

To find the total number of students who like to either play video games or play music, we subtract the students who like to bake and play basketball from the total number of students.

Students who like to play video games or music = Total students - (students who like to bake + students who like to play basketball)
= 50 - (10 + 5)
= 50 - 15
= 35

Since we know that students who like to play music = 10, students who like to play video games = students who like to play video games or music - students who like to play music
= 35 - 10
= 25

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the number of birds that were scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of the initial number of birds, which is 12.

$$\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = \frac{12}{3} = 4$$

So, 4 birds were scared away. 

Now, we subtract 4 from the initial number of birds: 
$$12 - 4 = 8$$

Then, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. 
$$8 + 20 = 28$$

The final number of birds in the backyard is 28."
"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to determine the total number of students in each class. Since the two classes have a total of 80 students and each class has an equal number of students, we can divide 80 by 2 to find the number of students in each class.

80 ÷ 2 = 40 students per class

Next, we are given that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can multiply the number of students in each class by 40% (or 0.4):

40 × 0.4 = 16 girls per class

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

40 - 16 = 24 boys per class

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class.

"To determine the number of cake slices remaining on the plate, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step, adhering to the order of operations.

Initially, Mara had 2 slices on the plate. She then added 3 slices, resulting in 2 + 3 = 5 slices.

Next, she tripled the number of slices, which can be expressed as 5 × 3 = 15 slices.

However, we must note that the multiplication operation should be performed after the addition, as per the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). Therefore, the correct sequence is:

2 + 3 = 5
5 × 3 = 15

Now, Mara ate 2 slices, leaving her with 15 - 2 = 13 slices.

Finally, her friend stole 5 slices, resulting in 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

Therefore, the number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8.

"To determine the cost savings of choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference.

Let's denote the number of adults as A and the number of children as C. In this case, A = 2 and C = 2.

The cost for adults at the first amusement park is $26A, and the cost for children is $12C. Therefore, the total cost for the first amusement park is $26A + $12C.

Substituting the given values, we get:
$26(2) + $12(2) = $52 + $24 = $76

The cost for adults at the second amusement park is $14A, and the cost for children is $10C. Therefore, the total cost for the second amusement park is $14A + $10C.

Substituting the given values, we get:
$14(2) + $10(2) = $28 + $20 = $48

Now, let's find the difference in cost between the two amusement parks:
$76 (first amusement park) - $48 (second amusement park) = $28

Daily savings = 250 - 200
Daily savings = 50

Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7
Weekly savings = 50 * 7
Weekly savings = 350

The weekly savings of the tomato vendor is $350."
"Given the problem, we can establish a relationship between the number of marbles each person has. Let's denote the number of marbles Sean has as S, the number of marbles Carl has as C, and the number of marbles Cal has as Ca.

We are given that Sean has 56 marbles, so S = 56.

We also know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, which can be expressed as S = (1/2)Ca. Substituting the value of S, we get 56 = (1/2)Ca. Multiplying both sides by 2, we find Ca = 112.

Furthermore, we are told that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, which can be written as C = 4S. Substituting the value of S, we get C = 4(56) = 224.

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together: C + Ca = 224 + 112.

"To determine the number of additional groups needed, we first calculate the number of students per group by dividing the total number of students by the initial number of groups.

Total students = 54
Initial number of groups = 6

Students per group = Total students / Initial number of groups
Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

Now, we are informed that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students required, we multiply the new number of groups by the students per group.

Total students required = New number of groups * Students per group
Total students required = 12 * 9
Total students required = 108

Since we already have 54 students, we need to find the number of additional students required to form 12 groups.

Additional students required = Total students required - Total students available
Additional students required = 108 - 54
Additional students required = 54

To find the number of additional groups required, we divide the additional students required by the students per group.

Additional groups required = Additional students required / Students per group
Additional groups required = 54 / 9
Additional groups required = 6

"To determine the number of bananas Gunther had at the end, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

When Arnold stole half of the bananas, we can express this as a fraction: 48 / 2 = 24. This is a simple division operation, where we divide the initial number of bananas by 2.

Next, Gunther added 25 bananas to the pile, so we add 25 to the remaining 24 bananas: 24 + 25 = 49.

However, Arnold stole 12 bananas from the pile, so we subtract 12 from 49: 49 - 12 = 37.

Finally, Gunther added 6 bananas to the pile, so we add 6 to 37: 37 + 6 = 43.

Therefore, the final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43}$"

"To solve this problem, we need to apply the principles of ratio and proportion. Let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. We can represent the value of small and large stickers in terms of small buttons as follows:

Let's denote the value of a small sticker as S and the value of a large sticker as L. We know that:

1 large sticker = 3 small stickers (L = 3S)
1 small sticker = 1 small button (S = 1B)
1 large sticker = 3 small buttons (L = 3B)

We can express the value of large stickers in terms of small buttons as L = 3B.

Now, let's analyze the trades:

1. Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
   She starts with 30 small stickers, so she trades 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   The value of these small stickers in terms of small buttons is 27B.
   Since each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 27B / 3 = 9 large buttons from trading small stickers.

2. Now, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left. 
   She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
   She starts with 40 large stickers, so she trades 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   The value of these large stickers in terms of small buttons is 20 * 3B = 60B.
   Since each large button is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 60B / 3 = 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

3. Now, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
   She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. 
   The value of these large stickers in terms of small buttons is 20 * 3B = 60B.
   Since each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 60B / 3 = 20 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine has:

She has 9 large buttons, 20 large buttons, and 20 small buttons. 
The total number of buttons is 9 + 20 + 20 = 49.

The final answer is: 49"

Therefore, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is 7."
"Given that the council vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, and there are 33 people on the council, we can represent the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Consequently, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x.

To find the value of x, we can set up the equation based on the total number of votes:

x + 2x = 33

Combining like terms, we get:

3x = 33

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 33/3
x = 11

Since x represents the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x:

2x = 2(11)
= 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"

- Large: 18 / 2 = 9 students
- Extra-large: 9 + 6 = 15 students

Now, let's add the number of students for each size together:
11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

The total number of shirts ordered is 75."
"To calculate the final price after a 5% discount on an item marked at $140, we need to apply the discount to the original price. 

The discount amount is calculated as a percentage of the original price, which is 5% of $140. 

Discount = 0.05 * $140
Discount = $7

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the final price.

Final price = Original price - Discount
Final price = $140 - $7
Final price = $133

The final answer is: $133"
"To determine the total duration of the 20 playlists, we need to calculate the total number of hours of music they contain. 

First, we multiply the number of songs in each playlist by the number of playlists to find the total number of songs:
300 songs/playlist * 20 playlists = 6000 songs

Next, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song in hours to find the total duration:
6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60000 hours

Therefore, the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is 60000."
"To determine the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we need to break down the information provided.

First, we know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. This can be calculated as follows:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 people

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, the remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40.

60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. This can be calculated as follows:

60% of 40 = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #12 will win. This is simply the remaining people after subtracting those who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win:

40 - 24 = 16 people

Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to apply the concept of proportions and ratios. Let's break it down step by step.

Given that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can find the total number of Pomeranians by multiplying the number of girls by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up a proportion:

2/3 (Pomeranians) = 18 (Pomeranians)
x/1 (Total Puppies) = 18/2/3 (Pomeranians/Total Puppies)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

x = 18 * (3/2)
x = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies.

The final answer is: 27"
"To determine the amount Jayden needs to buy the camera, we must first calculate the total amount of money he has after receiving the allowance from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister, Ava, gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. Therefore, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find the amount Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"Given the problem, we can denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x. Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can write the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"

"To determine the total number of fruits George has, we need to calculate the number of pears he has, given that he has 45% more pears than bananas.

First, let's find 45% of the number of bananas. To do this, we multiply the number of bananas by 0.45 (which is equivalent to 45% expressed as a decimal).

Number of bananas = 200
45% of bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we add the result to the number of bananas to find the total number of pears.

Number of pears = Number of bananas + 45% of bananas
= 200 + 90
= 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears.

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
= 200 + 290
= 490

The final answer is: 490"
"To determine the number of candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to perform a simple subtraction and division operation.

First, we subtract the cost of the ball from the initial amount of money Marissa had: $80 - $20 = $60.

"To determine the cost of making 4 liters of juice, we need to calculate the total amount of oranges required and their total cost.

First, we establish the ratio of oranges to liters of juice: 5 kilograms of oranges per 1 liter of juice. To make 4 liters of juice, we multiply this ratio by 4, resulting in 5 * 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the oranges. Given that each kilogram of oranges costs $3, we multiply the total kilograms of oranges by the cost per kilogram: 20 * 3 = $60.

Therefore, the total cost for Sam to make 4 liters of juice is $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we first need to establish the number of books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can express this relationship as:

Let A be the number of books Ahmed read. Then, 2A is the number of books Ezra read.

Given that Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the equation:

2A = 300

To solve for A, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

A = 300 / 2
A = 150

Now that we know Ahmed read 150 books, we can find the total number of books Ezra will read after deciding to read 150 more. This is given by:

Total books read by Ezra = 300 (initial books) + 150 (additional books)
Total books read by Ezra = 450

To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we add their individual totals:

Total books read by both = 150 (Ahmed's books) + 450 (Ezra's books)
Total books read by both = 600

The final answer is: 600"
"To determine Tanya's earnings, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

Let's start with Monday. Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she does not earn an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add the earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To determine the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Let's denote the number of vanilla scents sold as V and the number of fruity scents sold as F. We are given that V = 5 * 4 = 20 and F = 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold by subtracting F from V.

Difference = V - F

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Bennet wants to make a total of $135 from selling his eggplants and corn. He already makes $60 from selling 20 eggplants at $3 each. To find out how much he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the amount he already made from the total amount he wants to make:

$$135 - 60 = 75$$

This means he needs to make $75 from selling the 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25):

$$\frac{75}{25} = 3$$

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To determine the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we need to calculate the time she dedicates to this activity. 

First, let's calculate the total time available for her weekend activities: 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, totaling 12 hours.

Next, we'll subtract the time she spends reading, which is 3 hours, from the total time available to find the remaining time: 12 - 3 = 9 hours.

Now, we need to calculate the time she spends playing video games, which is 1/3 of the remaining time: 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

To find the time spent playing soccer, we subtract the time spent reading and playing video games from the total time available: 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer: (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer is 50%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of pencils Anthony kept, we need to perform a series of fraction-based calculations.

First, Anthony gave 1/2 of his 50 pencils to Brandon. This can be calculated as:

50 - (1/2 * 50) = 50 - 25 = 25

So, Anthony has 25 pencils left.

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find 3/5 of 25, we can multiply 25 by 3/5:

25 * (3/5) = (25 * 3) / 5 = 75 / 5 = 15

Now, we subtract the number of pencils given to Charlie from the remaining pencils:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a constant speed of 75 miles per hour. We can use the formula Time = Distance / Speed to find the time it takes to drive to the museum and back.

Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours
Time to drive back home = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Total time driving = Time to drive to the museum + Time to drive back home = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

Since Jack spends 6 hours at the museum, we can add this to the total time driving to find the total time he is gone from home.

Total time Jack is gone from home = Total time driving + Time at the museum = 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of wheels left after assembling the toys, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles, and then subtract this from the initial number of wheels in the box.

First, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 4 * 57 = 228 wheels.

Next, we calculate the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 2 * 73 = 146 wheels.

Now, we add the number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

To find the number of wheels left, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the initial number of wheels in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

The final answer is: $\boxed{276}$"
"To calculate the final price after a 20% discount on a laptop priced at $1000, we apply the formula for percentage discount:

Discount amount = Original price * (Discount percentage / 100)
Discount amount = $1000 * (20 / 100)
Discount amount = $1000 * 0.20
Discount amount = $200

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:

Final price = Original price - Discount amount
Final price = $1000 - $200
Final price = $800

Therefore, the final price after the 20% discount is $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, which can be calculated as follows:

$$\frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200$$

So, there are 200 movies in series. Since Mike can get these movies for $6 each, the cost of the movies in series is:

$$200 \times 6 = 1200$$

Next, we need to find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:

$$600 - 200 = 400$$

Now, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, which can be calculated as follows:

$$0.4 \times 400 = 160$$

The cost of the older movies is:

$$160 \times 5 = 800$$

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:

$$400 - 160 = 240$$

The cost of the normal movies is:

$$240 \times 10 = 2400$$

Now, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost:

$$1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400$$

The final answer is: $4400"
"To determine the total amount spent by Winston on the fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them together.

The cost of peaches is calculated as the product of the weight and the price per pound: 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00.

Similarly, the cost of plums is found by multiplying the weight and the price per pound: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00.

Lastly, the cost of apricots is obtained by multiplying the weight and the price per pound: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00.

To find the total cost, we add the individual costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we can break down the problem into two parts: the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

Let's denote the driving speed as $d_s = 50$ miles per hour. The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half of the driving speed, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{2}d_s - 5$. Substituting the value of $d_s$, we get $\frac{1}{2}(50) - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20$ miles per hour.

The time spent driving is given as 6 hours, and the time spent hiking is 1.5 hours. We can use the formula $d = rt$ to find the distance, where $d$ is the distance, $r$ is the rate (or speed), and $t$ is the time.

For the driving distance, we have $d_d = d_st_d = 50 \cdot 6 = 300$ miles.

For the hiking distance, we have $d_h = r_th = 20 \cdot 1.5 = 30$ miles.

To find the total distance to the vacation spot, we add the driving distance and the hiking distance: $d_{total} = d_d + d_h = 300 + 30 = 330$ miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{330}$"
"To determine the difference in the scores of Ava and Emma, we need to establish the relationship between their scores based on the given conditions.

Let's denote Emma's score as E and Ava's score as A. We know that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, collects 3 more berries than Emma, and finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

The score for each enemy jumped is 10 points, the score for each berry collected is 5 points, and the score for each second left on the timer is 30 points.

We can express Ava's score as A = (E + 8) * 10 + (E + 3) * 5 + (60 - (E + 4)) * 30.

Simplifying the expression, we get A = 10E + 80 + 5E + 15 + 30(56 - E).

Combine like terms to get A = 15E + 95 + 1680 - 30E.

Combine like terms again to get A = -15E + 1675.

Now, we can express the difference in their scores as A - E = (-15E + 1675) - E.

Combine like terms to get A - E = -16E + 1675.

However, we don't have enough information to determine the value of E. We can express the difference in their scores in terms of E, but we need to find the value of E to determine the actual difference.

Since we don't have any information about the value of E, we can analyze the given conditions to find a relationship between E and A.

We know that Ava's timer score is 30(56 - (E + 4)) = 30(52 - E) = 1560 - 30E.

We also know that Emma's timer score is 30(60 - E) = 1800 - 30E.

The difference in their timer scores is (1800 - 30E) - (1560 - 30E) = 240.

The difference in their enemy scores is 8.

The difference in their berry scores is 3.

The difference in their scores is the sum of the differences in their enemy scores, berry scores, and timer scores: 8 + 3 + 240 = 251.

The final answer is: $\boxed{251}$"
"Given that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars, and two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each, we can calculate the cost of the other two pizzas.

First, we determine the total cost of the two known pizzas: 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Next, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas: 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza: 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas costs 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. This can be represented as 3 × 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 × 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 × 2 = 12.

To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we add the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days: 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's analyze the problem. We have a system of linear equations representing the situation:

Let W be the number of white fish Bob bought and O be the number of orange fish Bob bought.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying W white fish and O orange fish, he had 3 + O orange fish and 4 + W white fish. Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + O = 2(4 + W)

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so W + O = 17.

We can solve the first equation for O:

O = 2(4 + W) - 3
O = 8 + 2W - 3
O = 5 + 2W

Now we can substitute this expression for O into the second equation:

W + 5 + 2W = 17

Combine like terms:

3W + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3W = 12

Divide both sides by 3:

W = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in a week and then convert it to gallons of fuel consumed.

The distance between Andy's home and office is 5 miles, and he travels this distance twice a day (to and from work), so the total daily distance is 2 * 5 miles = 10 miles.

Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

To convert miles to gallons, we use the fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon. We can set up a proportion to find the number of gallons consumed per week:

50 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons/week

Now, we can calculate the total cost per week by multiplying the gallons consumed by the price of gas:

5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week

Therefore, the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car is $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, we need to determine the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the quarters. Since Carrie was given 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, the total value of the quarters is 140 × $0.25 = $35.

Next, we need to find the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. To find 3/5 of 10, we multiply 10 by 3/5, which is equivalent to (3 × 10) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6. Therefore, she spent 6 twenties.

The value of the 6 twenties is 6 × $20 = $120.

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties to find the total amount of money she spent: $35 + $120 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"

"To determine the amount John is missing, we need to calculate the total cost of the trip and subtract the amount the school will cover, as well as the amount John has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school will cover half of this amount, we can calculate the school's contribution as:

School's contribution = Total cost / 2
= $300 / 2
= $150

Now, we need to find the amount John is missing. To do this, we subtract the school's contribution and John's contribution from the total cost:

Amount John is missing = Total cost - (School's contribution + John's contribution)

"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we must first calculate the temperature difference between the freezing point and the night temperature.

The freezing point of water is 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Given that the temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than the day, we can calculate the night temperature as follows:

Night temperature = Day temperature - 33
Night temperature = 45 - 33
Night temperature = 12 degrees Fahrenheit

Now, we can calculate the temperature difference between the freezing point and the night temperature:

Temperature difference = Freezing point - Night temperature
Temperature difference = 32 - 12
Temperature difference = 20 degrees Fahrenheit

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can determine the number of logs needed to prevent the pipes from freezing by dividing the temperature difference by the heat each log provides:

Number of logs = Temperature difference / Heat per log
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

"To determine the total number of seashells brought back by the groups, we first need to calculate the number of groups formed and then find the number of groups that brought back seashells.

Given that 90 people were required to split into groups, and each group consisted of 9 people, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Now, we need to find the number of groups that brought back seashells. It is given that 3/5 of the number of groups brought back seashells. To find this, we multiply the total number of groups by the fraction 3/5:

Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * (3/5)
= 10 * (3/5)
= 6

Next, we calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups. Each group that brought back seashells contributed 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells is:

Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group

"To determine Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours.

Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For 8 hours, she earns 8 \* $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. To find 150% of $20, we multiply $20 by 1.5 (since 150% is equivalent to 1.5). This gives us 1.5 \* $20 = $30 per hour. For 3 hours, she earns 3 \* $30 = $90.

Her total earnings for the day are $160 + $90 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the sum of the female, male, and lion cubs. 

First, we identify the number of female lions, which is given as 12. The number of male lions is half the number of female lions, so we can express this as 12 / 2 = 6. The number of lion cubs is given as 14.

Now, we can calculate the total number of lions by adding the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs: 12 + 6 + 14.

12 + 6 + 14 = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the amount of money Mike will have left over after purchasing the discounted jeans, we need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are on sale for 25% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (expressed as a decimal).

Discount = 0.25 * $40
Discount = $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the price after the discount:

Price after discount = Original price - Discount
Price after discount = $40 - $10
Price after discount = $30

To find the amount of money Mike will have left over after paying with a $50 bill, we subtract the price after the discount from the $50 bill:

Money left over = $50 - $30
Money left over = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to determine the total number of employees and the total salary for each month, then multiply it by 3.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees can be calculated using the arithmetic sequence formula:

Total employees = Initial employees + (Number of months * Number of new employees per month)
Total employees = 200 + (3 * 20)
Total employees = 200 + 60
Total employees = 260

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee:
Total salary per month = Number of employees * Salary per employee
Total salary per month = 260 * 4000
Total salary per month = 1,040,000

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
Total amount paid = Total salary per month * Number of months
Total amount paid = 1,040,000 * 3
Total amount paid = 3,120,000

The final answer is: $3,120,000"
"To determine the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the sum of the time it takes to sing each song. 

The time for ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds, and since they plan to sing it twice, we multiply this value by 2 to get the total time for both performances: 2 * 150 = 300 seconds.

The time for ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds.

Now, we add the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" and the time for ""Jingle Bells"" to find the total caroling time: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

The final answer is: 540"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total earnings of both Billy and Sally after working 20 hours.

Let's start by determining Billy's hourly wage at different stages of his employment. Initially, Billy was paid $10 per hour. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, let's calculate Billy's total earnings after working 20 hours at his final hourly wage of $11.50:

Total earnings = Hourly wage × Number of hours worked
= $11.50 × 20
= $230

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Now, let's calculate Sally's total earnings after working 20 hours at her hourly wage of $10.50:

Total earnings = Hourly wage × Number of hours worked
= $10.50 × 20
= $210

To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Sally's total earnings from Billy's total earnings:

Difference in earnings = Billy's total earnings - Sally's total earnings
= $230 - $210
= $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of each item and then find the difference.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 × $2 = $6.

The cost of 2 bagels is 2 × $1 = $2.

Now, to find the difference in cost, we subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find Nikita's score, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and add 11. 

Pierson's score is 278. Half of 278 is $\frac{278}{2} = 139$. 
Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita's score is $139 + 11 = 150$.

To find the total score, we add Pierson's score and Nikita's score: $278 + 150 = 428$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{428}$"
"To determine the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately and then sum the results.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students. We know that there are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. Therefore, the total number of students is:

1000 students = 40 classes × 25 students/class

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is also 1000.

Next, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers. We know that there are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class. Therefore, the total number of teachers is:

120 teachers = 40 classes × 3 teachers/class

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:

240 trees = 120 teachers × 2 trees/teacher

Now, we can find the total number of trees planted by adding the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers:

Total trees planted = 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers)
Total trees planted = 1240

The final answer is: $\boxed{1240}$"
"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to determine the total number of stuffed animals she currently has and then calculate 30% of that total.

The total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has is 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs.

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals.

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30%, so we will round to the nearest whole number that will make the percentage 30% or more.

To find the total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats, we can set up the equation: 

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3: 

14 + x = 100

"To determine the number of hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the target hours.

First, let's calculate the hours Kris played in 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and she plays for half an hour each day. This can be represented as:

14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the hours Kris played in 1 week. There are 7 days in a week, and she plays for 2 hours each day. This can be represented as:

7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours

Now, we add the hours played in 2 weeks and 1 week to find the total hours Kris has played:

7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

To find the number of hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours:

30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"When analyzing the problem of two cars traveling at different speeds on a highway, we can apply the concept of relative motion to determine the distance between them after a given time period.

Let's denote the initial position of the first car as point A and the initial position of the second car as point B. Since the second car passes the first car, we can assume that the first car is initially at point A and the second car is at point B.

The first car travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, and the second car travels at a constant speed of 70 miles per hour. We are interested in finding the distance between the two cars after 2 hours.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

Distance = Speed × Time

Since the first car travels at 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, the distance it covers is:

d1 = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

Similarly, the second car travels at 70 miles per hour for 2 hours, covering a distance of:

d2 = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

Now, we need to find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours. Since the second car is traveling faster than the first car, it will be ahead of the first car. The distance between them will be the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:

Distance between the two cars = d2 - d1 = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Therefore, the distance between the two cars after 2 hours is 20 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the ring, we need to consider the cost of the diamond, the cost of the gold, and the premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600, and the cost of the gold is $300. The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold. To calculate the premium, we multiply the total cost by the decimal equivalent of 30%, which is 0.3. Therefore, the premium is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

To find the total cost with the premium, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold: $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate of Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of fourth-graders, and the pass rate of fourth-graders is 40/100, the pass rate of fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80 out of 400.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed:
340 + 40 + 80 = 460

Next, let's find the total number of students:
500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: $\boxed{46}$"

Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips per bag
Total chips = 2 * 72
Total chips = 144 chips

Now, we can find the total number of square inches Milo can create with the glass chips:

Total square inches = Total chips / chips per square inch
Total square inches = 144 / 12
Total square inches = 12

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total square inches by the height:

Length = Total square inches / height
Length = 12 / 3
Length = 4

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the initial amount of tea at the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and then add it to the remaining tea.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students who drank 1.5 quarts each: 4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts.

Next, we calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students who drank 2 quarts each: 16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is the sum of these two quantities: 6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea consumed to gallons: 38 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 9.5 gallons.

Now, we add the remaining tea to the total amount consumed to find the initial amount of tea: 9.5 gallons (consumed) + 2.5 gallons (remaining) = 12 gallons.

However, we are given that there are 10 quarts of tea remaining, not 2.5 gallons. Let's correct this by converting the remaining tea to gallons: 10 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 2.5 gallons.

Now, we can recalculate the initial amount of tea: 9.5 gallons (consumed) + 2.5 gallons (remaining) = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Dale initially ordered 100 candies. Then, he sold 150 candies. However, since he sold more candies than he initially had, we need to consider the additional candies he ordered. He ordered 100 more candies, so the total number of candies he has is 100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200 candies.

Now, we subtract the number of candies he sold from the total number of candies he has: 200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50 candies.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"The problem at hand involves an exponential growth scenario, where the number of students doubles every month. This is a classic example of a geometric progression, where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed constant, in this case, 2.

Given that there are 10 students at the beginning of the year, we can model the growth as follows:

- January: 10 students (initial)
- February: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

To find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

160 - 10 = 150

This result is consistent with the expected exponential growth pattern. In general, the number of students at the end of May can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of a geometric progression:

an = a1 * r^(n-1)

where a1 is the initial term (10 students), r is the common ratio (2), and n is the number of terms (5, since we're considering the end of May).

Plugging in the values, we get:

a5 = 10 * 2^(5-1) = 10 * 2^4 = 10 * 16 = 160

Therefore, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to calculate the total number of branches he climbed and then divide that by the number of days he worked.

Let's start by dividing the total amount of money Felix made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = 105 / 0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by the number of days.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 × 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 × 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 × 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 × 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have, we need to calculate the remaining marshmallows after accounting for those used and dropped.

Let's start by calculating the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. 

Total marshmallows used by John = 9
Total marshmallows used by DeSean = 9
Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 + 3 = 21

Now, we subtract the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number of marshmallows in the bag to find the remaining marshmallows.

Total marshmallows in the bag = 35
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Since there are two kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to determine how many S'mores each kid can have.

S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total amount of money used at the arcade, we need to calculate the total time played by each person and then multiply it by the cost per minute.

First, let's convert the total time played from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 4 hours is equal to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time played by each person. Jack plays for 240 minutes. Two of his friends play for half the time, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each. The friend who is better than Jack plays for 1.5 times the time, so they play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes.

The total time played is the sum of the time played by each person: 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is 1 / 20 = $0.05.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money used: 840 minutes * $0.05/minute = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"Given the problem, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the ingredients and their quantities. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x, the amount of salt (and sugar) as 2x, and the amount of oil as 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:

x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10

Combine like terms:

8x = 10

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 10/8

x = 1.25

Now, we can find the amount of oil by substituting the value of x into the expression for the amount of oil:

Oil = 4x
= 4(1.25)
= 5

Therefore, the amount of oil used is 5 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total amount spent by John, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats can be calculated as follows:

3 goats * $500 = 3 × 500 = $1500

The cost of the cows can be calculated as follows:

2 cows * $1500 = 2 × 1500 = $3000

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows to find the total amount spent:

$1500 + $3000 = $4500

Therefore, John spent a total of $4500."
"To determine the number of cupcakes Paul should purchase, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of cupcakes required and the number of cupcakes he already has.

Let's denote the total number of cupcakes needed as T = 63 and the number of cupcakes Paul already has as C = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48.

To find the number of cupcakes Paul should buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes needed:

T - C = 63 - 48

Using basic arithmetic operations, we can simplify this expression:

T - C = 15

Therefore, Paul should purchase 15 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step, applying algebraic and percentage concepts.

Given that Robert has 20 cars, and Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, we can express Joe's initial number of cars as 2x, where x = 20. Therefore, Joe has 2(20) = 40 cars.

Now, let's calculate the number of cars Joe sells, which is 20% of his total. This can be expressed as 0.2(40) = 8 cars.

Next, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2(8) = 16 cars.

To find the total number of cars Joe gives away, we add the number of cars he sold and the number he gave away: 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

Finally, to determine the number of cars Joe remains with, we subtract the total number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount each student raised, we first need to isolate the total amount contributed by the students. Given that the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the students' contribution can be calculated as follows:

Total amount raised by the charity = $175,000
Amount raised by organizations = $50,000
Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by the charity - Amount raised by organizations
= $175,000 - $50,000
= $125,000

Now, to find the amount each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

Amount raised by students = $125,000
Number of students = 20
Amount each student raised = Amount raised by students / Number of students
= $125,000 / 20
= $6,250

Therefore, each student raised $6,250."
"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to determine the time she walked on each day and then sum the results.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour.

8 hours = 8 × 60 minutes = 480 minutes

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day. This is equivalent to 8 hours / 2 = 4 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60.

4 hours = 4 × 60 minutes = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time from both days to find the total time.

Total time = 480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to determine the number of cars present in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we need to calculate his daily earnings first. We know that he completes 30 cycles of work per day, with each cycle consisting of 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20.

Daily earnings = Number of cycles per day × Number of tasks per cycle × Pay per task
Daily earnings = 30 × 5 × $1.20
Daily earnings = $180

Now, to find his weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by 7.

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings × 7
Weekly earnings = $180 × 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Sasha's points in the first game as S1 and Julie's points in the first game as J1. We know that Sasha scored 14 points in the first game, so S1 = 14.

We are also given that Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so J1 = S1 - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10.

Now, let's consider the second game. We are told that Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. Let's denote Sasha's points in the second game as S2. We can express S2 as J1 - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to add her points from both games: S1 + S2 = 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food purchased by Kimberly, we first calculate the total number of tins of each type. 

The number of tins of cat food is found by multiplying the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88.

Similarly, the number of tins of dog food is found by multiplying the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36.

Now, to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and add them together.

Let's start by identifying the number of green eggs: 5.

Since Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, we can express this as 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

Next, we know that Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so the number of pink eggs is 10 - 1 = 9.

Finally, the number of yellow eggs is one-third the number of pink eggs, which can be expressed as 9 / 3 = 3.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To determine the amount Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's calculate the cost of shipping:
The cost per pound is $0.35, and the weight of the book is 4 pounds. The cost per mile is $0.08, and the distance is 20 miles. We can calculate the total cost of shipping as follows:

Total cost of shipping = (Cost per pound * Weight) + (Cost per mile * Distance)
= (0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20)
= 1.4 + 1.6
= $2.99

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. The refund is 75% of the purchase price, which is $32. We can calculate the refund amount as follows:

Refund amount = Purchase price * Refund percentage
= 32 * 0.75
= $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
Total loss = Total cost of shipping + (Purchase price - Refund amount)
= 2.99 + (32 - 24)
= 2.99 + 8
= $10.99

The final answer is: $10.99"
"To determine the amount of money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract it from the total amount of money she had initially.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan had after her father gave her $100. This is simply the sum of the initial amount and the additional amount: $40 + $100 = $140.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money Mulan spent on the items she purchased. She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of the jeans is 2 × $30 = $60. Additionally, she bought a bag for $20. Therefore, the total amount of money she spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, we can find the amount of money Mulan has left by subtracting the total amount of money she spent from the total amount of money she had initially: $140 - $80 = $60.

"To determine the production for the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

Let's break down the production for each week:

- Week 1: 8,000 bars
- Week 2: 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars (since Boris produces half as much as the first week)
- Week 3: 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars (since Boris produces three times as much as the first week)

Now, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks:
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends per week and multiply it by 4.

First, let's break down the time Britany spends on TikTok-related activities per week:

1. Writing amateur songs: 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
2. Doing makeup: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes
3. Recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes per video = 72 minutes

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity: 120 minutes (songs) + 90 minutes (makeup) + 72 minutes (videos) = 282 minutes

To convert the total weekly time to hours, we divide by 60: 282 minutes / 60 = 4.7 hours

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4 to get the total time spent on TikTok in a month: 4.7 hours * 4 = 18.8 hours

"To determine the total cost of the installation, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts. The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures for a fixed cost of $129.00.

Angela has additional items that need to be installed: 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. We need to calculate the cost of these additional items. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, we can calculate the cost of the additional items as follows:

Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors, cost: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier, cost: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures, cost: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"To determine the amount of money Roy has saved, we need to calculate 40% more than Anthony's savings. 

First, let's establish the amount Anthony has saved, which is $10 more than Eva's savings. Eva has saved $20, so Anthony has saved $20 + $10 = $30.

To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30 by 0.4: $30 × 0.4 = $12.

Now, we add this 40% to Anthony's savings to find the total amount Roy has saved: $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to establish a hierarchical relationship between the individuals' lifting capabilities. 

Let's denote the height of a mountain that Pompei can lift as 'P'. Given that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, Saskay's lifting capacity is 12P. 

Kagiyami's lifting capacity is 4 times higher than Saskay's, so it is 4 * 12P = 48P.

Naruto's lifting capacity is 10 times higher than Kagiyami's, so it is 10 * 48P = 480P.

Since Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, we can substitute P = 1 into the expression for Naruto's lifting capacity: 480P = 480 * 1 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12: 480 / 12 = 40 feet.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours, and then add them together.

The formula for distance is Distance = Speed x Time. Given that Mason's speed is 8 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance covered in each segment of his journey.

Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, we can find the total distance by adding the two distances together: 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.

The final answer is: 80"
"When analyzing this problem, we need to consider the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles. Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can establish a proportion to find the time it takes for the turtles to travel across the highway.

Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as K and the speed of a turtle as T. We know that T = 0.5K. 

We are given that three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway. If we let x be the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway, then 3x = 18, which implies x = 6. 

Now, we need to find the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway. Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, it will take them twice as long to travel the same distance. Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway is 2 * 6 * 4 = 48 hours.

The final answer is: 48"
"Given the problem, we can represent the number of clay dishes made by each person using variables. Let's denote the number of dishes made by Kora as K, Rory as R, and Jada as J.

We are given that Kora made 20 dishes, so K = 20. We also know that Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, which can be expressed as R = K + 20. Substituting the value of K, we get R = 20 + 20 = 40.

Furthermore, Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so J = 2R. Substituting the value of R, we get J = 2(40) = 80.

To find the total number of dishes they made together, we add the number of dishes each person made: K + R + J = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140.

"To determine the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's help.

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has been paid $150 and her mom gave her $80, so the total amount of money she received is: $150 + $80 = $230.

Now, we know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so the total amount of money she has is the price of the laptop after trading in her old one plus the extra money she needs: $400 + $50 = $450.

Since Erika received $230, the amount of money she had in her purse initially is: $450 - $230 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"

First, let's find the total number of slices from the large and small apples. 

The number of slices from 3 large apples is 3 × 5 = 15.
The number of slices from 5 small apples is 5 × 3 = 15.

Now, we add the number of slices from the large and small apples: 15 + 15 = 30.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of cows needed to produce 25 liters of milk per day, we first need to establish the milk production rate per cow. Given that each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we can calculate the required number of cows as follows:

Let x be the number of cows needed to produce 25 liters of milk per day. We can set up the equation:

5x = 25

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 25 / 5
x = 5

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find the difference between the required number of cows and the number of cows he already has:

Number of cows needed = 5 - 3
Number of cows needed = 2

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which is 1/6 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/6, which is equivalent to 12 × (1/6) = 12/6 = 2 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which is 2/3 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 2/3, which is equivalent to 12 × (2/3) = 24/3 = 8 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which is 1/2 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/2, which is equivalent to 12 × (1/2) = 12/2 = 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the unused portions together: 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

"To determine the amount of money Gabriel still needs, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to acquire. The car costs $10000 and the phone costs $800, so the total cost is $10000 + $800 = $10800.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently possesses. He has $5000 from his weekend work and an additional $200 from his brother, resulting in a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

Now, to find the amount of money Gabriel still needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost of the items: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"To determine the change Thea received, we need to calculate the difference between the amount she gave the craftsman and the cost of the hat.

The amount Thea gave the craftsman is $80, which is the product of 4 and $20. This can be expressed as:

4 × $20 = $80

Now, we subtract the cost of the hat, $70, from the total amount given:

$80 - $70 = $10

Therefore, Thea received $10 as change."
"To determine the amount of money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

Craig has 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 × $20 = $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of squirt guns is 6 × $2 = $12.

He buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of water balloons is 3 × $3 = $9.

The total amount he spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's denote the number of socks Jack collected as S and the number of dishes Jack collected as D. We are given the following information:

1. D = 60 (Jack collected 60 dishes)
2. S = D / 2 (Jack collected twice as many socks as dishes)
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter's socks = 2S
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter's dishes = D / 2

Now, let's express the number of socks and dishes Peter has in terms of S and D:
Peter's socks = 2S
Peter's dishes = D / 2

We can substitute the value of D from equation 1 into the expression for Peter's dishes:
Peter's dishes = 60 / 2
Peter's dishes = 30

Now, let's find the value of S using equation 2:
S = D / 2
S = 60 / 2
S = 30

Now that we have the value of S, we can find the number of socks Peter has:
Peter's socks = 2S
Peter's socks = 2 * 30
Peter's socks = 60

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = S + 2S = 3S
Total socks = 3 * 30
Total socks = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = D + D / 2
Total dishes = 60 + 30
Total dishes = 90

Total number of socks and dishes together = Total socks + Total dishes
Total number of socks and dishes together = 90 + 90
Total number of socks and dishes together = 180"
"Given a set of students in Miss Susan's class, we can apply the principles of set theory to determine the number of students good at math. Let's denote the set of students good at math as M, the set of students good at English as E, and the total number of students as S.

We know that the total number of students is 20, so |S| = 20. We also know that the number of students good at math only is 5, which can be represented as |M ∩ E'| = 5, where E' is the complement of set E (i.e., students not good at English). Similarly, the number of students good at English only is 8, which can be represented as |E ∩ M'| = 8, where M' is the complement of set M (i.e., students not good at math).

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can express the total number of students as:

|S| = |M ∪ E| = |M| + |E| - |M ∩ E|

We are given that |M ∩ E'| = 5 and |E ∩ M'| = 8. Since |M ∩ E'| + |E ∩ M'| = |M'| + |E'|, we can find the number of students not good at either math or English as:

|M'| + |E'| = 5 + 8
|M'| + |E'| = 13

Now, we can express the total number of students as:

|S| = |M| + |E| - |M ∩ E|
20 = |M| + |E| - (|M'| + |E'|)

Substituting |M'| + |E'| = 13, we get:

20 = |M| + |E| - 13
|M| + |E| = 33

Since |M ∩ E| = |M| + |E| - |S|, we can substitute |M| + |E| = 33 and |S| = 20 to find:

|M ∩ E| = 33 - 20
|M ∩ E| = 13

However, we are interested in finding the number of students good at math, which is |M|. We know that |M ∩ E| = 13, and |M ∩ E'| = 5. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can express |M| as:

|M| = |M ∩ E| + |M ∩ E'|
|M| = 13 + 5
|M| = 18

However, this is incorrect. We need to consider that |M ∩ E| is the number of students good at both math and English, and |M ∩ E'| is the number of students good at math only. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

|M| = |M ∩ E'| + |M ∩ E|
|M| = 5 + 7
|M| = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and then divide it by the time each group takes to perform, including getting on and off the stage.

Each group requires 10 minutes for setup, performance, and teardown. The total concert duration is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. However, we must subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total concert duration to find the available time for performances: 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the number of groups that can perform within the available time: 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to consider the simple interest formula: A = P(1 + rt), where A is the amount, P is the principal (initial investment), r is the interest rate, and t is the time period.

However, in this case, the interest rate is given as a percentage of the principal, which is 0.75. This can be expressed as a decimal: 0.75. The interest earned each year is 0.75 times the principal, which is $300. Therefore, the interest earned each year is $225.

The total amount after 1 year is the principal plus the interest earned: $300 + $225 = $525.
The total amount after 2 years is the previous total plus the interest earned: $525 + $225 = $750.
The total amount after 3 years is the previous total plus the interest earned: $750 + $225 = $975.

Alternatively, we can use the formula A = P(1 + rt) to calculate the total amount after 3 years, where r = 0.75 and t = 3. However, since the interest rate is a percentage of the principal, we need to express it as a decimal and multiply it by the principal to get the interest earned each year.

The final answer is: $975"
"To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we need to determine the number of white shirts with collars and subtract it from the total number of white shirts. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with collars is $\frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20$.

The number of white shirts with no collars is $40 - 20 = 20$.

To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we need to determine the number of floral shirts with buttons and subtract it from the total number of floral shirts. The number of floral shirts with buttons is given as 20.

The number of floral shirts with no buttons is $50 - 20 = 30$.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

The difference is $30 - 20 = 10$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the farmer's earnings, we need to calculate the number of trays and then multiply it by the price per tray. 

First, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray:

$$\frac{900}{30} = 30$$

This means the farmer has 30 trays. Now, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

$$30 \times 2.5 = 75$$

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the number of goats left in the two farms, we need to calculate the number of goats sold from each farm and then subtract that from the initial number of goats in each farm.

Let's start with Farm X. Mr. Smith initially had 55 goats and sold 10. The number of goats left in Farm X can be calculated as follows:

55 - 10 = 45

Now, let's move on to Farm Y. Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y.

The initial number of goats in Farm Y was 45. To find the number of goats left in Farm Y, we subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number:

45 - 20 = 25

Now that we have the number of goats left in each farm, we can find the total number of goats left by adding the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:

45 + 25 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to calculate the total expenditure on shoes per year and divide it by the number of pairs purchased annually.

Given that James spends $2640 on shoes each year and buys 2 pairs of shoes per month, we can calculate the total number of pairs purchased per year as follows:

Number of pairs per year = 2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Now, we can calculate the average cost per pair by dividing the total expenditure by the number of pairs:

Average cost per pair = Total expenditure per year / Number of pairs per year
= $2640 / 24
= $110

Therefore, the average cost per pair of shoes is $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To determine the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, we need to calculate the cost of each type of basket and then apply the discount for the red food.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is calculated as follows: 3 × $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is calculated as follows: 3 × $18 = $54.

The total cost before applying the discount is the sum of the costs of the green and red food baskets: $75 + $54 = $129.

Since a discount of $2 is applied to each basket of red food, the total discount is 3 × $2 = $6.

To find the total cost after the discount, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount: $129 - $6 = $123.

Therefore, the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, with a discount of $2 for each basket of red food, is $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To determine the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms and we want to clean one-half of them, we can express this as a fraction:

90 rooms / 2 = 45 rooms

Now, we need to find the total time it takes to clean 45 rooms. It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so we can multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

45 rooms × 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

900 minutes ÷ 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 × 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, they will double this amount, so 2 × 48 = 96 homes.

Now, we add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

The final answer is: 144"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote my age as x, my brother's age as x + 3, my sister's age as x - 2, and my mom's age as 3(x + 3) - 1.

We know that the sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x + 8 - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 8x + 17 = 87.

Subtract 17 from both sides: 8x = 70.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 8.75.

However, since age cannot be a decimal, we need to re-examine the equation. Let's try to find a whole number solution.

We can rewrite the equation as: 8x = 70.

Since 8x is a multiple of 8, we can try to find a whole number solution by dividing 70 by 8. However, 70 is not a multiple of 8, so we need to find the closest multiple of 8 that is less than or equal to 70.

The closest multiple of 8 that is less than or equal to 70 is 64. However, 64 is not equal to 70, so we need to find the next multiple of 8.

The next multiple of 8 is 72, but that is greater than 70. Therefore, we need to find a whole number solution that is less than 8.75.

Let's try x = 8. However, this is not a solution since 8 + 3 + 6 + 24 - 1 = 40, which is not equal to 87.

Let's try x = 9. However, this is not a solution since 9 + 12 + 7 + 30 - 1 = 57, which is not equal to 87.

Let's try x = 10. However, this is not a solution since 10 + 13 + 8 + 33 - 1 = 63, which is not equal to 87.

Let's try x = 11. However, this is not a solution since 11 + 14 + 9 + 36 - 1 = 69, which is not equal to 87.

Let's try x = 12. However, this is not a solution since 12 + 15 + 10 + 39 - 1 = 75, which is not equal to 87.

Let's try x = 13. However, this is not a solution since 13 + 16 + 11 + 42 - 1 = 81, which is not equal to 87.

Let's try x = 14. However, this is not a solution since 14 + 17 + 12 + 45 - 1 = 87, which is equal to 87.

Therefore, the correct answer is x = 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of glue sticks required for his students.

Let's denote the number of students as S, the number of glue sticks per student as G, and the number of glue sticks per pack as P. We are given that S = 27, G = 2, and P = 8.

The total number of glue sticks required is the product of the number of students and the number of glue sticks per student: S × G = 27 × 2 = 54.

To find the number of packs required, we divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack: 54 ÷ 8 = 6.75.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we must round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we need to round 6.75 up to 7.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to consider the changes in water volume over the three days.

Let's denote the initial amount of water as W1 = 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water doubles, so the new volume is W2 = 2 * W1 = 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water increases by 6000 gallons, so the new volume is W3 = W2 + 6000 = 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we add the volumes of water for all three days: W_total = W1 + W2 + W3 = 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"The scenario you've presented is a classic example of exponential growth, where the number of infected individuals increases at an accelerating rate. This type of growth is often modeled using the exponential function, which can be represented as:

N(t) = N0 \* (1 + r)^t

where N(t) is the number of infected individuals at time t, N0 is the initial number of infected individuals, r is the growth rate, and t is the time period.

In this case, we have N0 = 10 (initially infected individuals), r = 6/10 = 0.6 (growth rate, since each infected person infects 6 others), and t = 3 (time period in days).

To find the total number of people infected after three days, we can plug these values into the exponential growth function:

N(3) = 10 \* (1 + 0.6)^3
N(3) = 10 \* (1.6)^3
N(3) = 10 \* 4.096
N(3) = 40.96

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a person, we round up to the nearest whole number to account for the fact that all individuals are people. Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is approximately 41.

The final answer is: $\boxed{41}$"
"To determine the total amount of money received by Julieta and Rafaela as tips, we first need to calculate the individual amounts they received.

Rafaela received tips from 40 customers, each giving $20. Therefore, her total tips can be calculated as follows:

Rafaela's tips = 40 * $20 = $800

Since Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, we can find her total tips by subtracting 10% of Rafaela's tips from Rafaela's total tips:

Julieta's tips = Rafaela's tips - (10% of Rafaela's tips)
= $800 - (0.1 * $800)
= $800 - $80
= $720

Now, to find the total amount of money they received as tips, we add their individual amounts:

Total tips = Rafaela's tips + Julieta's tips
= $800 + $720
= $1520

The final answer is: $1520"
"To determine the number of oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. 

Let's denote the number of oranges given to her daughters as 2x, where x is the number of daughters. Since she has 3 daughters, 2x = 2 * 3 = 6 oranges. 

Her only son received 3 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, we subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges: 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relative rates at which Claire, Amber, and Wendy earn Girl Scout badges. Let's denote the time it takes Claire to earn a badge as 't'. Since Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge, the time it takes Amber to earn a badge is 2t. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so the time it takes Wendy to earn a badge is t/3.

The number of badges earned by each person in a 1-year time frame (12 months) can be calculated as follows:

- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: (1/2) badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total amount raised by Paige, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold, and then multiply that by the price per slice.

First, we calculate the total number of slices baked. Since Paige bakes 2 loaves per hour and she worked for 5 hours, we can multiply the number of loaves per hour by the number of hours worked:

2 loaves/hour × 5 hours = 10 loaves

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so we multiply the total number of loaves by the number of slices per loaf:

10 loaves × 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices

Next, we need to convert the price per slice from cents to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can divide the price per slice by 100:

50 cents/slice ÷ 100 = $0.50/slice

Now, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice to get the total amount raised:

80 slices × $0.50/slice = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30 and G = 70.

Since G = S + 30 and G = 70, we can set up the equation S + 30 = 70.

To find S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:

S + 30 - 30 = 70 - 30
S = 40

Now that we know S = 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins:

Total coins = S + G
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos, we need to calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students and Mr. George.

First, we calculate the total number of burritos eaten by the students. There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. This can be represented as:

Total burritos eaten by students = Number of students * Number of burritos per student
= 50 * 10
= 500

Next, we need to account for the burritos eaten by Mr. George. It is given that he ate 20 burritos.

Total burritos eaten = Total burritos eaten by students + Burritos eaten by Mr. George
= 500 + 20
= 520

Now, we can find the total number of leftover burritos by subtracting the total number of burritos eaten from the initial number of burritos ordered:

Total leftover burritos = Initial number of burritos - Total burritos eaten
= 600 - 520
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's denote the number of red cars as R, the number of green cars as G, the number of blue cars as B, and the number of yellow cars as Y. We are given the following information:

1. R = 12 (number of red cars)
2. G = R - 2 (number of green cars)
3. B = 3G (number of blue cars)
4. R + G + B + Y = 75 (total number of cars)

Substituting the expressions for G and B from equations 2 and 3 into equation 4, we get:

R + (R - 2) + 3(R - 2) + Y = 75

Combine like terms:

R + R - 2 + 3R - 6 + Y = 75

Combine like terms:

5R - 8 + Y = 75

Add 8 to both sides:

5R + Y = 83

Subtract 5R from both sides:

Y = 83 - 5R

Substitute R = 12 into the equation:

Y = 83 - 5(12)

Y = 83 - 60

Y = 23

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of books Sofie, Anne, and Fawn possess.

Let F denote the number of books Fawn has, A denote the number of books Anne has, and S denote the number of books Sofie has.

We are given the following equations:

1. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
2. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)
3. S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)

We can substitute equation (1) into equation (3) to get:
(A + 25) + A + F = 85

Combine like terms:
2A + F + 25 = 85

Subtract 25 from both sides:
2A + F = 60

Now, substitute equation (2) into the above equation:
2(F - 12) + F = 60

Expand and combine like terms:
2F - 24 + F = 60

Combine like terms:
3F - 24 = 60

Add 24 to both sides:
3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
F = 28

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To determine the weight of the carrots, we need to calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes first. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Sweet Potatoes = 2 * Potatoes
Sweet Potatoes = 2 * 5
Sweet Potatoes = 10 pounds

Now, we know the sweet potatoes weigh 10 pounds. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so we can express this relationship as an equation:

Carrots = Sweet Potatoes - 3
Carrots = 10 - 3
Carrots = 7 pounds

Therefore, the weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To determine the total cost of Jello for Greg's party, we need to calculate the number of boxes required and then multiply it by the cost per box.

First, let's find the total number of Jello cups needed. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 Jello cups, the total number of Jello cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since one box of Jello makes 10 Jello cups, the number of boxes needed is 120 / 10 = 12.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. The cost of one box of Jello is $1.25. Therefore, the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the change the seller will receive, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones and subtract it from the amount given. 

The cost of each phone is $700, and the seller purchased 5 phones. The total cost is calculated as follows:

Total Cost = Number of Phones * Cost per Phone
Total Cost = 5 * $700
Total Cost = $3500

Now, we need to find the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount given:

Change = Amount Given - Total Cost
Change = $4000 - $3500
Change = $500

Therefore, the seller will receive $500 in change."
"To determine the amount Keenan spends per week, we first need to calculate his monthly expenditure. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

The total monthly expenditure is $400. To find 40% of this amount, we multiply $400 by 0.4.

$400 × 0.4 = $160

This is the amount Keenan spends in a month. To find out how much he spends per week, we divide this amount by the number of weeks in a month, which is 4.

$160 ÷ 4 = $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he consumed on each day and sum them up.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. To do this, we'll calculate 2/5 of the total 60 pieces.
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know he ate 10 pieces on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the number of pieces he ate on the third day. We need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
\[ 60 - 24 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces left} \]

To find out how many pieces he ate on the third day, we'll calculate 7/13 of the remaining pieces.
\[ \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = \frac{7 \times 26}{13} = \frac{182}{13} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate on each day: 
\[ 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \]

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we need to establish the unit prices of each item. 

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of soda is calculated as follows:

$$\frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00$$

Therefore, the unit price of 1 bottle of soda is $3.00.

Similarly, the cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of water is calculated as follows:

$$\frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00$$

Thus, the unit price of 1 bottle of water is $2.00.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:

$$3 \times 3.00 = 9.00$$
$$2 \times 2.00 = 4.00$$

The total cost is the sum of the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:

$$9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00$$

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To determine the amount of money David has left after purchasing the bolts, we need to perform a simple subtraction operation.

First, let's identify the initial amount of money David has: $12.48. This is the minuend.

Next, we need to find the cost of the bolts. Since each bolt costs $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the cost per bolt by the number of bolts:

16 \* $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after purchasing the bolts.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine Ella's earnings after 12 hours of dog walking at the same rate, we need to calculate her hourly wage. This can be done by dividing the total amount earned ($33) by the number of hours worked (3).

Ella's hourly wage = $33 ÷ 3 hours = $11 per hour.

Now, we can calculate her earnings after 12 hours by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours worked.

"To determine the number of marbles Paul has left, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after receiving the gift from his friend. This is done by adding the initial number of marbles (52) to the number of marbles received (28), which gives us 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Next, we need to find 1/4 of the total marbles Paul has after receiving the gift. To do this, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is equivalent to dividing 80 by 4. This gives us 80 ÷ 4 = 20 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles lost from the total marbles Paul had after receiving the gift: 80 - 20 = 60.

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she gets from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Since Amy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, we can find the number of correct answers by multiplying 10 by 0.8 (which is equivalent to 80%): 10 × 0.8 = 8. Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, the total points from multiple-choice questions is 8.

Next, we'll calculate the points from the true/false questions. Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions, so we can find the number of correct answers by multiplying 20 by 0.9 (which is equivalent to 90%): 20 × 0.9 = 18. Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, the total points from true/false questions is 18.

Now, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. Amy correctly answers 60% of the 5 long-answer questions, so we can find the number of correct answers by multiplying 5 by 0.6 (which is equivalent to 60%): 5 × 0.6 = 3. Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, the total points from long-answer questions is 3 × 5 = 15.

To find Amy's total score, we add the points from each type of question: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41.

The final answer is: $\boxed{41}$"
"To determine the cost price of the chickens, we first need to find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Now, we know that he plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each. To find the total revenue from selling the chickens, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, we are told that he needs to make a profit of $2000. This means the total amount he needs to make from selling the chickens is $9000 + $2000 = $11000.

Since he will make $9000 from selling the chickens, we can set up an equation to find the cost price:

Selling price = Cost price + Profit
$9000 = Cost price + $2000

To find the cost price, we subtract the profit from the selling price:

Cost price = $9000 - $2000
Cost price = $7000

Therefore, the cost price of the chickens is $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To determine the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah, we first need to find out how many glasses Micah sold. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses sold by 2.

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people selling glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Now, we can find the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

The final answer is: $\boxed{-2}$"
"To determine the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

Let's start by identifying the cost of the hair service, which is given as $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of the hair service. To find this, we can multiply the cost of the hair service by 1/4:

$$\frac{1}{4} \times 400 = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{400}{1} = \frac{400}{4} = 100$$

The cost of the manicure is $100.

Next, we need to find the cost of the pedicure, which is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure. To find this, we can multiply the cost of the manicure by 3/4:

$$\frac{3}{4} \times 100 = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{100}{1} = \frac{300}{4} = 75$$

The cost of the pedicure is $75.

Now, let's add the costs together to find the total amount Iris spent at the spa:

"To determine the amount of money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to calculate the profit from selling the original rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and Sarah sells it for $2 per meter. We can express this as a simple multiplication problem:

Revenue = Length × Price per meter
Revenue = 20 m × $2/m
Revenue = $40

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and Sarah wants to buy a rope that is also 20 meters long. We can express this as another multiplication problem:

Cost = Length × Price per meter
Cost = 20 m × $1.5/m
Cost = $30

Now, let's calculate the profit by subtracting the cost of the new rope from the revenue:

Profit = Revenue - Cost
Profit = $40 - $30
Profit = $10

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

The final answer is: $10"
"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic reasoning.

Let Melanie's current age be denoted by 'x'. According to the problem, in 10 years, she will be 18 years old. This can be represented as the equation x + 10 = 18.

Solving for x, we get x = 18 - 10 = 8. This implies that Melanie's current age is 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years 't' when her age will be thrice her present age. This can be represented as the equation x + t = 3x.

Substituting the value of x, we get 8 + t = 3(8).

Simplifying the equation, we get 8 + t = 24.

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get t = 16.

Therefore, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

Let's break down the costs:

- The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
- The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120, since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
- The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
- The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14, since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.

The total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart is $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

Since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly has overspent her budget by $91.

The amount of money Kelly has left in her budget is $0.

"To determine the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the runtime of her usual concert as x minutes.

The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so its runtime is 2x minutes. Additionally, the encore is 15 minutes long. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15 minutes.

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. This allows us to set up the equation 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation yields 2x = 65 - 15, which simplifies to 2x = 50.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x: x = 50 / 2, x = 25.

Therefore, the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage, we need to determine the total number of microphones that can be accommodated in pairs, given that 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in.

Let's denote the total number of microphones as M. Since 20% of the microphones won't be arranged, 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. This can be expressed as:

0.8M = 2x

where x is the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged.

Given that M = 50, we can substitute this value into the equation:

0.8(50) = 2x
40 = 2x
x = 40 / 2
x = 20

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To determine the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, let's consider the birds nesting in the bushes. We have a straightforward count of 6 birds.

Next, we need to calculate the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds nesting in the bushes are flying overhead, we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{2}{3} \cdot 6$. To find the product, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 6 and then divide by the denominator: $\frac{2 \cdot 6}{3} = \frac{12}{3} = 4$.

Now, let's consider the birds feeding. We have 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we can express this as a product: $3 \cdot 8 = 24$.

To find the total number of birds, we add the number of birds in each group: $6 + 4 + 24 = 34$.

"To determine the number of cookies in each jar, we need to perform a simple division operation. 

First, we calculate the total number of cookies remaining after Lani ate 5 cookies. This is done by subtracting the number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies:

Total cookies = 55
Cookies eaten = 5
Cookies left = Total cookies - Cookies eaten = 55 - 5 = 50

Next, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars to find the number of cookies in each jar:

Number of jars = 5
Cookies per jar = Cookies left / Number of jars = 50 / 5 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 cookies in each jar.

"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we need to calculate the number of flowering plants first.

Given that there are 100 plants in total, one-fourth of them are indoor plants. This can be calculated as 100 * (1/4) = 25 indoor plants.

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants, which can be calculated as 75 * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants.

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden is 25%.

"Given the problem, we can establish a relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, whatchamacallit, and thingamabob. Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as 't'. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, its speed can be expressed as 11t. We are also given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can set up the equation:

11t = 121

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we can solve for 't':

t = 121 / 11
t = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5t
Speed of whirligig = 5(11)
Speed of whirligig = 55

Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is 55 meters per second.

The final answer is: 55"

The total cost equation is: 2x + 6 + 3 = 11

Combine the constants: 2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2: x = 1

Therefore, the cost of one carrot is $1."
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the total number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's hourly wage was increased by $2, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, which is a total of 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's analyze the problem. We are given that Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We also know that she mowed Joe's lawn x times, Kamala's lawn 3x times, and Alba's lawn 5x times. The total number of lawns she mowed is x + 3x + 5x = 9x.

Since she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

We can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

To find the value of y, we can solve for x first. Since we know that 54x represents the total amount she made from mowing lawns, and we are given that she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, we can set up the equation 54x = 6 + 18x + 30x.

However, this equation is not necessary. We can simply subtract 6 from both sides of the equation 54x + y = 80 to isolate y. 

54x + y = 80
y = 80 - 54x

Since we are not given the value of x, we cannot find the exact value of y. However, we can express y in terms of x.

However, we can use the fact that she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn to find the value of x. We know that 6 = 6x, so x = 1.

Now we can substitute x = 1 into the equation y = 80 - 54x to find y.

y = 80 - 54(1)
y = 80 - 54
y = 26

The final answer is: $26"
"To determine Harry's weight, we need to calculate the weights of Carl and Christian first, as their weights are directly related to Martin's weight.

Martin's weight is given as 55 kg. 

Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so we add 16 to 55: 55 + 16 = 71 kg.

Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so we add 8 to 71: 71 + 8 = 79 kg.

Now, we need to find Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight. We subtract 5 from 79: 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

First, let's calculate his total earnings. We know he rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time and earns $25 per hour.

Total earnings = Number of rentals * Number of hours per rental * Hourly rate
Total earnings = 10 * 3 * $25
Total earnings = $750

Now, we need to subtract his car payment from the total earnings to find the profit.

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

"Let's denote the number of notebooks Martha had initially as M. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, the number of notebooks Joseph had can be expressed as 3M.

We are given that Martha bought 5 more notebooks and now has a total of 7 notebooks. This can be represented by the equation:

M + 5 = 7

To find the value of M, we can solve for M by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:

M = 7 - 5
M = 2

Now that we know Martha had 2 notebooks initially, we can find the number of notebooks Joseph had by multiplying M by 3:

Joseph's notebooks = 3M
= 3(2)
= 6

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of Joseph's notebooks from Martha's notebooks:

Martha's notebooks - Joseph's notebooks = 7 - 6
= 1

Therefore, Martha has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To calculate the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we need to determine the distance rowed by Anis. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can express this as a mathematical expression:

Let D represent the distance rowed by Dijana, which is given as 50 miles. The distance rowed by Anis can be expressed as D + (1/5)D.

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms:

D + (1/5)D = (6/5)D

Now, we can substitute the value of D (50 miles) into the expression:

(6/5)D = (6/5)(50) = 60 miles

So, Anis rowed 60 miles.

To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we add their individual distances:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
= 50 + 60
= 110 miles

The final answer is: 110"
"To determine the number of cookies each nephew will receive, we must first calculate the total number of cookies remaining after Susan's husband took some. 

The initial number of cookies is 100. After Susan's husband took 4 cookies, the remaining number of cookies is 100 - 4 = 96.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. This can be expressed as a division problem: 96 ÷ 6.

To solve this, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any two integers a and b, where b ≠ 0, there exist unique integers q and r such that a = bq + r, where 0 ≤ r < |b|.

In this case, we have a = 96 and b = 6. We can perform the division as follows:

96 ÷ 6 = 16

Therefore, each nephew will receive 16 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel, we need to calculate their total pages read.

Let's denote the number of pages Denise read yesterday as D_yesterday and the number of pages Daniel read yesterday as D_yesterday as well. We are given that D_yesterday = 10 for Denise and D_yesterday = 13 for Daniel.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which can be expressed as D_today = D_yesterday + 5. Substituting the value of D_yesterday for Daniel, we get D_today = 13 + 5 = 18.

Daniel did not read any pages today, so D_today = 0 for Daniel.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages read by Denise and Daniel. The total number of pages read by Denise is the sum of the pages she read yesterday and today, which is D_yesterday + D_today = 10 + 18 = 28.

The total number of pages read by Daniel is the number of pages he read yesterday, which is D_yesterday = 13.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is the difference between their total pages read, which is (D_yesterday + D_today) - D_yesterday = 28 - 13 = 15.

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the number of child's bowls that can be filled from the remaining soup.

Let's denote the number of child's bowls that can be filled from the pot as C. Since the pot can fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls, we can set up the following proportion:

4 adult's bowls = 8 child's bowls

We know that 4 adult's bowls were used for dinner, which is equivalent to 4 child's bowls. Therefore, the number of child's bowls used for dinner is 4.

The number of child's bowls left over is the total number of child's bowls that can be filled from the pot minus the number of child's bowls used for dinner:

C - 4 = number of child's bowls left over

We are given that the pot can fill 8 child's bowls. Therefore, C = 8.

Substituting C = 8 into the equation above, we get:

8 - 4 = 4

So, there are 4 child's bowls left over.

Since there are 2 children, and each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we can divide the number of child's bowls left over by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch:

4 ÷ 2 = 2

"To determine the total material needed for Jo's face masks, we need to calculate the material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the material needed for the small masks. We know that 2 yards of material can make 4 small masks. To find the material needed for one small mask, we divide the total material by the number of masks: 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards per mask. Now, we can multiply this by the number of small masks Jo wants to make: 20 small masks * 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards.

Next, we'll calculate the material needed for the large masks. We know that 2.25 yards of material can make 3 large masks. To find the material needed for one large mask, we divide the total material by the number of masks: 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards per mask. Now, we can multiply this by the number of large masks Jo wants to make: 8 large masks * 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards.

To find the total material needed, we add the material required for small and large masks: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to calculate the total number of tickets she purchased and divide the total amount she spent by that number.

Since Deepa saw each of the 9 movies three times, we can find the total number of tickets by multiplying the number of movies by the number of times she saw each movie: 9 movies * 3 showings/movie = 27 tickets.

Now, we can calculate the average price per ticket by dividing the total amount she spent ($216) by the total number of tickets (27):

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27

"To determine Harold's free time, we must first calculate the total hours in a day and then subtract the hours he spends on activities.

There are 24 hours in a standard day. 

Let's denote Harold's sleep time as S, work time as W, and dog-walking time as D. We are given that S = 10 hours, W = S - 2 = 8 hours, and D = 1 hour.

Total hours spent = S + W + D
Total hours spent = 10 + 8 + 1
Total hours spent = 19 hours

Now, we can calculate Harold's free time by subtracting the total hours spent from the total hours in a day.

Free time = Total hours in a day - Total hours spent
Free time = 24 - 19
Free time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of red shoeboxes used by Tim. Since he used 1/3 of his red shoeboxes, we can find this by dividing the total number of red shoeboxes by 3.

9 (total red shoeboxes) / 3 = 9 ÷ 3 = 3

So, Tim used 3 red shoeboxes. 

Now, let's calculate the number of blue shoeboxes used: 3 blue shoeboxes.

Initially, Tim had 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes. After using 3 blue and 3 red shoeboxes, he is left with:

Blue shoeboxes: 7 - 3 = 4
Red shoeboxes: 9 - 3 = 6

Therefore, the total number of shoeboxes left is 4 (blue) + 6 (red) = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the number of books Joseph currently has, we need to calculate the initial number of books he had and then subtract the number of books he lost.

Since Joseph had twice the number of books Sarah has, and Sarah has 9 books, we can express this relationship as:

Joseph's initial number of books = 2 * Sarah's number of books
= 2 * 9
= 18

Now, we need to subtract the number of books Joseph lost, which is 2.

Joseph's current number of books = Initial number of books - Number of books lost
= 18 - 2
= 16

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To determine the number of marbles Dean has left, we need to calculate the total number of marbles he gave away and subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's find 1/5 of 30, which is the fraction of marbles Dean gave to Jamie. This can be calculated as:

$$\frac{1}{5} \times 30 = \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{30}{1} = \frac{30}{5} = 6$$

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, he gave 10 marbles to Donald.

The total number of marbles Dean gave away is the sum of the marbles he gave to Jamie and Donald:

$$6 + 10 = 16$$

Now, we subtract the total number of marbles given away from the initial amount to find the number of marbles Dean has left:

$$30 - 16 = 14$$

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Let's analyze the given problem using algebraic equations.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
(60 - 8) = 2x
52 = 2x

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

52 = 2x
x = 52/2
x = 26

Now that we have Adam's age four years ago, we can find his current age by adding 4 to x:

Adam's current age = x + 4
Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = Adam's current age + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

The final answer is: $\boxed{38}$"
"To find the total acres of both farms, we need to calculate the acres of Farmer Smith's farm first. Since his farm is 100 acres more than twice the acres of Farmer Brown's farm, we can express this as an algebraic expression: 2x + 100, where x is the acres of Farmer Brown's farm.

Given that Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, we can substitute x = 200 into the expression to find the acres of Farmer Smith's farm: 2(200) + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we can find the total acres of both farms by adding the acres of Farmer Brown's farm and Farmer Smith's farm: 200 + 500 = 700 acres.

The final answer is: 700"
"To determine Colby's earnings in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Let's start by finding the number of packages Colby completes per hour. We know he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so we can express this as an algebraic expression: 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Now, we need to find the total number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday. We can do this by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works: 40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package, we can find his total earnings for the day by multiplying the total number of packages by his hourly wage: 320 packages * $0.20/package = $64.

Therefore, Colby's earnings in a typical eight-hour workday are $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To determine the number of bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve the puzzle and then divide it by the time interval at which he drinks a bottle.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes to solve. An extreme sudoku, being more complex, takes 4 times as long, which is 4 × 45 minutes = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes, we can calculate the number of bottles he drinks by dividing the total time by the time interval: 180 minutes ÷ 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"Given that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon, and the total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, we can set up the following equation to represent the situation:

2(20) + 3y = 58

where y is the number of yellow balloons.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

40 + 3y = 58

Subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation yields:

3y = 18

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

y = 6

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon's car requires, we need to calculate the total miles driven in 30 days. Given that he drives 100 miles per day, the total miles driven can be calculated as follows:

Total miles driven = 100 miles/day * 30 days
= 100 * 30
= 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can find the number of tune-ups required by dividing the total miles driven by 1000:

Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven / 1000
= 3000 / 1000
= 3

Therefore, Jon's car will require 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To determine the total hours Bruce works over the three days, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and then sum them up.

Let's start by identifying the hours worked on each day. On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours. 

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which can be expressed as 2 × 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which can be expressed as 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

The total hours Bruce works over the three days is 23."
"To determine the amount of allowance each girl received, we need to calculate the total amount spent and then divide it by 2.

The cost of the cake is $11. 

The cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, the number of 2-balloon sets is 12 / 2 = 6. So, the cost of 1 dozen balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2: $28 / 2 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To determine the total number of fruits Kira purchased, we need to calculate the sum of the individual quantities of each type of fruit. This can be expressed as:

Total Fruits = Apples + Bananas + Oranges
Total Fruits = 3 + 5 + 6

Using basic arithmetic operations, we can add these numbers together:

Total Fruits = 3 + 5 + 6
Total Fruits = 14

Now, we need to subtract the number of fruits Lola ate from the total number of fruits Kira purchased:

Remaining Fruits = Total Fruits - Fruits Eaten
Remaining Fruits = 14 - 2

Performing the subtraction:

Remaining Fruits = 14 - 2
Remaining Fruits = 12

Therefore, the number of fruits left is 12."
"To determine the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students participating in each sport and then sum them up.

First, let's consider the number of students playing tennis. We are given that there are 6 students playing tennis.

Next, we need to find the number of students playing volleyball. Since it's stated that there are twice as many students playing volleyball as there are playing tennis, we can express this as a simple multiplication: 2 * 6 = 12.

Now, let's calculate the number of students playing soccer. We are given that there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer. To find the total number of students playing soccer, we simply add the number of boys and girls: 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, we can find the total number of students by adding the number of students playing each sport: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To determine the profit made from selling lollipops, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

The total revenue is calculated by multiplying the number of students, the number of lollipops sold per student, and the price per lollipop. 

Total revenue = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Price per lollipop
Total revenue = 30 * 10 * $0.8
Total revenue = 300 * $0.8
Total revenue = $240

The total cost is calculated by multiplying the number of students, the number of lollipops sold per student, and the cost per lollipop.

Total cost = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Cost per lollipop
Total cost = 30 * 10 * $0.5
Total cost = 300 * $0.5
Total cost = $150

Now, we can calculate the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = $240 - $150
Total profit = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we need to break down the information provided and calculate the number of each type of pet.

Let's start with the number of cats, which is given as 3.

Since Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats, we can express this as a multiplication: 3 × 3 = 9 dogs.

Next, we're told he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so we subtract 2 from the number of dogs: 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

The number of fish in the tank is three times the number of rabbits, which can be expressed as 3 × 7 = 21 fish.

Now, we're informed that the number of gerbils is 1/3 the number of fish, so we divide the number of fish by 3: 21 ÷ 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The final answer is: 47"
"To determine the number of days a loaf of bread will last for Abby and Josh, we need to calculate their combined daily consumption. 

Abby eats 2 slices per day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, which is 2 * 2 = 4 slices per day. 

Their combined daily consumption is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

To find the number of days the loaf of bread will last, we divide the total number of slices by their combined daily consumption: 24 / 6 = 4.

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To determine the number of shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the total number of months she has been collecting shells. Since Martha collects one shell per month, we can simply multiply the number of years she has been collecting by the number of months in a year.

The number of years Martha has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years, since she started collecting at 5 years old.

The number of months in a year is 12.

Therefore, the total number of months Martha has been collecting shells is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is 60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, each row will have 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Let's denote the number of mint tea cups in each row as 'x'. Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of chamomile tea cups in each row will also be 'x'. 

The total number of mint tea cups is 15, and since there are 3 rows, the total number of mint tea cups is 3x. Therefore, we can set up the equation 3x = 15.

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

3x / 3 = 15 / 3
x = 5

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 5."
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to calculate the total number of trips he can make in 8 hours and then divide the total number of berries he wants to collect by the number of trips.

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips.

Now, we need to find the number of berries he can collect per trip. Let's denote the number of berries he picks up per trip as 'b'. Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he can make 2 trips, we can set up the equation:

2b = 24

To find the value of 'b', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

b = 24 / 2
b = 12

Therefore, the sloth can pick up 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we need to calculate the initial amount of water in the tank and then subtract the total amount of water used over the 6-day period.

The initial amount of water in the tank is half the amount of water in the pool, which is 10000 gallons. Therefore, the initial amount of water in the tank is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. To find the total amount of water used over 6 days, we multiply the daily rate by the number of days: 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons.

Now, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount to find the remaining water in the tank: 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To determine the number of movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget. 

Colby's monthly budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 \* $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 \* $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 \* $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 \* $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday. 

Now, let's calculate how much money is left for other days: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (round down to 1 since you can't see a fraction of a movie) more movie on other days.

Total movies Colby can see: 1 (on Friday) + 1 (on other days) = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate the total calories of the pastries, we need to determine the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini pastry has 1/3 of the calories of a normal version. We can express this as a fraction: 1/3 * 600 = 600/3. To simplify this, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. This gives us 200 calories for a mini cinnamon roll.

Now, let's find the calories of a mini blueberry muffin. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini pastry has 1/3 of the calories of a normal version. We can express this as a fraction: 1/3 * 450 = 450/3. To simplify this, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. This gives us 150 calories for a mini blueberry muffin.

Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories from both types of pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To calculate the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to find the total number of Junebugs she removed and divide it by the number of days.

Let's start by calculating the total number of Junebugs removed. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs per day. So, for Tuesday and Wednesday, the total is 78 + 78 = 156 Junebugs. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs, and on Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days = 300 / 5 = 60

The average number of Junebugs removed per day is 60."
"To determine the distance each vehicle traveled, we apply the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time. 

For the bus, traveling at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, the distance is calculated as 60 mph * 5 h = 300 miles.

For the car, traveling at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, the distance is calculated as 30 mph * 8 h = 240 miles.

To find the difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car, we subtract the car's distance from the bus's distance: 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.

"To determine the number of bouncy balls, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of toys after purchasing the bouncy balls and the total number of toys before the purchase.

Let's denote the number of blocks as B, the number of stuffed animals as A, the number of rings as R, and the number of bouncy balls as x. We are given the following information:

B = 31
A = 8
R = 9
Total number of toys after purchasing bouncy balls = B + A + R + x = 62

We can now solve for x by subtracting the total number of toys before the purchase from the total number of toys after the purchase.

Total number of toys before the purchase = B + A + R
= 31 + 8 + 9
= 48

Now, we can find the number of bouncy balls by subtracting the total number of toys before the purchase from the total number of toys after the purchase.

x = Total number of toys after the purchase - Total number of toys before the purchase
= 62 - 48
= 14

"Given the problem, we have three equations:

1. P + Pp + J = 100
2. Pp = J + 10
3. P = Pp + J

We can start by substituting equation (2) into equation (1):
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now, we can substitute equation (3) into the above equation:
(Pp + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Substitute Pp with J + 10:
(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 80/4
J = 20

Now that we have J, we can find Pp:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 20 + 10
Pp = 30

Now that we have Pp, we can find P:
P = Pp + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

"To determine the total number of water balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 balloon, and each of her 4 friends had 2 balloons. The total number of balloons initially is given by the sum of the balloons Maria had and the balloons her friends had: 1 + 4 * 2 = 1 + 8 = 9.

The additional balloons given by Maria's mom can be calculated by multiplying the number of people (5) by the number of additional balloons each person received (3): 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

The total number of water balloons is 24."
"To determine the number of tables required for the charity yard sale, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have and then divide that by the number of boxes that can fit per table.

First, let's calculate the total number of boxes from donations. Since 10 people donate 5 boxes each, we can express this as 10 * 5 = 50 boxes.

Adding the 10 boxes they already have, the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Now, we need to find out how many tables are required to accommodate these boxes. Since each table can hold 2 boxes, we divide the total number of boxes by 2: 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, they already own 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables required: 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 more tables for the yard sale.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To calculate the average total distance spat, we need to find the total distance spat by each person and then divide by the number of seeds.

Let's start by calculating the total distance spat by each person. Zoey's watermelon has 40 seeds, and she spits each one 10 feet. So, her total distance is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Similarly, Sydney's watermelon has 35 seeds, and she spits each one 12 feet. So, her total distance is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

Now, we need to find the total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney. This is simply the sum of their individual distances: 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

Next, we need to find the total number of seeds spat. This is the sum of the seeds from both watermelons: 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

Finally, we can calculate the average total distance spat by dividing the total distance spat by the total number of seeds: 820 / 75 = 10.93 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10.93}$"
"To determine the difference in revenue between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply the daily production by 30:

Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, we calculate the total revenue from each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

"To determine the cost of Cameron's stay, we need to calculate the cost of the 24-hour option and the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours.

Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours. 

The 24-hour option costs 1600 pesos. 

The 12-hour option costs 1000 pesos, and Cameron needs to add 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark. Since he stays for 17 hours, he needs to add 70 * 5 = 350 pesos for the additional 5 hours.

So, the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: 250"
"To determine the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep requires. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Let g represent the amount each goat needs (g = 5 pounds) and s represent the amount each sheep needs. Then, we can write the equation:

s = 2g - 3

Substituting g = 5 into the equation, we get:

s = 2(5) - 3
s = 10 - 3
s = 7

Now that we know each sheep needs 7 pounds, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 15 * 5 = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 12 * 7 = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"To determine the total number of children participating in the drill, we need to calculate the product of the number of children in each row, the number of rows, and the number of schools.

Given:
- Number of children in each row: 8
- Number of rows: 7
- Number of schools: 5

We can express this as a mathematical expression:

Total number of children = 8 * 7 * 5

Using the associative property of multiplication, we can rearrange the expression to facilitate easier calculation:

Total number of children = (8 * 7) * 5
Total number of children = 56 * 5
Total number of children = 280

Therefore, the total number of children participating in the drill is 280."
"To determine the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to calculate the total number of bottles given to the students and subtract that from the total number of bottles she received.

First, let's find the total number of bottles given to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice. This can be calculated as:

29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles

Next, we need to find the total number of bottles the teacher received. She has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. This can be calculated as:

9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Now, to find the number of bottles the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she received:

900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

Therefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To calculate the total amount Patty charged for the job, we need to break it down into its components. The labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked by the hourly rate. In this case, the job took 2.25 hours, and the labor rate is $35 per hour.

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour
Labor cost = $78.75

Next, we need to add the cost of parts, which is $60, and the visit fee, which is $40.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts + Visit fee
Total cost = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total cost = $178.75

Therefore, Patty charged a total of $178.75 for the job.

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To determine the amount James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs, the amount he received from selling the unwanted CDs, and then find the difference between the two.

The original price of 10 CDs is $15 each, so the total cost is $15 \* 10 = $150. However, James received a 40% discount, which is 0.4 \* $150 = $60. Therefore, the price after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he made a total of $40 \* 5 = $200.

To find the amount James was out, we subtract the amount he made from the amount he spent: $90 - $200 = -$110. The negative sign indicates a loss.

The final answer is: $110"
"To determine the total earnings from Jen's root crops, we need to calculate the revenue generated from each type of crop and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the yams: 6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.

Next, we'll calculate the revenue from the sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.

Lastly, we'll calculate the revenue from the carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.

Now, we'll sum the revenues from each type of root crop: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake at a pace of 2 miles per hour. To find the time it took him to swim this distance, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

First, we need to find 60% of 20 miles. This can be represented as:

0.6 × 20 = 12 miles

Now, we can find the time it took James to swim 12 miles:

Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday and then subtract 40 from that result.

Let's denote the number of loaves Sam had last Friday as S. We are given that S = 70.

The number of loaves the bakery has is seven times S minus 40, which can be expressed as 7S - 40.

Substituting the value of S, we get 7(70) - 40.

Using the distributive property of multiplication, we can rewrite this as 7 * 70 - 40.

Multiplying 7 and 70, we get 490.

Now, we subtract 40 from 490: 490 - 40 = 450.

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final answer is: 450"
"To determine the total number of stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to apply the principles of arithmetic operations. 

First, we start with the initial number of stickers Jasmine received, which is 15. Then, we subtract the number of stickers she lost during playtime, which is 7. This can be represented as:

15 - 7 = 8

Next, we add the number of stickers she received for helping her classmates, which is 5. This can be represented as:

8 + 5 = 13

Therefore, the total number of stickers Jasmine has at the end is 13.

13"
"To calculate the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times. The formula for commission is (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100. 

For the New York Times:
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
- Commission = 300 / 100
- Commission = $3

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
- Commission = 1200 / 100
- Commission = $12

Now, let's add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = $3 + $12
- Total commission = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Given the problem, we can represent the ages of Marcus, Leo, and Deanna using variables. Let's denote Deanna's age as D, Marcus's age as M, and Leo's age as L.

We are given the following information:

1. Deanna's age, D, is 26.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so M = D - 5.
3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so M = L/2.

We can substitute the value of D into the equation for M: M = 26 - 5 = 21.

Now, we can use the equation M = L/2 to find Leo's age. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 gives us L = 2M. Substituting the value of M, we get L = 2(21) = 42.

Therefore, Leo's age is 42.

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"Given that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points, with Bahati scoring the most points, which is 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored, we can denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D.

We can express the relationship between the points scored by Bahati and Azibo as B = A + 20. Similarly, the relationship between the points scored by Bahati and Dinar can be expressed as B = D + 10.

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. Subtracting 10 from both sides yields A = D + 10.

We also know that the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45, which can be expressed as B + A + D = 45.

Substituting B = A + 20 into the equation B + A + D = 45, we get (A + 20) + A + D = 45. Simplifying this equation yields 2A + D + 20 = 45.

Substituting B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45, we get (D + 10) + A + D = 45. Simplifying this equation yields 2D + A + 10 = 45.

Now we have two equations: 2A + D + 20 = 45 and 2D + A + 10 = 45. Subtracting the second equation from the first yields (2A + D + 20) - (2D + A + 10) = 45 - 45, which simplifies to A - D + 10 = 0.

Rearranging the equation A - D + 10 = 0 yields A - D = -10. Adding D to both sides yields A = D - 10.

Substituting A = D - 10 into the equation B = A + 20 yields B = (D - 10) + 20, which simplifies to B = D + 10.

Substituting B = D + 10 into the equation B = A + 20 yields D + 10 = A + 20. Subtracting 10 from both sides yields D = A + 10.

Substituting D = A + 10 into the equation A = D - 10 yields A = (A + 10) - 10, which simplifies to A = A.

Substituting D = A + 10 into the equation 2A + D + 20 = 45 yields 2(A + 10) + A + 20 = 45. Simplifying this equation yields 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtracting 30 from both sides yields 3A = 15. Dividing both sides by 3 yields A = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Given that the book is printed on paper with 100 pages per inch and each page is printed on both sides, we can calculate the total number of pages per inch as follows:

Pages per inch = 100 pages/inch * 2 (since each page is printed on both sides)
Pages per inch = 200 pages/inch

Now, we need to find the total number of pages in the book, which is 1.5 inches thick. To do this, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches:

Total pages = Pages per inch * Thickness of the book
Total pages = 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches
Total pages = 200 * 1.5
Total pages = 300 pages

Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked:
11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60:
15 \* 60 = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
900 ÷ 15 = 60

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 60 sets of 15 minutes, we multiply the number of reports per set by the number of sets:
30 \* 60 = 1800

The final answer is: 1800"
"To determine the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate her total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim's usual sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying 8 hours by 60 minutes per hour: 8 × 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her wake-up time is 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying 5 hours by 60 minutes per hour and adding the remaining 55 minutes: 5 × 60 + 55 = 335 minutes.

To find her actual sleep duration, we need to calculate the time she went to bed. Since she usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m., we can convert this to minutes: 10 × 60 = 600 minutes. Then, we subtract her wake-up time in minutes from her bedtime in minutes: 600 - 335 = 265 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her actual sleep duration: 265 - 23 = 242 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{242}$"
"To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we first need to calculate the initial number of measuring spoons he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we can express this as a numerical value: 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we know that Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. To find the number of spoons, we can multiply the number of cups by 2/3. This can be expressed as:

24 * (2/3) = 24 * 2 / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, we subtract 6 from the total number of spoons to find the remaining number of spoons:

16 - 6 = 10 spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining spoons and the number of cups:

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the initial number of occupied beds. Given that 1/5 of the hospital's 1000 beds are occupied, we can express this as a fraction and then convert it to a decimal.

1/5 of 1000 = (1/5) × 1000 = 200

Since 1/5 of the beds are occupied, 4/5 of the beds are unoccupied. We can express this as:

4/5 of 1000 = (4/5) × 1000 = 800

Now, we need to calculate the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. With 50 patients admitted each day, we multiply this number by the number of days in 2 weeks (14).

50 patients/day × 14 days = 700 patients

Adding the initial number of occupied beds to the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks gives us the total number of occupied beds:

200 (initially occupied) + 700 (admitted in 2 weeks) = 900

To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's total capacity:

1000 (total capacity) - 900 (total occupied) = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Robyn sends 16 emails a day, of which 7 are work-related. The number of non-work emails is therefore 16 - 7 = 9.

Now, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are to family. Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family, which can be expressed as (2/3) × 9. To calculate this, we multiply the numerator (2) by the denominator (3) and then divide by the denominator (3), resulting in (2 × 3) / 3 = 6 / 3 = 2. However, we must multiply 2 by 9 to get the correct answer: 2 × 9 = 18, then divide by 3: 18 / 3 = 6. Alternatively, we can multiply 2 by 9 and then divide by 3: (2/3) × 9 = (2 × 9) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6. So, 6 emails are to family.

Now, we need to find out how many of the non-work emails are not to family. This is 9 - 6 = 3.

Next, we need to find out how many of these emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of the remaining non-work emails are to her boyfriend, which can be expressed as (1/3) × 3. To calculate this, we multiply the numerator (1) by the denominator (3) and then divide by the denominator (3), resulting in (1 × 3) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a series of equations to solve for Shawna's father's age.

Let's denote Shawna's age as S, Aliya's age as A, and Shawna's father's age as F.

From the information provided, we have the following equations:

1. F = 5S (Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna)
2. S = 3A (Shawna is three times as old as Aliya)
3. A = 3 (Aliya is 3 years old)

Substituting equation 3 into equation 2, we get:
S = 3 * 3
S = 9

Now, substitute S into equation 1 to find Shawna's father's age:
F = 5 * 9
F = 45

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported by Courtney and subtract it from the number reported by Courtney.

Let's denote the number reported by Courtney as x. Since Kelly stated that Courtney overstated the number by 20%, we can express this as an equation:

x = actual number of people + 20% of the actual number of people

We know that Courtney reported 48 people, so we can set up the equation as follows:

48 = actual number of people + 0.20 * actual number of people

Combine like terms:

48 = 1.20 * actual number of people

Now, divide both sides by 1.20 to solve for the actual number of people:

actual number of people = 48 / 1.20

actual number of people = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"Given the scenario, let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls. Similarly, since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 * 2x = 4x balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them. Therefore, the total number of balls is x + 2x + 4x = 7x.

We are also given that Jason carried 2 balls. Since Jason carried 2x balls, we can set up the equation 2x = 2 and solve for x.

2x = 2
x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the total number of balls by substituting x into the equation 7x.

Total number of balls = 7x
Total number of balls = 7 * 1
Total number of balls = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the pirates and then determine how many holes they dug on the fourth day.

Let's start by calculating the total number of holes dug on the first three days. The pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes dug on the first three days is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

We are given that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"Given that Amora and Lainey received an equal number of corn chips, denoted as x, and Collins received 15 more corn chips than each of them, we can express the total number of corn chips as the sum of their individual portions.

Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey received as x. Since Collins received 15 more corn chips than each of them, Collins received x + 15 corn chips.

We are given that Amora and Lainey received 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

Since Collins received x + 15 corn chips, we can set up the equation:

x + 15 = 70 + 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 15 = 85

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get:

x = 70

This confirms that Amora and Lainey received 70 corn chips each. Now, we need to find the total number of corn chips. We know that Collins received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins received:

Total = x + x + (x + 15)
Total = 2x + (x + 15)
Total = 3x + 15
Total = 3(70) + 15
Total = 210 + 15
Total = 225

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To determine the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, we find 50% of the cost of supplies: 50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Then, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel: $400 + $200 = $600.

The cost of travel is $600."
"Given the problem, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of Pokémon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L.

We have the following system of equations:

1. A + S + L = 339 (The total number of Pokémon caught by the three trainers)
2. L = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan)
3. S = 4A - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe)

We can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to eliminate L:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute equation (3) into the previous equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S by substituting A into equation (3):
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a direct relationship between the number of episodes and the total time spent watching the show. Let's denote the number of episodes as 'e' and the length of each episode as 'l'. We are given that the length of each episode is 20 minutes, so l = 20.

We are also given that the number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. This can be expressed as e = l / 2. Substituting the value of l, we get e = 20 / 2 = 10.

To find the total time spent watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: Total Time = e * l = 10 * 20 = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes. To solve this, we need to consider the bird's movements in the southerly and northerly directions.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction. The bird flies for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. Using the formula distance = speed * time, we get:

distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

Next, the bird turns direction and flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. This results in a distance of:

distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Finally, the bird changes direction and flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour, covering a distance of:

distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, to find the net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction.

Net distance = Total distance in the southerly direction - Distance in the northerly direction
Net distance = (300 miles + 110 miles) - 36 miles
Net distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta received. We can start by adding the number of brownies she made for herself, which is 1 dozen, or 12 brownies. 

12 brownies (made for herself) + 1/2 dozen brownies (from the office) = 12 + 6 = 18 brownies

Since 1/2 dozen is equivalent to 6, we can directly add it to the initial 12 brownies.

Next, we add the 4 dozen brownies she received from her friends, which is 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.

Total brownies received = 18 + 48 = 66

Now, let's calculate the number of brownies eaten. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is equivalent to 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

Total brownies left over = Total brownies received - brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to determine the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age can be calculated as 2 × 8 = 16 years.

To find Nani's sister's age, we need to calculate 75% of Nani's age, which is equivalent to 0.75 × 8 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

P = 2(length + width)

Given the length of the garden is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(15 + 10)
P = 2(25)
P = 50 feet

Since Robert requires 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to find the total number of slats needed:

Total slats needed = P * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we calculate the total number of oranges she had initially. Since she bought 12 boxes, each containing 20 oranges, the total number of oranges is 12 * 20 = 240.

Next, we need to find out how many oranges she gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so the total number of boxes given away is 2 + 2 = 4. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges given away is 4 * 20 = 80.

Now, we need to find out how many oranges she kept. She kept 1/4 of the total oranges, which is 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 240 - 60 = 180 oranges.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the total number of states in both the USA and India, we need to determine the number of states in each country. 

The USA has 50 states. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. To find half of 50, we divide 50 by 2, which is 25. Then, we add 4 to 25, resulting in 29 states in India.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India to find the total: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"To determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to purchase. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 

The total cost of the items is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Given that Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can find the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$\frac{25}{5} = 5$

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as R, the number of cherries Jerry has as J, and the total number of cherries as T. We are given that T = 60, R = 30, and R = J + 10.

We can express the total number of cherries as the sum of the cherries each person has: T = R + J. Substituting the given values, we get 60 = 30 + J. Solving for J, we have J = 60 - 30 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of cherries Robert has and the number of cherries Jerry has. This can be expressed as R - J. Substituting the values we found, we get 30 - 30 = 0.

However, we are given that Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, which means our initial assumption that R = J + 10 is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem. If R = J + 10, then J = R - 10. Substituting this into the equation T = R + J, we get 60 = R + R - 10. Simplifying, we get 60 = 2R - 10. Adding 10 to both sides, we get 70 = 2R. Dividing both sides by 2, we get R = 35.

Now that we know R, we can find J by substituting R into the equation J = R - 10. J = 35 - 10 = 25.

The difference between the number of cherries Robert has and the number of cherries Jerry has is R - J = 35 - 25 = 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Let's analyze the given problem.

Let G represent the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday and A represent the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.

We are given that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.

We are also given that on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so A = Sunday's apple pie - 4.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so Sunday's gingerbread = G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, we can find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
A = Sunday's apple pie - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

Total earnings on Saturday = (G * 6) + (A * 15) = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225.
Total earnings on Sunday = (Sunday's gingerbread * 6) + (Sunday's apple pie * 15) = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315.

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday = 225 + 315 = 540.

The final answer is: $\boxed{540}$"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need, we must calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use during her 8-day vacation.

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. Over 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day for 8 days, which is 4 * 8 = 32 times.

The amount of sunscreen used each time is 1 ounce. Therefore, the total amount of sunscreen used is 32 ounces.

To find the number of bottles needed, we divide the total amount of sunscreen used (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 ÷ 8 = 4

Thus, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

The price of the blue car is given as $100. To find 40% of this amount, we multiply it by 0.4 (since 40% is equivalent to 40/100 or 0.4).

Discount = 0.4 × $100
= $40

Now, we subtract the discount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car.

Price of red car = Price of blue car - Discount
= $100 - $40
= $60

The price of the red car is $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we add the prices of the blue and red cars.

Total cost = Price of blue car + Price of red car
= $100 + $60
= $160

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's current age as D, and his brother's current age as B. We are given the following information:

1. E = 19 (Emil's current age)
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad: 24 = (1/2)(D + 5)
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother: 24 = 2(B + 5)

From equation (3), we can solve for B:
24 = 2(B + 5)
24 = 2B + 10
24 - 10 = 2B
14 = 2B
B = 7

Now, substitute B = 7 into equation (2):
24 = (1/2)(D + 5)
24 = (1/2)D + 2.5
24 - 2.5 = (1/2)D
21.5 = (1/2)D
21.5 * 2 = D
43 = D

Now that we have the current ages of Emil's dad (D = 43) and brother (B = 7), we can find their sum:
D + B = 43 + 7 = 50

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads given by her mother, sister, and friend, and then sum them up.

Let's start by identifying the number of beads given by each individual. 

Her mother gave her 20 beads. 

Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so the number of beads given by her sister is 20 + 10 = 30.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so the number of beads given by her friend is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (mother) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

Let's start by calculating the amount of crawfish Joe caught on each day. On Thursday, he caught 3 pounds of crawfish. On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is 4 × 3 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 ÷ 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 ÷ 3 = 7.

The final numerical answer is: 7"
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to determine the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members.

First, let's calculate the number of football players. 20% of the class are football players, which is equivalent to 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we need to find the number of remaining students. Since 6 students are football players, the remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24.

Now, let's calculate the number of cheerleaders or band members. 25% of the remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or band members, which is equivalent to 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders or band members. Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To find the average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie, we need to calculate the arithmetic mean of their shoe sizes. 

Let's denote Sophie's shoe size as S = 5. Since Charlie's shoe size is five times that of Sophie's, we can express it as C = 5S = 5 * 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the sum of their shoe sizes: S + C = 5 + 25 = 30.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 2: (S + C) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

Therefore, the average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of flowers for Pat's flower bed, we need to calculate the number of plants she can fit in the bed and then multiply that by the cost of each plant.

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant, we need to subtract 18 inches from the total length of the flower bed for each plant. However, we also need to subtract the width of the plant itself (12 inches) from the remaining length.

Let's denote the number of plants as 'n'. The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is 1332 - 18n - 12n = 1320 - 30n.

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 'n - 17' more flowers. The total cost of the flowers will be the number of flowers she needs to buy multiplied by the cost of each flower, which is (n - 17) * 6.

We know that the total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is equal to the width of the plant (12 inches) multiplied by the number of plants (n). So, we can set up the equation: 12n = 1320 - 30n.

To solve for 'n', we can add 30n to both sides of the equation: 42n = 1320. Then, we can divide both sides by 42: n = 1320 / 42 = 31.4286. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 31 plants.

Now that we know Pat needs 31 - 17 = 14 more flowers, we can calculate the total cost: 14 * 6 = 84.

The final answer is: $84"
"To determine the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to calculate his daily consumption. Since he eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, who consumes 18 pretzels per day, we can find this by dividing 18 by 2.

18 ÷ 2 = 9

Now, we need to find the total number of pretzels his brother eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily consumption by 7.

9 × 7 = 63

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"To determine the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

Next, we'll calculate the cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Now, we add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines to find the total cost: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To determine the number of roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

The amount of soil required for the sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

The amount of soil required for the carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

The total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, the amount of soil left for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Given that each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate her monthly savings. Given that she sets aside 25% of her monthly income, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 25 by 100: 25 ÷ 100 = 0.25.

Now, we can multiply her monthly income by this decimal to find her monthly savings: $2,000.00 × 0.25 = $500.00.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can multiply her monthly savings by 12 to find her annual savings: $500.00 × 12 = $6,000.00.

To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy, we divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes: $6,000.00 ÷ $1,000.00 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both tasks simultaneously. 

First, let's analyze the peeling task. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them: 90 ÷ 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, we'll examine the cooking task. Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she cooks them: 90 ÷ 30 = 3. Since she can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, it will take her 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we need to find the maximum time between the two tasks. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The maximum time is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. The total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

2. Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. The total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

3. The total cooling effect is the sum of the cooling effects in both low and high modes: 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

4. However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

5. The net cooling effect is the difference between the total cooling effect and the warming effect: 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as x. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time.

We are given that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Let's denote Bill's dad's age when he saw the comet as y. Then, we have the equation:

3y = 90

Solving for y, we get:

y = 30

This means Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time. Therefore, Bill was born 75 years after his dad saw the comet.

We also know that Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 75 = 30

Solving for x, we get:

x = -45

However, this is not possible since age cannot be negative. Let's re-examine the problem. We are given that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. This means that the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years, and the age difference between the two sightings is 60 years (3 times 20 years).

Let's denote the time elapsed between the two sightings as t. We have the equation:

t = 75

We also know that the age difference between the two sightings is 60 years. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the age difference between the two sightings is 60 years. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 75 = 3(30)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 75 = 90

Solving for x, we get:

x = 15

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final answer is: 15"
"As an arithmetic expert, I'll break down the problem into manageable parts to calculate the total number of checks Buford writes per year.

First, let's consider the frequency of each type of check:

- Electric bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
- Gas bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
- Church donations: 2 checks per month, so 24 checks per year.
- Pest and lawn service: 1 check every 3 months, which is equivalent to 4 checks per year.

To find the total number of checks, we simply add the number of checks for each category:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year.

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. Let's start by identifying the number of flights made by the first plane. We know that the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane. Therefore, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights.

Now, let's consider the distribution of flights for the first plane. It goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is (3/4) * 88 = 66 flights. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the combined length of time the three wolves' howls. To approach this, we need to determine the individual howling times and then sum them up.

Let's denote the howling time of Tobias as T, Chikote as C, and Igneous as I. We are given that T = 20 seconds. Since Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, we can express this as C = 2T = 2(20) = 40 seconds.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so I = T + C = 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we can calculate the total howling time by adding the individual howling times: T + C + I = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Let's denote the amount Adam's mother gave him as M and the amount his father gave him as F. We know that F = 2M.

Given that Adam's mother gave him $6, we can write M = $6.

Since F = 2M, we can substitute the value of M to find F: F = 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is the sum of M and F: M + F = $6 + $12 = $18.

Now, we can find the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings by subtracting the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"Given the problem, we can denote the age of Wilfred as W. The total age of the children is 20, and we know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro. 

Let's express the total age of the children as an equation:
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
3 + 4 + Helene's age + W = 20

We are also given that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. 
Average age = (3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)

We can simplify the equation by substituting Helene's age in terms of the average age:
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)
Helene's age = (2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)) / 4
4 * Helene's age = 2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)
4 * Helene's age = 14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W
2 * Helene's age = 14 + 2W
Helene's age = 7 + W

Now we can substitute Helene's age in the first equation:
3 + 4 + (7 + W) + W = 20
12 + 2W = 20
2W = 8
W = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Let's denote the amount collected from the neighbors as N and the amount collected from the online fund as O. We are given that N = $500 and O = $1500.

The total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund is N + O = $500 + $1500 = $2000.

However, we are also told that Walter's friend donates $200, but this amount is not included in the amount that the lawyer will multiply by 3. Therefore, the amount the lawyer will multiply by 3 is still $2000.

The lawyer will donate 3 times this amount, which is 3 × $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. First, we calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception by the guests. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is given by the product of these two quantities:

Total number of cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest
= 1500 cookies

Next, we need to find out how many cookies were given to the church. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church, so we multiply the total number of cookies by 1/2:

Cookies given to the church = 1500 cookies * 1/2
= 1500 * 0.5
= 750 cookies

Now, we know that each person in the church received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

Number of people in the church = Cookies given to the church / Cookies per person
= 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person
= 50 people

Therefore, the number of people in the church is 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"Given a family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) dividing a watermelon such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can approach this problem using ratios and proportions.

Let's assume the total watermelon is represented by a variable, say 'T'. Since each adult gets twice as much as each kid, we can set up a ratio of adult to kid portions as 2:1.

Let's denote the portion of the watermelon each kid gets as 'x'. Then, the portion each adult gets is 2x. The total portion for the kids is 4x (4 kids * x units each), and the total portion for the adults is 2x (2 adults * 2x units each).

We know that the sum of the portions for the kids and adults must equal the total watermelon, T. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 4x + 2x = T.

Simplifying the equation, we get 6x = T.

To find the portion each adult gets, we need to determine the value of x. However, we don't know the total watermelon, T. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we can express the portion each adult gets as a fraction of the total and then convert it to a percentage.

Let's express the portion each adult gets as a fraction: (2x / T) * 100.

Since 6x = T, we can substitute T with 6x in the fraction: (2x / 6x) * 100.

Simplifying the fraction, we get (1/3) * 100.

To find the percentage, we multiply 1/3 by 100: (1/3) * 100 = 33.33%.

Therefore, each adult gets 33.33% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{33.33}$"
"To determine the time Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from his total work hours.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 9 × 20 = 180 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 10 × 30 = 300 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 480 ÷ 60 = 8 hours.

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"As a time management expert, I'll break down the problem into manageable chunks to determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake.

First, let's calculate the total time required to make the cake:

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

To convert 180 minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time required from the desired serving time to find the latest start time. 

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

"Given that Lisa and Peter sold a total of 64 chocolate bars, with Lisa selling 3.5 boxes and Peter selling 4.5 boxes, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let x be the number of chocolate bars in a box. Then, the total number of chocolate bars sold by Lisa is 3.5x, and the total number of chocolate bars sold by Peter is 4.5x. The sum of their sales is 64, so we can write the equation:

3.5x + 4.5x = 64

Combine like terms to simplify the equation:

8x = 64

To solve for x, divide both sides of the equation by 8:

x = 64/8

x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

Let's denote the cost of renting the studio per session as $C_r = 25 and the cost per student per session as $C_s = 1.50. The number of students is given as n = 10, and the studio is rented 3 days a week. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the number of sessions in a month is s = 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The total cost per session is the sum of the cost of renting the studio and the cost of students, which is C_total = C_r + n * C_s = 25 + 10 * 1.50 = 25 + 15 = 40 dollars.

To find the total earnings per month, we multiply the total cost per session by the number of sessions in a month: Earnings = C_total * s = 40 * 12 = 480 dollars.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as x. Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, the total number of chocolate bars he has is 4x. Similarly, since Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, the total number of chocolate bars she has is 7x.

We are given that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can set up the following system of linear equations:

4x = 64
7x = 56

Solving the first equation for x, we get:
x = 64 / 4
x = 16

Now, we can substitute this value of x into the second equation to verify:
7(16) = 56
112 = 112

Since the equation holds true, our solution is correct. Now, we can find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the population of porcupines in the park after a year, we first need to calculate the number of female porcupines, which is 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

To find the total number of porcupines after a year, we add the initial population and the number of babies born.

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 48 = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To determine the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism, which is given by the formula:

V = lwh

where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth) of the prism.

Given the dimensions of the pool: length (l) = 25 feet, width (w) = 14 feet, and depth (h) = 4 feet, we can calculate the volume as follows:

V = lwh
V = 25 * 14 * 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

However, the pool company requires us to multiply the volume by 5.9 to determine the number of gallons of water needed. This is likely due to the fact that 1 cubic foot of water is approximately equal to 7.48 gallons. Therefore, we can convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons by multiplying by 7.48, and then multiply by 5.9:

Gallons = (V * 7.48) * 5.9
Gallons = (1400 * 7.48) * 5.9
Gallons = 10432 * 5.9
Gallons = 61423.2 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost to fill the pool by multiplying the number of gallons by the cost per gallon, which is $0.10:

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 61423.2 * 0.10
Cost = 6142.32

The final answer is: $6142.32"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. Let's start by identifying the number of red sticks, which is given as 9. 

Next, we're told that there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. This can be represented as an equation: blue sticks = red sticks + 5. Substituting the given value for red sticks, we get blue sticks = 9 + 5 = 14.

Now, we're informed that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. This can be represented as an equation: yellow sticks = blue sticks - 3. Substituting the value for blue sticks, we get yellow sticks = 14 - 3 = 11.

To find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: total sticks = red sticks + blue sticks + yellow sticks = 9 + 14 + 11.

Performing the arithmetic, we get: total sticks = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between Matteo and Shandy, we need to calculate their individual distances and then find the difference between them.

First, we'll calculate Matteo's distance by multiplying his speed (55 miles per hour) by the time he traveled (4 hours).

Matteo's distance = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Next, we'll calculate Shandy's distance by multiplying his speed (45 miles per hour) by the time he traveled (10 hours).

Shandy's distance = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we'll find the difference between their distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo.

Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{230}$"
"To determine the number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we need to break down the information provided.

First, we know that half of the 3000 students are over 16 years old, which is 1500 students. Since one-fourth of these students are male, we can calculate the number of male students over 16 as follows:

1500 (students over 16) × 1/4 = 375 (male students over 16)

Now, we can find the number of female students over 16 by subtracting the number of male students from the total number of students over 16:

1500 (students over 16) - 375 (male students over 16) = 1125 (female students over 16)

Next, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which is also 1500 students. Since one-half of these students are male, we can calculate the number of male students under 16 as follows:

1500 (students under 16) × 1/2 = 750 (male students under 16)

Now, we can find the number of female students under 16 by subtracting the number of male students from the total number of students under 16:

1500 (students under 16) - 750 (male students under 16) = 750 (female students under 16)

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16:

1125 (female students over 16) + 750 (female students under 16) = 1875 (total female students)

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of laps Bethany and Quinn can run, we need to analyze the given information step by step.

Let's denote the number of laps Bethany can run as B, Trey as T, Shaelyn as S, and Quinn as Q.

From the problem statement, we have the following relationships:
1. B = 10 (Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour)
2. T = B + 4 (Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany)
3. S = T / 2 (Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey)
4. Q = S - 2 (Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn)

Now, let's substitute the values step by step:
1. T = 10 + 4 = 14
2. S = 14 / 2 = 7
3. Q = 7 - 2 = 5

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of laps Bethany and Quinn can run, which is B - Q.
B - Q = 10 - 5 = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

Let's break down the water pumped into the tank on the first day. Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is $\frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500$ gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped $\frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375$ gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is $\frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000$ gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is $\frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125$ gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is $4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000$ gallons.

The amount of water remaining in the tank is $18000 - 12000 = 6000$ gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to model the situation. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

We can represent this as an equation: x - (0.09 * 5)x = 0.55x

Simplifying the equation, we get: x - 0.45x = 0.55x
Combine like terms: 0.55x = 0.55x

"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15, resulting in a total hourly earnings of $25.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:

Weekly Earnings = Hourly Earnings × Number of Hours Worked
= $25/hour × 40 hours/week
= $1000/week

Next, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. To calculate 20% of $10,000, we multiply $10,000 by 0.20:

Down Payment Amount = $10,000 × 0.20
= $2,000

Now, we can determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment by dividing the down payment amount by her weekly earnings:

Number of Weeks = Down Payment Amount ÷ Weekly Earnings
= $2,000 ÷ $1,000
= 2

"To determine the number of plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the remaining funds after purchasing the other fruits. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 × 0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 × 0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 × 1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 × 0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so we subtract the total cost of the fruits from his initial amount to find the remaining funds:
$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Now, we need to find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75. Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum:
$\frac{0.75}{0.25} = 3$

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to calculate the total number of packs given away by Anne. Since she kept 2 packs, the number of packs given away is 15 - 2 = 13.

To find the number of pieces in 1.3 packs, we multiply 0.3 packs by the number of pieces in one pack, which is 60: 0.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 18 pieces.

Therefore, each friend received 1 pack * 60 pieces/pack + 0.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 60 + 18 = 78 pieces.

The final answer is: 78"
"The price of carrots in Mrs. Tatiana's grocery store increases by 5% of the original price every year. To calculate the price after three years, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal amount (initial price), r is the annual interest rate (or in this case, the percentage increase), and n is the number of years.

Given the initial price of carrots is $120 and the annual increase is 5%, we can plug in the values into the formula:

A = 120(1 + 0.05)^3

First, we calculate the value inside the parentheses:
(1 + 0.05) = 1.05

Now, we raise 1.05 to the power of 3:
(1.05)^3 ≈ 1.157625

Now, we multiply the initial price by this value:
A ≈ 120 * 1.157625 ≈ 139.145

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums to find the number of pictures in each album.

Let's denote the number of pictures in each album as x. Since Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can set up the equation:

72 = 8x

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

x = 72 / 8
x = 9

Now that we know the number of pictures in each album, we can find the number of selfies and portraits. Since 3 albums were selfies only, the number of selfies is 3x = 3(9) = 27.

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 - 3 - 2 = 3 albums. 
The number of portraits is 3x = 3(9) = 27.

Therefore, the total number of portraits and selfies is 27 selfies + 27 portraits = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine the time James spends reading, we need to calculate the number of sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set.

Let's denote the total number of pages James reads as P, the number of pages per set as p, and the time it takes to read one set as t. We are given P = 18, p = 3, and t = 10 minutes.

To find the number of sets, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages per set: P/p = 18/3 = 6 sets.

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the time it takes to read one set to find the total time spent reading: 6 sets * 10 minutes/set = 60 minutes.

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading his book.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, there were 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the number of guests remaining is 61 + 30 = 91.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the total number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the total number of bananas John has, we need to calculate the bananas he picked on each day and then sum them up.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas. This is a straightforward count.

On Thursday, John picked 6 bananas, which is another straightforward count.

On Friday, John picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. To calculate this, we multiply the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday by 3: 4 × 3 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas he picked on each day: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

Therefore, the total number of bananas John has is 22."
"To determine the number of points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, and then find out how many of each she is sure to get.

First, let's find out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are in the quiz:
- Total questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.4 × 60 = 24
- Average and difficult questions: 60 - 24 = 36
- Average questions: 36 / 2 = 18
- Difficult questions: 36 / 2 = 18

Now, let's find out how many of each type of question Aries is sure to get:
- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 × 24 = 18
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 × 18 = 9
- Difficult questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 × 18 = 9

Now, let's add up the number of questions Aries is sure to get:
18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'. We know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4 and the price of a large stuffed animal is $12, which is three times the price of a small one.

We are given that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: x = 2y.

We also know that the total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write another equation: 4x + 12y = 120.

Substituting x = 2y into the second equation, we get: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since x = 2y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches the family consumes in one week, we need to calculate the daily consumption and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

The family's daily sandwich consumption can be calculated as follows:

- The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

Total daily consumption = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total weekly consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7:

Total weekly consumption = 11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week.

Therefore, the family consumes 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To determine Suzanne's remaining earnings, we need to calculate her total revenue and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate her revenue from selling cookies:
80 cookies * $1 each = $80

Next, let's calculate her revenue from selling cupcakes:
60 cupcakes * $4 each = $240

Now, let's add her revenue from cookies and cupcakes:
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave a total of:
2 * $10 = $20

Now, let's subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total revenue:
$320 - $20 = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of eggs found by the friends, we need to apply basic arithmetic principles. 

First, we calculate the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins. Since there are two twins and each found 30 eggs, we multiply the number of eggs found by one twin by 2.

Eggs found by the Smith twins = 30 * 2 = 60

Next, we need to subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the remaining unfound eggs from the total number of eggs to find the number of eggs found by the friends.

Eggs found by the friends = Total eggs - (Eggs found by the Smith twins + Remaining unfound eggs)
= 100 - (60 + 10)
= 100 - 70
= 30

Therefore, the number of eggs found by the friends is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the amount of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to calculate the daily ore production and then multiply it by the number of days in the month.

First, let's find the daily ore production of one dwarf with a steel pickaxe. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pounds per day. 

To find the daily ore production with a steel pickaxe, we need to calculate 50% more than the iron pickaxe production. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. Therefore, the daily ore production with a steel pickaxe is 24 + 12 = 36 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the daily ore production of 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes: 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply the daily production by 30 to find the monthly production: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final numerical answer is: 43200"
"Given the problem, we can establish a proportionality relationship between the number of sandwiches and their respective prices. Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as x.

We know that the price of the first package with 2 sandwiches is $3, and the price of the second package with 4 sandwiches is $6. Since the prices are proportional, we can set up a proportion:

(3/2) = (6/4) = (x/8)

To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can cross-multiply and solve for x:

3 * 8 = 6 * 2
24 = 12
x = 24/6
x = 4 * 6 / 6
x = 4

However, this is not the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, but rather the price per sandwich. To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches:

x = 4 * 8
x = 32

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to revisit the proportionality relationship. The correct proportionality relationship is:

(3/2) = (6/4) = (x/8)

We can simplify the proportion by multiplying both sides by 8:

"To determine the monthly payment for the bedroom set, we need to calculate the remaining balance after Tom pays $1000 from the sale of his old bedroom set.

The initial cost of the bedroom set is $3000. After paying $1000, the remaining balance is:

$3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, we need to calculate the monthly payment, which is 10% of the remaining balance. To find 10% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.10.

Monthly payment = $2000 × 0.10
Monthly payment = $200

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.

The final answer is: $200"
"To determine the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.

1. 40% of the red balloons burst:
   Number of red balloons that burst = 0.4 * 25 = 10
   Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15

2. Half of the yellow balloons were released:

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance of convincing the teacher, and 60% chance of the teacher not giving an extension). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability of having to turn in his homework.

Let's calculate the total probability of not having to turn in his homework: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. Since 102% is not a valid probability, we need to subtract 100% from it to get a negative number, which is not possible. However, we can subtract 100% from 102% to get 2% and then subtract 2% from 100% to get 98%. 

The probability of not having to turn in his homework is 2%. However, this is not possible since the probability cannot be greater than 100%. This means we need to subtract 100% from 102% to get -2% and then add 100% to -2% to get 98%. 

The probability of not having to turn in his homework is 98%. However, this is not the probability we are looking for. We want to find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework. 

The probability of having to turn in his homework is 100% - 98% = 2%."
"To determine the number of tickets each graduate can receive, we need to calculate the available seating in the Fine Arts Center after accounting for the reserved seats.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates and faculty = 950

Available seats = Total capacity - Reserved seats
Available seats = 6000 - 950
Available seats = 5050

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5050 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5.32

Since we can't give a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the question asks for the number of tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, implying that the remaining tickets are for guests.

Therefore, the answer is 5 tickets per graduate."
"To determine the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans. We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. This implies that the ratio of large to medium-sized beans is 1:2.

We can express this relationship as a proportion: 75 large beans = 150 medium beans. 

Now, we need to find the relationship between medium-sized and small beans. We are given that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. This can be expressed as a ratio: 3 small beans = 1 medium bean.

To find the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium beans, we can set up a proportion: 3 small beans / 1 medium bean = x small beans / 150 medium beans.

We can solve for x by cross-multiplying: 3 * 150 = 1 * x, which simplifies to 450 = x.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

The final answer is: $\boxed{450}$"
"To determine Melissa's hourly pay after expenses, we need to calculate her net earnings and then divide that by the total number of hours she worked.

First, let's calculate her total earnings: 3 days * $15 per day = $45.

Next, we need to calculate her total expenses: 3 days * $3 per day = $9.

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: 
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Since Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, we need to find the total number of hours she worked:
Total hours = 6 hours/day * 3 days
Total hours = 18 hours

Now, let's calculate her hourly pay after expenses:
Hourly pay after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours
Hourly pay after expenses = $36 / 18
Hourly pay after expenses = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils, then add them together.

The cost of 3 books can be calculated as follows: 3 × 16 = 48 dollars.

Similarly, the cost of 3 pencils is: 3 × 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, to find the total cost, we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Therefore, the total amount spent is $66.

The final answer is: $66"
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of soda bottles and then multiply it by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

Given that the driveway is 24 feet wide and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can find the total number of bottles by dividing the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can find the total time by multiplying the number of bottles by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:

Total time = 8 bottles * 5 seconds/bottle = 40 seconds

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the number of packs Uncle Franky can make, we need to calculate the total number of apples he has and then divide that by the number of apples in each pack.

Given that each box contains 40 apples and Uncle Franky ordered two boxes, we can calculate the total number of apples as follows:

Total apples = Number of boxes * Apples per box
Total apples = 2 * 40
Total apples = 80

Now, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples, where each pack contains 8 apples. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack:

Number of packs = Total apples / Apples per pack
Number of packs = 80 / 8
Number of packs = 10

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

"To determine the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she purchased and subtract it from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 × $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 × $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Given that Amor starts with $50, we can calculate the remaining amount of money she has by subtracting the total cost of the cheese from the initial amount: $50 - $40 = $10.

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

The final answer is: $10"
"To determine the time it takes for Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn and his new annual income after college.

The total amount of money he needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income: $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find the number of years it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can use the formula for the time value of money:

Time = Total Amount / Annual Income

Plugging in the values, we get:

Time = $300,000 / $75,000/year

Time = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total area of fabric Jim needs, we must first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. Given that the bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of one piece of fabric is calculated as the product of its length and width, which is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim requires two identical pieces, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them together.

Let's start with Monday. The post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. To find one-fifth of 425, we divide 425 by 5:

$$\frac{425}{5} = 85$$

Then, we add 17 to this result to find the total number of letters delivered on Tuesday:

$$85 + 17 = 102$$

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. To find twice as many as Tuesday, we multiply 102 by 2:

$$102 \times 2 = 204$$

Then, we add 5 to this result to find the total number of letters delivered on Wednesday:

$$204 + 5 = 209$$

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day:

$$425 + 102 + 209 = 736$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{736}$"

The final answer is: $101"
"To calculate the average loss, we need to determine the total loss and then divide it by the number of races.

Let's break down the losses and gains from each race:

1. In the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. This can be expressed as 2(-$5) + $1 = -$9.
3. In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. This can be expressed as 1.5(-$9) = -$13.50.

Now, let's calculate the total loss: -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.50) = -$27.50.

The number of races is 3. To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races: -$27.50 / 3 = -$9.17.

The final answer is: $9.17"
"To determine the total population of South America, we need to apply the fundamental principles of arithmetic operations. Specifically, we will utilize the concept of multiplication to find the total population.

First, we identify the number of countries in South America, which is 26. Next, we know that each country has 5 cities, and each city has a population of 1000 people. To find the total population, we will multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country and then multiply the result by the population per city.

The calculation can be represented as follows:

Total population = (Number of countries) × (Number of cities per country) × (Population per city)
Total population = 26 × 5 × 1000

Using the associative property of multiplication, we can rearrange the order of operations to simplify the calculation:

Total population = (26 × 5) × 1000
Total population = 130 × 1000

Now, we can multiply 130 by 1000:

Total population = 130 × 1000
Total population = 130,000

Therefore, the total population of South America is 130,000.

The final answer is: 130000"
"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier's height can be found by converting his height from feet to inches and then adding the growth. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches. Adding the 3 inches he grew over the summer, Xavier's current height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

Cole's height is given as 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer. Therefore, Cole's current height is 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier by subtracting Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

Therefore, the share of the first person is $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To calculate the total hours worked by each painter, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, let's determine the total number of days worked. Since there are 7 days in a week, 3 weeks is equivalent to 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Next, we need to convert the fraction of a day worked by the painters to hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can convert 3/8ths to hours as follows:

$$\frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9$$

Now, we can calculate the total hours worked by the painters in 21 days:

$$9 \text{ hours/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 189 \text{ hours}$$

Since there are 4 painters, we can find the total hours worked by each painter by dividing the total hours by 4:

$$\frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{47.25}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x.

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Combine like terms and eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Distribute the 2:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the price of a car after a certain number of years, given an initial price and a constant annual depreciation rate. This is a classic example of exponential decay, where the price of the car decreases by a fixed percentage each year.

The formula for exponential decay is given by:

P(t) = P0 * (1 - r)^t

where:
- P(t) is the price at time t
- P0 is the initial price
- r is the depreciation rate (as a decimal)
- t is the time in years

Given:
- Initial price (P0) = $20,000
- Depreciation rate (r) = 21% = 0.21
- Time (t) = 3 years (from 2007 to 2010)

We can plug in the values into the formula:

P(3) = $20,000 * (1 - 0.21)^3
= $20,000 * (0.79)^3
= $20,000 * 0.4914
= $9,828

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $9,828.

The final answer is: $9828"
"To find the number of Spanish books in the library, we need to determine the number of books written in English and German first. 

Since half of the books are written in English, we can express this as 50 * 0.5 = 25 books in English.
For the German books, 10% of the total books are written in German, which can be calculated as 50 * 0.1 = 5 books.

Now, we add the number of English and German books to find the total number of books written in these two languages: 25 + 5 = 30 books.

To find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the total number of English and German books from the total number of books in the library: 50 - 30 = 20 books.

The final answer is: 20"

"To determine the amount of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to calculate her daily water consumption in gallons and then multiply it by the number of days.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To convert this to gallons, we divide the number of cups by the number of cups in a gallon, which is 16.

8 cups/day ÷ 16 cups/gallon = 0.5 gallons/day

Now, we multiply the daily water consumption in gallons by the number of days to find the total water consumption in 30 days.

0.5 gallons/day * 30 days = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"To determine the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we can break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, increasing the total to 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. This results in a net increase of 50 people, bringing the total to 140 + 50 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 people descend from the train, leaving 190 - 80 = 110 people on the train.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To determine the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $\frac{48}{2} = 24$ dollars.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and multiply it by the cost of each tile.

Given that the kitchen floor has a total area of 200 SqFt and each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, we can calculate the total number of tiles required using the formula for the area of a square:

Area = side^2

Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1^2 = 1 SqFt.

To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of a single tile:

Total tiles = Total area / Area of a single tile
= 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
= 200 tiles

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile:

Total cost = Number of tiles * Cost per tile
= 200 tiles * $12/tile
= $2400

Therefore, the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor is $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To determine James' annual insurance cost, we first need to calculate the increased cost due to the accident. The normal cost is $120 per month, and it's 60% more than that. 

To find 60% of $120, we multiply $120 by 0.6, which is the decimal equivalent of 60%. This gives us $72. 

Now, we add the increased amount to the normal cost: $120 + $72 = $192. This is the increased monthly cost.

To find the annual cost, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12: $192 * 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
- 4 twin beds = 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets
- 1 king size bed = 1 king sheet
- Total sheets = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week.
- 3 sets * 1 load/set = 3 loads/week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and multiply it by 4.

Let's denote the number of movies they watch on Saturday as S. Given that they watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday, the number of movies they watch on Sunday is S/2.

We are given that S = 4. Therefore, the number of movies they watch on Sunday is 4/2 = 2.

In one weekend, the total number of movies they watch is the sum of the movies watched on Saturday and Sunday, which is S + S/2. Substituting the value of S, we get 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

To find the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies watched in one weekend by 4: 6 * 4 = 24.

"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the cumulative sum of stickers collected over the past three years.

Let's start with the initial number of stickers Leo had two years ago: 100.

Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so we add this to the initial number: 100 + 50 = 150.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers. We add this to the total from last year: 150 + 100 = 250.

Now, we calculate the total number of stickers by adding the stickers from all three years: 100 + 150 + 250 = 500.

Therefore, the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is 500.

The final answer is: $\boxed{500}$"
"To determine how many days the cat food will last, we need to calculate the total daily consumption of the cats and then divide the total amount of cat food by this value.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat eats 60 grams of cat food twice a day. Therefore, the total daily consumption of the cats is 3 cats * 120 grams/cat/day = 360 grams/day.

Now, let's divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the total daily consumption (360 grams/day): 

$$\frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2$$

"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic notation. 

Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as J, the number of slices Becky ate as B, and the number of slices Silvia ate as S. We are given the following information:

1. Each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas, so the total number of slices is 8 * 4 = 32.
2. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so B = J + 3.
3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so S = 2J.
4. Becky ate 10 slices, so B = 10.

We can substitute the value of B into the equation B = J + 3 to find the value of J:
10 = J + 3
J = 10 - 3
J = 7

Now that we have the value of J, we can find the value of S:
S = 2J
S = 2(7)
S = 14

Now, let's add up the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
Total = B + J + S
Total = 10 + 7 + 14
Total = 31

"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can express Betsy's time as x + 18.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x is the time Donovan's part took, and Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

The final answer is: 58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to break down the expenses into their respective components.

First, let's consider the cost of the cast, which is a fixed expense of $200.

Next, we have the cost of the doctor's visit. The doctor charges $300 per hour, and the visit lasted for 30 minutes. To find the cost of the visit, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is equivalent to 0.5 hours. Therefore, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is calculated by multiplying the number of pills by the cost per pill. In this case, Hannah received 30 painkillers at $4 per pill, so the total cost of the painkillers is 30 * $4 = $120.

Lastly, we have the parking expense, which is a fixed minimum of 2 hours at $6 per hour. Therefore, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add the costs together to find the total expense:

$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The final answer is: $482"
"To determine the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we first need to calculate the percentage of emails he responds to. Since 20% of his emails don't require a response, the percentage of emails he does respond to is 100% - 20% = 80%.

Now, we can calculate the number of emails James responds to per day. 80% of 80 emails is 0.8 * 80 = 64 emails.

To find the total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by 5: 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

"To calculate the average score, we need to find the arithmetic mean of the test scores. The formula for the arithmetic mean is:

Average = (Sum of scores) / (Number of scores)

Given that John scored 100 on his first 3 tests and an 80 on his 4th test, we can calculate the sum of his scores as follows:

Sum of scores = 100 + 100 + 100 + 80
Sum of scores = 380

Now, we divide the sum by the number of tests to find the average score:

Average = 380 / 4
Average = 95

Therefore, the average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.7, which is a decimal representation of 70%. This gives us 20 × 0.7 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 × 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 × 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total cost of postage for Anthony's pizza parlor coupons, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small and big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total cost for the small coupons. The number of small coupons is 700, and each costs 5 cents to mail. We can calculate this as follows:

Total cost for small coupons = Number of small coupons × Cost per small coupon
= 700 × 5 cents
= 700 × 0.05
= 35 dollars

Next, we'll find the total cost for the big coupons. Since there are twice as many big coupons as small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 × 700 = 1400. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. We can calculate this as follows:

Total cost for big coupons = Number of big coupons × Cost per big coupon
= 1400 × 15 cents
= 1400 × 0.15
= 210 dollars

Now, we can find the total cost of postage by adding the cost of small and big coupons together:

Total cost of postage = Total cost for small coupons + Total cost for big coupons
= 35 dollars + 210 dollars
= 245 dollars

The final answer is: $245"
"To determine the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. Since he ordered 3 less than ten, we can express this as:

10 - 3 = 7

This means Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the initial order is:

7 × 4 = 28

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches. To account for the additional 3 sub sandwiches Sidney ordered, we add 3 to the remaining count:

3 + 3 = 6

Now, we need to find the total number of meatballs in the 6 remaining sub sandwiches. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, we can calculate this as:

6 × 4 = 24

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we need to calculate the number of trucks that were able to complete their delivery. 

First, we find a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched, which is the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. 

Number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 20 * (1/4) = 5

Now, we subtract the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks to find the number of trucks that reached the farmers.

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = Total number of trucks - Number of trucks with mechanical failures
= 20 - 5
= 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

Total tons of fertiliser = Number of trucks that reached the farmers * Tons per truck
= 15 * 20
= 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To determine the cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion, we need to understand the pricing structure. The promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, which means for every 2 pounds of butter, the cost is $4.00 for one pound and $2.00 for the other pound.

Let's break down the cost for 6 pounds of butter into sets of 2 pounds. Since 6 pounds can be divided into 3 sets of 2 pounds, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

For 3 sets of 2 pounds of butter:
- Cost of 3 sets of 2 pounds = (3 * $4.00) + (3 * $2.00)
- Cost of 3 sets of 2 pounds = $12.00 + $6.00
- Total cost for 6 pounds of butter = $18.00

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To determine the total cost of Kayla's party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests and multiply it by the cost per guest, then add the initial fee.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Total invited guests: Kayla's classmates (25), girls in her dance class (7), and family members (13) = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45
2. Guests who could not come: 4
3. Total guests attending: 45 - 4 = 41
4. Additional guests: Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we subtract 20 from the total guests attending: 41 - 20 = 21
5. Cost per additional guest: $6
6. Cost for additional guests: 21 * 6 = $126
7. Initial fee: $125
8. Total cost: $126 + $125 = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"Given that Maggie and Riza each had $60 initially, we can calculate the amount of money they have left after spending a portion of their funds.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Maggie had as M and the initial amount Riza had as R. We know that M = R = $60.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her money left. This can be expressed as:

M - (1/4)M = (3/4)M

Since M = $60, we can substitute this value into the equation:

(3/4)M = (3/4)($60) = $45

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has 2/3 of her money left. This can be expressed as:

R - (1/3)R = (2/3)R

Since R = $60, we can substitute this value into the equation:

(2/3)R = (2/3)($60) = $40

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add the money Maggie and Riza have:

Total money left = (3/4)M + (2/3)R
= $45 + $40
= $85

The final answer is: $85"
"To determine the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, and the second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first, which is 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day. Since the total number of bananas is 315 and they last for a week (7 days), we can calculate the total number of bananas eaten each day by dividing 315 by 7: 

$$\frac{315}{7} = 45$$

Now, we can find the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day by subtracting the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten each day: 

$$45 - 24 = 21$$

Therefore, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he placed. 

Let's break it down: Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 
Then, he finished another 500-piece puzzle, which is 500 pieces. 
So, the total number of pieces he placed is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final answer is: 750"
"To determine the number of quarters Jenny leaves with after purchasing the roses, we need to calculate the total cost of the flowers and the change she receives.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses. Since 15 roses is 1 and 3 roses, it's more cost-effective to buy them by the dozen. 1 dozen roses cost $15, and 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total revenue from each item and then sum them together.

The revenue from milkshakes is calculated as the product of the number of milkshakes sold and the price per milkshake: 6 × $5.50 = $33.

The revenue from burger platters is calculated as the product of the number of platters sold and the price per platter: 9 × $11 = $99.

The revenue from sodas is calculated as the product of the number of sodas sold and the price per soda: 20 × $1.50 = $30.

Now, we add the revenues from each item together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To determine the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

Let's break down the schedule:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, let's calculate the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. We can do this by summing the time intervals between the trains:

Time waited for the first train = 10 minutes
Time waited for the second train = (60 - 30) minutes = 30 minutes
Time waited for the third train = (125 - 65) minutes = 60 minutes
Time waited for the fourth train = (145 - 125) minutes = 20 minutes

Total time waited = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes

Therefore, Paul will wait a total of 120 minutes for his train.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to calculate the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far and then find the difference between the required amount and the saved amount.

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find the total number of toothpicks she saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks saved per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the required amount to find the remaining number of toothpicks she needs:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find the number of weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week. We can do this by dividing the remaining number of toothpicks by the number of toothpicks saved per week:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, which can be expressed as a decimal by multiplying 0.75 by the original price:
$2000 \* 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which can be expressed as a decimal by multiplying 1.2 by the price he paid:
$1500 \* 1.2 = $1800

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is the difference between the original price and the price he paid:
$2000 - $1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
$\frac{200}{2000} \times 100 = 10\%$

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs and the rate at which they create jellyfish per second.

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame. 

60 \* 60 \* 4 = 14400 seconds

Since there are 5 springs, and each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

Now, we multiply the total number of seconds by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish per second:

14400 \* 5 = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"Given that Binkie's score is 90, we can express Frankie's score as a function of Binkie's score. Let's denote Binkie's score as B and Frankie's score as F. We are given that F = 2B + 15.

Substituting B = 90 into the equation, we get F = 2(90) + 15.

Using the order of operations, we first multiply 2 by 90, which gives us 180. Then, we add 15 to 180.

F = 180 + 15
F = 195

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195.

The final answer is: $\boxed{195}$"
"When solving distance-rate-time problems, it's essential to break down the scenario into manageable components. In this case, James walks to the store and then back home. The distance to the store is given as 4 miles, so the total round-trip distance is 2 * 4 = 8 miles.

To find the time it took James to walk this distance, we can use the formula: time = distance / rate. In this case, the rate is 4 miles per hour, and the distance is 8 miles. Plugging in the values, we get:

time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour

Simplifying the expression, we get:

time = 2 hours

Therefore, the time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the cost of each approach.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas purchased: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost would be: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Given that Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam, we can model this situation using a linear equation.

Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet. The total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

Therefore, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the rate at which the crocodile grows per year, we can use the formula:

Growth per year = Total growth / Number of years

Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can calculate the growth rate as follows:

Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth per year = 2 inches/year

Now, to find the total growth in 13 years, we can multiply the growth per year by the number of years:

Total growth in 13 years = Growth per year * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To determine Marcel's total earnings from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the number of hay bales left in the field after a 6-hour workday. We have two entities involved: the farmer, who produces 5 bales per hour, and the truck, which picks up 3 bales per hour.

To find the total number of bales produced by the farmer, we multiply the hourly production rate by the number of hours worked: 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales.

Next, we calculate the total number of bales picked up by the truck: 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales.

Now, to determine the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the total number of bales produced: 30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales.

Therefore, the number of hay bales left in the field after a 6-hour workday is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the total minutes spent in class and the additional minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's find the total minutes spent in class. John has 6 regular periods and 2 extra classes, each lasting 40 minutes. The total minutes spent in class per day is 6 * 40 + 2 * 40 = 240 + 80 = 320 minutes. Since John attends classes 5 days a week, the total minutes spent in class per week is 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes.

Next, we need to find the total minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. The total minutes in a week is 7 * 24 * 60 = 1680 minutes. Therefore, the total minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday is 1/16 * 1680 = 105 minutes.

Now, let's add the minutes spent in class and the additional minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday: 1600 + 105 = 1705 minutes.

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 1705 / 60 = 28.42 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28.42}$"
"To determine the height of the bouncy ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after each bounce. 

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

The height of the ball after the first bounce is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

The height of the ball after the second bounce is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the height of the ball on its second bounce is 32 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we need to convert the height of the first child from feet to inches and then calculate the height of each child step by step.

First, we convert the height of the first child from feet to inches: 6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches.

Now, we calculate the height of the second child, which is two inches taller than the first child: 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

Next, we calculate the height of the third child, which is 5 inches shorter than the second child: 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

Finally, we calculate the height of the fourth child, which is three inches taller than the third child: 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the total earnings of the apple orchard, we need to calculate the number of bags sold and then multiply it by the price per bag. 

First, we divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the number of bags sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200

Now, we multiply the number of bags sold (200) by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 × $5 = $1000

Therefore, the total earnings of the apple orchard for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag is $1000.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms left after the Allosaurus ate. Let's denote the original weight of the triceratops as x.

The Allosaurus ate half of what the velociraptors had, so the velociraptors had 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex, the T-Rex must have eaten half of the original weight of the triceratops. This means the T-Rex ate (1/2)x, and the velociraptors had (1/2)(1/2)x = (1/4)x.

We know the velociraptors had 540 kilograms, which is equal to (1/4)x. To find x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

(1/4)x = 540
x = 540 * 4
x = 2160

Therefore, the original weight of the triceratops was 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2160}$"
"To determine the cost of painting the room, we must first calculate the total area of the walls. The north and south walls are 10 feet in width and 8 feet in height, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. The east and west walls are 5 feet in width and 8 feet in height, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.

The total area of the room is the sum of the areas of the four walls, which is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"Given the scenario, we can model this as a problem of conditional probability. Initially, there are 12 sodas, with 3 shaken and 9 unshaken. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken. Her brother then takes 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, resulting in 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

To find the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the probability of her choosing a shaken can given the remaining sodas. This is a conditional probability problem, and we can use the formula:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

However, in this case, we can simplify the problem by considering the total number of cans and the number of shaken cans. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Let's denote the number of shaken cans as S and the total number of cans as T. Initially, S = 3 and T = 12. After Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, S = 3 and T = 11. After her brother takes 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, S = 2 and T = 7.

The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is:

P(shaken) = S / T
= 2 / 7
= 2/7

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

P(shaken) = (2/7) * 100
= 28.57%

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 28.57%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28.57}$"
"When dealing with relative motion problems, it's essential to consider the concept of relative speed. In this scenario, we have two trains moving in opposite directions. To find the total distance between them, we need to calculate the combined distance each train has traveled.

Let's denote the speed of the first train as 60 miles per hour and the speed of the second train as 30 miles per hour (since it's traveling half the speed of the first train).

The formula to find the distance traveled is Distance = Speed × Time. Since both trains are traveling for the same amount of time (3 hours), we can calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add them together.

Distance traveled by the first train = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled by the second train = 30 miles/hour × 3 hours = 90 miles

The total distance between the two trains is the sum of the distances they've traveled: 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the total number of people Billy helps, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to work between March 1st and April 19th.

First, let's find the total number of days in the given period. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. Therefore, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. This can be calculated as 0.2 * 50 = 10.

Now, subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy helps: 50 - 10 = 40.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

To find the total number of people Billy helps, we multiply the number of days he is available to work by the number of people he can help per day: 40 * 6 = 240.

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people that were present. However, the problem statement does not provide the total number of people present. 

Let's assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported, which is a reasonable assumption given the context of the problem. 

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since we are assuming that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported, the number of people inside the church is equal to the number of people transported:
480 people

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the ages of Jeff, Martha, and Mike.

Let's denote Jeff's age as J, Martha's age as M, and Mike's age as K.

We are given the following information:

1. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha: J = M + 10
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike: M = K - 4
3. Mike is 24 years old: K = 24

We can substitute the value of K into the second equation to find Martha's age:

M = K - 4
M = 24 - 4
M = 20

Now that we have Martha's age, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find Jeff's age:

J = M + 10
J = 20 + 10
J = 30

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

The final answer is: 30"
"When analyzing the time it takes to ride each waterslide, we must consider the relationship between the length of the slide and the speed at which individuals slide down. The time it takes to ride a slide is inversely proportional to its speed. 

For the biggest waterslide, which is 300 feet long and has a speed of 60 feet/minute, we can calculate the time it takes to ride as follows:

time = length / speed = 300 / 60 = 5 minutes

For the second biggest waterslide, which is 240 feet long and has a speed of 80 feet/minute, we can calculate the time it takes to ride as follows:

time = length / speed = 240 / 80 = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time between the two slides, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide:

time difference = time for biggest slide - time for second biggest slide = 5 - 3 = 2 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total time spent on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. The total time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes. 

The total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of miles Ahito ran, we need to calculate the total miles run by Micah. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can express this relationship as a multiplication problem.

Micah's miles = 8 × 3.5

Using the distributive property of multiplication, we can rewrite this expression as:

Micah's miles = 8 × (3 + 0.5)
Micah's miles = (8 × 3) + (8 × 0.5)
Micah's miles = 24 + 4
Micah's miles = 28

Now, we can find the number of miles Ahito ran by subtracting the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item and then add that to the initial charge.

First, let's calculate the new balance after the return:

Initial charge: $85.00
Return: -$15.00
New balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the frying pan, which is on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (20% = 0.20):

Discount: 0.20 × $20.00 = $4.00
Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the towels, which are 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (10% = 0.10):

Discount: 0.10 × $30.00 = $3.00
Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

The total cost of the new purchases is the sum of the frying pan and the towels:

Total cost of new purchases: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Finally, we add the total cost of the new purchases to the new balance after the return:

New balance: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Given the problem, let's analyze the situation. We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so x/15 = 6. To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x:

$$\frac{x}{15} = 6$$

Multiplying both sides by 15 to isolate x:

$$x = 6 \times 15$$

$$x = 90$$

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a series of linear equations to represent the relationships between the ages of Caroline, Ben, and Chris.

Let C represent Caroline's age, B represent Ben's age, and Ch represent Chris's age. We are given the following information:

1. Caroline is three times older than Ben: C = 3B
2. Ben is two times older than Chris: B = 2Ch
3. Chris is 4 years old: Ch = 4

We can substitute the value of Ch into the second equation to find Ben's age:
B = 2(4)
B = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find Caroline's age:
C = 3B
C = 3(8)
C = 24

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the number of years Lauren needs to work to save for retirement, we must first calculate the total amount she needs to save. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary of $100,000 in retirement, her annual retirement income will be:

$$
\text{Annual retirement income} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
$$

Given that she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:

$$
\text{Total savings needed} = \text{Annual retirement income} \times \text{Number of years in retirement} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
$$

Now, we can calculate the number of years it will take her to save this amount at a rate of 20% of her annual salary, which is $20,000 per year:

$$
\text{Number of years} = \frac{\text{Total savings needed}}{\text{Annual savings}} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
$$

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save for her retirement.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the length of each final cut, we must first divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into. In this case, Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. This can be expressed as a division problem: 100 cm ÷ 4 = 25 cm.

Next, we need to divide each of these 4 equal parts into 5 equal parts. This can be expressed as another division problem: 25 cm ÷ 5 = 5 cm.

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the given information that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. 

First, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40% = 40/100 = 0.4

Now, we can set up an equation to find the total number of students: 0.4x = 240, where x is the total number of students.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.4: x = 240 / 0.4

x = 600

This means the total number of students in the school is 600. 

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we can multiply the total number of students by the decimal equivalent of 60%: 0.6 * 600 = 360

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"To determine the total amount spent at the gardening shop, we need to apply the principles of arithmetic operations. 

First, we add the cost of the pots and the garden soil: $19 + $26 = $45.

Next, we apply the discount of $7 to the total cost: $45 - $7 = $38.

Therefore, the total amount spent at the gardening shop is $38.

The final answer is: $38"
"To calculate the average height of heels at the party, we need to find the total height of all the heels and divide it by the total number of women.

Let's denote the number of women wearing 4 inch heels as n1 = 3 and the number of women wearing 2 inch heels as n2 = 3.

The total height of the 4 inch heels is given by 4n1 = 4 * 3 = 12 inches.
The total height of the 2 inch heels is given by 2n2 = 2 * 3 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is the sum of the heights of the 4 inch and 2 inch heels: 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

The average height of heels is the total height divided by the total number of women, which is n1 + n2 = 3 + 3 = 6. Therefore, the average height of heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles per day: 9,300 ÷ 250 = 37.2 days.

Since Soledad only has 30 days in June, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we need to calculate the total miles she can hike in 30 days at 250 miles per day: 250 * 30 = 7,500 miles.

The difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the miles she can hike in 30 days is 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the difference by the number of days: 1,800 ÷ 30 = 60 miles per day.

The final answer is: 60"

"To determine the amount of money Raymond has left, we need to apply the principles of arithmetic operations, specifically addition and subtraction.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Raymond initially had $21.
2. He saved $11 from his allowance, so we add this amount to his initial amount: $21 + $11 = $32.
3. Next, he spent $5 on a comic book, so we subtract this amount from his current total: $32 - $5 = $27.
4. Finally, he spent $19 on a puzzle, so we subtract this amount from his current total: $27 - $19 = $8.

Therefore, the correct answer is $8."
"To determine the cost of each book, we need to calculate the total amount spent on the books. 

Anna initially had a budget of $16 and spent $4, leaving her with $16 - $4 = $12. After purchasing the 2 books, she had $2 remaining, indicating that she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2.

$$\frac{\$10}{2} = \$5$$

Therefore, each book cost $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"To determine the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year, we need to calculate the 20% increase in enrollment from last year.

The formula for calculating the increase is: Increase = (Percentage Increase / 100) * Previous Year's Enrollment

Given that the percentage increase is 20% and the previous year's enrollment was 50 students, we can plug in the values:

Increase = (20 / 100) * 50
Increase = 0.20 * 50
Increase = 10 students

Now, we add the increase to the previous year's enrollment to find the current year's enrollment:

Current Year's Enrollment = Previous Year's Enrollment + Increase
Current Year's Enrollment = 50 + 10
Current Year's Enrollment = 60 students

Therefore, the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year is 60."
"Given the lighthouse's blinking rate, we can establish a proportion to determine the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times. 

Let's denote the time it takes for the light to blink 255 times as 5 minutes. We can set up a proportion to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times:

(255 blinks) / 5 minutes = (459 blinks) / x minutes

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and simplify the equation:

255x = 459 * 5

Now, we can solve for x:

255x = 2295

x = 2295 / 255

x = 9

Therefore, the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times is 9 minutes.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the difference between the number of female and male fishes in Tate's garden pond, we need to calculate the total number of each sex.

Let's start by calculating the total number of male fishes. We have 4 male guppies and 3 male goldfishes initially, and Tate buys 2 more male guppies and 2 male goldfishes. The total number of male fishes is the sum of these quantities:

Total male fishes = 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 11

Next, we calculate the total number of female fishes. We have 7 female guppies and 5 female goldfishes initially, and Tate buys 1 more female guppy and 3 female goldfishes. The total number of female fishes is the sum of these quantities:

Total female fishes = 7 + 5 + 1 + 3 = 16

Now, we can find the difference between the number of female and male fishes by subtracting the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:

Difference = Total female fishes - Total male fishes = 16 - 11 = 5

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time taken by each person to complete their chores and then add them together.

Let's start by identifying the time taken by Amalia, which is given as 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so we can express Megan's time as 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia, so we can express Dior's time as 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we can find the total time they all took to do their chores by adding their individual times together: 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores is 18 hours.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the total distance John drives in a month, we need to calculate the distance of a round trip and then multiply it by the number of times he visits his parents in a month.

First, let's calculate the distance of a one-way trip using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time.

Given that John drives at a speed of 70 miles per hour and it takes him 2 hours to drive to his parents, we can calculate the one-way distance as follows:

Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2 to get the total round-trip distance:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

Now, we need to determine how many miles John drives in a month. We are given that he visits his parents twice a month. Therefore, we multiply the total round-trip distance by 2:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{560}$"
"To determine the distance Brian will walk in 7 days, we first need to calculate the total distance Sofie will cover in the same timeframe. Given that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate this by multiplying the daily distance by the number of days: 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles.

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can infer that Brian's distance will be half of Sofie's total distance. Therefore, we divide Sofie's total distance by 2 to find Brian's distance: 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the production rate of the fifth worker, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the four workers in 10 hours. 

The two workers producing 6 toys per hour will produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The other two workers producing 4 toys per hour will produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 
The combined production rate of these four workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour. 
In 10 hours, they will produce 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to fulfill the order, the total number of toys required is 400 + 20 = 420. 
The fifth worker must have produced the remaining 420 - 200 = 220 toys in 10 hours. 
To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the total number of toys produced by the number of hours worked: 220 / 10 = 22 toys per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog, we need to calculate the weight of each dog and add them together.

Let's start by finding the weight of Elijah's first dog, which is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, we can express this as a fraction: 60/4. To find the weight of Elijah's first dog, we divide 60 by 4.

60 ÷ 4 = 15

So, Elijah's first dog weighs 15 pounds.

Next, we find the weight of Elijah's second dog, which is half the weight of Kory's dog. We can express this as a fraction: 60/2. To find the weight of Elijah's second dog, we divide 60 by 2.

60 ÷ 2 = 30

So, Elijah's second dog weighs 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weight of Elijah's dogs to the weight of Kory's dog: 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of stickers Seth had as S.

From the information given, we know that Luis received half of Seth's stickers. Therefore, Luis had S/2 stickers.

Kris received half of Luis's stickers, which is (S/2)/2 = S/4 stickers.

We also know that Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. This means that Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers in total.

Since Kris had S/4 stickers, we can set up the equation S/4 = 16 to find the initial number of stickers Seth had.

S/4 = 16

To solve for S, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

S = 16 * 4
S = 64

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is: 64"
"To determine the total number of small bags John can make, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's and then divide by the number of M&M's per small bag.

First, we need to convert the weight of the large bags from ounces to a more manageable unit. Since we know that 1 ounce is equivalent to 16 units of 1/16 (or 16 drams), we can convert 10 ounces to drams for easier calculation.

10 ounces * 16 drams/ounce = 160 drams

However, since we are given the information that an ounce of M&M's contains 30 M&M's, we can directly use the ounce as the unit for our calculation. 

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Since each small bag contains 10 M&M's, we can divide the total number of M&M's by 10 to find the number of small bags.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to calculate half of the circumference of the earth. The circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. 

Half of the circumference of the earth is calculated as follows:

Circumference of the earth = 40,000 km
Half of the circumference = (1/2) × 40,000 km = 20,000 km

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 km at a speed of 400 km/day.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is: 50"
"Given that the average car can travel at 120 miles per hour, and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can express the speed of the 2nd fastest car as 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

Now, we are told that the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the faster car, we can multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25:

Speed of the faster car = 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

Therefore, the speed of the faster car is 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"Let's denote Liam's current age as L and Vince's current age as V. We are given that L = 16. Two years ago, Liam's age was L - 2, and Vince's age was V - 2. According to the problem, L - 2 = 2(V - 2).

We can now solve for V by simplifying the equation:

L - 2 = 2V - 4
L = 2V - 2
16 = 2V - 2
2V = 16 + 2
2V = 18
V = 18/2
V = 9

Therefore, Vince's current age is 9 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"Given that Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 Easter eggs, we can denote the number of eggs painted by each individual as follows:

Let A be the number of eggs painted by Arnold, M be the number of eggs painted by Madeline, C be the number of eggs painted by Camden, and S be the number of eggs painted by Sarah.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we can express this as A = M.

We are also given that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, which can be represented as C + S = 30.

Furthermore, it is stated that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so we can express this as C = S + 12.

To find the number of eggs painted by each individual, we can start by solving the system of equations. We can substitute the expression C = S + 12 into the equation C + S = 30 to get:

S + 12 + S = 30

Combine like terms:

2S + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2S = 18

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 9

Now that we know the number of eggs painted by Sarah, we can find the number of eggs painted by Camden by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12:

C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we can express the total number of eggs as A + M + C + S = 56. Substituting the values of A, M, C, and S, we get:

A + A + 21 + 9 = 56

Combine like terms:

2A + 30 = 56

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2A = 26

Divide both sides by 2:

A = 13

Now that we know the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Camden, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold:

C - A = 21 - 13
C - A = 8

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the total weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So the total weight of the crayons is 200 × 1 = 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 200 crayons, we need to find out how many boxes he will need. To do this, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 ÷ 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, we can find the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 25 × 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 ÷ 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total amount John makes from selling the planks, we first need to calculate the number of logs he can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Next, we divide the total feet of usable wood by the length of each log to find the number of logs.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5 to find the total number of planks.

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Now, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank to find the total amount John makes.

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother. Let's denote Valerie's monthly salary as V, her brother's monthly salary as B, and their mother's monthly salary as M.

We are given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. This can be expressed as:

V = 1/2 B

We can rewrite this equation to solve for B:

B = 2V
B = 2 * $5000
B = $10,000

Now that we know Valerie's brother earns $10,000 per month, we can find their combined salary:

V + B = $5000 + $10,000
V + B = $15,000

We are also given that their mother earns twice their combined salary:

M = 2(V + B)
M = 2 * $15,000
M = $30,000

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries:

Total = V + B + M
Total = $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000
Total = $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to apply the concept of unit rates and time-distance-speed relationships. Let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time spent on the beach can be calculated using the formula: time = distance/speed. In this case, the time spent on the beach is 2/x minutes.

Given that the time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, we can set up the equation: 2/x = 40. Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

To find the time spent on the sidewalk, we use the formula: time = distance/speed. The distance is 1 mile and the speed is 1/10 miles per minute. So, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of additional weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal, we first calculate the total amount she has saved so far. Since she saves $4 per week for 8 weeks, we can use the formula for the total amount saved:

Total Amount Saved = Weekly Savings × Number of Weeks
Total Amount Saved = $4/week × 8 weeks
Total Amount Saved = $32

Next, we need to find the remaining amount she needs to save to reach her goal of $60:

Remaining Amount = Goal Amount - Total Amount Saved
Remaining Amount = $60 - $32
Remaining Amount = $28

Now, we can calculate the number of additional weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

Additional Weeks = Remaining Amount ÷ Weekly Savings
Additional Weeks = $28 ÷ $4/week
Additional Weeks = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then sum them up.

First, let's consider the 3 trees with 7 blue birds each. The number of blue birds in these trees is 3 × 7 = 21.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each. The number of blue birds in these trees is 2 × 4 = 8.

Lastly, there is 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

To find the total number of blue birds, we add the number of blue birds in each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic equations.

Let x be the initial number of marbles Bob has. According to the problem, if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 × 12 = 24. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 24 = 60

To find the initial number of marbles Bob has, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

Now that we know Bob has 36 marbles initially, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from 36:

x - 10 = 36 - 10
x - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles if he loses 10 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"Given the scenario, we can model the problem using a linear equation. Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces.

We can express this as:

(33 + x) / 2 * 5 ≥ 40

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides of the inequality by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

(33 + x) * 5 ≥ 80

Next, we can distribute the 5 to the terms inside the parentheses:

165 + 5x ≥ 80

Subtracting 165 from both sides of the inequality gives us:

5x ≥ -85

Dividing both sides of the inequality by 5 yields:

x ≥ -17

However, since the temperature cannot be negative, we need to find the minimum value of x that satisfies the condition. In this case, the minimum value of x is the point at which the inequality becomes an equality. Therefore, we can set the inequality to an equation and solve for x:

5x = -85

x = -85 / 5

x = -17

However, since x represents a temperature, it must be a non-negative value. Therefore, we need to find the minimum value of x that satisfies the condition. In this case, the minimum value of x is the point at which the inequality becomes an equality. Since x cannot be negative, the minimum value of x is 40 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. The number of cows added in three weeks can be calculated as follows:

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days
= 20 * 21
= 420 cows

Now, let's add the initial number of cows to the number of cows added in three weeks:

Total number of cows = 50 cows + 420 cows
= 470 cows

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. The number of chickens added in three weeks can be calculated as follows:

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days
= 10 * 21
= 210 chickens

Now, let's add the initial number of chickens to the number of chickens added in three weeks:

Total number of chickens = 20 chickens + 210 chickens
= 230 chickens

Finally, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks:

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

The final answer is: 700"
"When calculating the cost per bagel after a discount, it's essential to consider the total cost of the bagels and the number of bagels purchased. In this case, Russell orders 4 packs of bagels, each containing 9 bagels. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the bagels before the discount. Since each pack costs $10.00, the total cost is 4 packs * $10.00 = $40.00.

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. To find 10% of $40.00, we multiply $40.00 by 0.10, which equals $4.00. Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives us the discounted cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we need to find the cost per bagel. To do this, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and Russell ordered 4 packs, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36.

The cost per bagel is calculated as follows: $36.00 ÷ 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We are given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be represented as:

Gomer's scoops = 23 - 5

Simplifying the expression, we get:

Gomer's scoops = 18

Now, we are told that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be represented as:

Potatoes per 2 scoops = 6 - 3

Simplifying the expression, we get:

Potatoes per 2 scoops = 3

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, we can find the number of potatoes per scoop by dividing both sides by 2:

Potatoes per scoop = 3/2

Now, we can find the total number of potatoes Gomer ate by multiplying the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:

Total potatoes = Gomer's scoops * Potatoes per scoop
= 18 * (3/2)
= 18 * 3 / 2
= 54 / 2
= 27

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. This can be calculated as follows:

3 eggs/day * 30 days = 3 * 30 = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. This can be calculated as follows:

5 eggs/day * 30 days = 5 * 30 = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 90 + 150 = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

240 eggs / 12 = 240/12 = 20

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic arithmetic operations and logical reasoning. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. This means the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Next, we need to find the total number of green and red jellybeans. This is simply the sum of the number of green and red jellybeans: 17 + 34 = 51.

Now, we are given that the total number of jellybeans is 60. To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans: 60 - 51 = 9.

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

First, let's find the total number of lemons he gets in a year. Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree yields 6 lemons, we can express this as a simple multiplication problem:

5 trees × 6 lemons/tree = 5 × 6 = 30 lemons/year

Now, to find the total number of lemons in a decade, we multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10:

30 lemons/year × 10 years = 30 × 10 = 300 lemons

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"Given the ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9, we can express the total number of passengers as a sum of the parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 9 = 14. 

The fraction of women on the bus is 9/14. To find the number of women on the bus, we multiply this fraction by the total number of passengers: 

$$\frac{9}{14} \times 84 = \frac{9 \times 84}{14} = \frac{756}{14} = 54.$$

Now, we need to find the number of women who remained on the bus after 20 women alighted. This is given by subtracting the number of women who alighted from the initial number of women: 

$$54 - 20 = 34.$$

Therefore, the number of women who remained on the bus is 34.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We are given that Faraday sells sunflowers for $2 each and bouquets of sunflowers for $8 each, with each bouquet containing 12 sunflowers. We also know that he earns $26 from the sunflowers and $56 from the bouquets per day.

Let's denote the number of sunflowers sold per day as S and the number of bouquets sold per day as B. We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:

2S + 8B = 26  ... (Equation 1)  (Total earnings from sunflowers and bouquets per day)
12B = S  ... (Equation 2)  (Number of sunflowers in each bouquet)

We can solve Equation 2 for S in terms of B:

S = 12B

Now, substitute this expression for S into Equation 1:

2(12B) + 8B = 26

Simplify the equation:

24B + 8B = 26

Combine like terms:

32B = 26

Divide both sides by 32:

B = 26/32

B = 13/16

Now that we have the value of B, we can find the value of S by substituting B into the expression S = 12B:

S = 12(13/16)

S = 156/16

S = 39/4

Now that we have the values of B and S, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day:

Total sunflowers per day = S + (number of sunflowers in B bouquets)
= 39/4 + 12B
= 39/4 + 12(13/16)
= 39/4 + 156/16
= (39*4 + 156)/16
= (156 + 156)/16
= 312/16
= 39/2

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days by multiplying the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:

Total sunflowers in 3 days = (39/2) * 3
= 117/2
= 58.5

The final answer is: 58.5"
"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100 investment. Since each rock costs $5, we can calculate the number of rocks as follows:

Number of rocks = Total investment / Cost per rock
= $100 / $5
= 20 rocks

Next, we need to find out how many rocks Adam sells. Since he sells 60% of his inventory, we can calculate the number of rocks sold as follows:

Number of rocks sold = 60% of 20 rocks
= 0.6 × 20
= 12 rocks

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each:

Revenue = Number of rocks sold × Price per rock
= 12 rocks × $7/rock
= $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:

Cost = Number of rocks × Cost per rock
= 20 rocks × $5/rock
= $100

However, since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

Cost of unsold rocks = Number of unsold rocks × Cost per rock
= 8 rocks × $5/rock
= $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

Total cost = Cost + Cost of unsold rocks
= $100 + $40
= $140

To find out how much money Adam loses, we subtract the revenue from the total cost:

Loss = Total cost - Revenue
= $140 - $84
= $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To determine the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days it will take her to complete each type of picture scene and then find the maximum of these values.

Let's start by calculating the number of days it will take Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

1. For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 45/5 = 9 days
2. For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 36/6 = 6 days
3. For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 49/7 = 7 days

Now, we need to find the maximum of these values to determine the minimum number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project. The maximum of 9, 6, and 7 is 9.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project.

The final answer is: 9"

"To determine the total cost of food for Jen's fish in May, we need to calculate the daily expenditure and then multiply it by the number of days in the month.

First, we establish the daily cost of food for the fish. Since each fish requires $1 worth of food per day and Jen has 3 fish, the total daily cost is 3 \* $1 = $3.

Next, we need to find the total number of days in May. May has 31 days.

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the month by multiplying the daily cost by the number of days: $3 \* 31 = $93.

Therefore, the total cost of food for Jen's fish in May is $93.

The final answer is: $93"
"To determine the current number of roses Patricia has, we need to apply the principles of arithmetic operations. 

First, we subtract the number of roses she gave away from the initial number of roses: 30 - 24 = 6.

"To determine the average speed of Sid's journey, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances covered in the two segments of the journey. 

Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles
Total distance = 250 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the times taken for the two segments of the journey.

Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours
Total time = 5 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour

Therefore, the average speed of Sid's journey is 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 50"
"When considering the probability of both tickets winning, we must first understand the individual probabilities of each ticket. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which translates to a probability of 0.2 in decimal form. The second ticket, being three times more likely to win, has a probability of 3 \* 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we apply the principle of independence in probability theory. When events are independent, the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. Therefore, the probability of both tickets winning is 0.2 \* 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 \* 100 = 12%.

In probability theory, this is an example of the multiplication rule for independent events. The final answer is 12%."
"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic equations.

Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carrey as R, Carlos as C, and Jim as J.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. J = C + 5 (Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos)
2. C = 2R (Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey)
3. J = 27 (Jim collected 27 seashells)

We can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to get:
J = 2R + 5

Now, we can substitute J = 27 into the equation:
27 = 2R + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us:
22 = 2R

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:
R = 11

Now that we know R, we can find C using equation (2):
C = 2R
C = 2(11)
C = 22

Now that we know C and R, we can find J using equation (1):
J = C + 5
J = 22 + 5
J = 27

We have confirmed that our values for R, C, and J are consistent with the given information.

The total number of seashells collected is R + C + J = 11 + 22 + 27 = 60.

To find out how many seashells each person gets when they divide the total number of seashells equally among themselves, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3:
60 / 3 = 20

"To determine the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he consumes on weekdays and add the number he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). This can be represented as 4 * 5 = 20 carrots.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. Therefore, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend: 20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30.

"To determine the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song. Given that it is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes, we can express this as an equation:

Let x be the length of the second song. Then, x = 5 + 0.6(5)

To find the value of x, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is 60% as a decimal) and add the result to 5.

x = 5 + 0.6(5)
x = 5 + 3
x = 8

Now that we have the length of the second song, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs.

Total time = 5 + 8
Total time = 13 minutes

"To calculate the total profit, we need to determine the profit from each day and then add them together.

Let's start by calculating the profit from Monday. The cost price for 2 devices is 2 * $20 = $40. Since Linus sells each device for twice the amount of the original price, the selling price for each device is 2 * $20 = $40. Therefore, the total selling price for Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit for Monday is the difference between the total selling price and the cost price, which is $80 - $40 = $40.

Next, we'll calculate the profit from Tuesday. The cost price for 4 devices is 4 * $20 = $80. Since Linus sells each device for twice the amount of the original price, the selling price for each device is 2 * $20 = $40. Therefore, the total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit for Tuesday is the difference between the total selling price and the cost price, which is $160 - $80 = $80.

To find the total profit, we add the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we need to establish the height of each individual involved. 

Given that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Now, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, we can calculate the length of Carl's cane as follows:

Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

"To determine the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the number of bottles required to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand.

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we can find the number of bottles needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand by dividing 100% by 20%, which is equivalent to dividing 1 by 0.20. This can be expressed as:

1 ÷ 0.20 = 5

Now, to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we multiply the number of bottles needed for one person by 2300:

5 × 2300 = 11,500

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find the difference between the required production and the current production:

11,500 - 4,200 = 7,300

Therefore, Hortex needs to produce 7,300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To determine the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to calculate the conditional probability of the event. Let's break it down step by step.

Let P(P) be the probability of a baby wearing purple, P(B) be the probability of a baby wearing a bow, and P(P ∩ B) be the probability of a baby wearing both purple and a bow.

We know that 3/4 of the babies wear purple, so P(P) = 3/4. We also know that 1/4 of the babies wear blue, so P(¬P) = 1/4, where ¬P represents the complement of event P (i.e., not wearing purple).

We are given that 1/3 of the purple-wearers also wear bows. Therefore, the probability of a baby wearing purple and a bow is P(P ∩ B) = 1/3 * P(P) = 1/3 * 3/4 = 1/4.

Now, we need to find the probability of a baby wearing a bow, P(B). We know that P(B) = P(P ∩ B) + P(¬P ∩ B), where P(¬P ∩ B) is the probability of a baby wearing a bow but not purple. Since 1/4 of the babies wear blue, and 1/3 of the purple-wearers wear bows, we can assume that 1/3 of the blue-wearers also wear bows. Therefore, P(¬P ∩ B) = 1/3 * 1/4 = 1/12.

Now we can calculate P(B) = P(P ∩ B) + P(¬P ∩ B) = 1/4 + 1/12 = 5/12.

Finally, we can find the conditional probability P(B|P) that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:

P(B|P) = P(P ∩ B) / P(B) = (1/4) / (5/12) = 3/5

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(3/5) * 100 = 60%

Therefore, the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 60%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the number of tax reports received on Wednesday, we need to isolate the reports received on that day. We can do this by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtracting that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Let's denote the total number of reports received last week as T, the reports received on Monday and Tuesday as M, and the reports received on Thursday and Friday as F. We are given that T = 5168, M = 1907, and F = 2136.

We can now calculate the number of reports received on Wednesday (W) as follows:

W = T - (M + F)
W = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
W = 5168 - 4043
W = 1125

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To determine the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's calculate the amount of land sold in the first two transactions. Abraham owns 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50. Since half of 80 is 40, we can express this as:

$$\frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40$$

So, he sold 40 square meters of land for $50.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since 1/4 of 80 is 20, we can express this as:

$$\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20$$

So, he sold 20 square meters of land for $30.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is:

$$20 \times 3 = 60$$

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale.

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To determine Geb's age, we can express the relationship between Geb's and Haley's ages using an algebraic equation. Let's denote Geb's age as G and Haley's age as H.

Given that Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, we can write the equation as:

G = (1/2)H - 10

We are also given that Haley is 26 years old. Substituting H = 26 into the equation, we get:

G = (1/2)(26) - 10

To solve for G, we can simplify the expression:

G = 13 - 10

G = 3

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the total number of face masks he uses in a day and then multiply it by 2.

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find the total number of face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2.

6 * 2 = 12

Therefore, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs hidden.

Let's start by calculating the number of eggs found by each person:

- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found by all the people: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we need to calculate the total number of apartments and then multiply it by the number of collections per week and the payment per collection.

First, let's find the size of the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 2 * 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, which can be expressed as 400 + 60% of 400.

To find 60% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.6, which gives us 400 * 0.6 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives us 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we have a total of 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits. 

In the next year, the tree is 6 years old, so it produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.

The following year, the tree is 7 years old, so it produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.

Now, we are given that an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let's call the production of a 10-year-old tree 'x'. Then, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.

The tree does not produce any fruits in the 9th year, so we can skip that year.

In the 10th year, the tree is 10 years old, and it produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we need to find the value of 'x', which is the production of a 10-year-old tree. We know that the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200, and we also know that the production of a 10-year-old tree is 1000 fruits. Since the production of a 10-year-old tree is 20 times the initial amount of fruits, we can set up the equation x = 20 * 50 = 1000.

Now that we know the production of a 10-year-old tree, we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

The final answer is: 2350"
"To determine the amount of money Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

The fraction 1/5 can be expressed as a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 1 ÷ 5 = 0.2. Multiplying this decimal by Sophia's $100 gives us the amount she gave to Jack: 0.2 × $100 = $20.

Now, we add this amount to Jack's initial $100: $100 + $20 = $120.

Therefore, Jack now has $120."
"Given the problem, we can establish a system of linear equations to solve for the length of the red rope. Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R.

We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7. 

We also know that R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic equations.

Let's denote the amount of money Ronnie was given as 'R' and the amount of money Rissa was given as '3R' since she received thrice as much as Ronnie.

We are given that after each of them gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money. This can be represented as:

(3R - x) = (4/5)(3R)

where 'x' is the amount of money given to their little sister.

Simplifying the equation:

3R - x = (12/5)R

To isolate 'x', we can subtract 3R from both sides of the equation:

-x = (12/5)R - 3R

Combine like terms:

-x = (-3/5)R

Multiply both sides by -1 to solve for 'x':

x = (3/5)R

Now, we know that Ronnie was given $5, so we can substitute R = 5 into the equation:

x = (3/5)(5)
x = 3

This means that Ronnie gave $3 to their little sister. To find out how much money Ronnie is left with, we subtract x from the original amount:

R - x = 5 - 3
= 2

The final answer is: $2"
"Given that the wall mural has four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are three colors with equal amounts, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

We are also given that half the mural is yellow, which means the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the other half is 6 pints (12 / 2 = 6). This 6 pints is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: 

$$\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{6}{3}$$

x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total area of Tom's house, we must first calculate the area of each component and then sum them.

The area of a rectangle, such as a bedroom, is given by the product of its length and width. In this case, each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so its area is $A_{\text{bedroom}} = 20 \times 12 = 240$ square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is $A_{\text{bedrooms}} = 4 \times A_{\text{bedroom}} = 4 \times 240 = 960$ square feet.

The living room is 5 times larger than a bedroom, so its area is $A_{\text{living room}} = 5 \times A_{\text{bedroom}} = 5 \times 240 = 1200$ square feet.

The remaining area of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we sum the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area: $A_{\text{total}} = A_{\text{bedrooms}} + A_{\text{living room}} + A_{\text{remaining}} = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160$ square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3160}$"
"The problem at hand is a classic example of a geometric progression, where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed constant, in this case, 2. The sequence of the number of clouds Alice counts each day is as follows:

3, 6, 12, 24, 48

To find the sum of this geometric series, we can use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 3, r = 2, and n = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
= 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1)
= 3 * (-31) / (-1)
= 93

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice counts across all five days is 93.

The final answer is: 93"
"To determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box for $1, we first need to calculate the number of pods in the new box. The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, which contains 100 pods. 

To find 20% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.2, which gives us 20. Therefore, the new box contains 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles can be run with the new box for $12. Since each cycle requires one pod, the number of cycles is equal to the number of pods in the new box, which is 120.

To find out how many cycles can be run for $1, we divide the total number of cycles by 12.

$$\frac{120}{12} = 10$$

Therefore, the new box can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

Next, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

He triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

To find the number of 5 dollar bills he has, we simply need to count the number of bills, which is 60.

The final numerical answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, let's break down the information given.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by team A in the first half as A1 and the number of goals scored by team B in the first half as B1. We are given that A1 = 4 and B1 = A1 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so B2 = 4 * B1 = 4 * 2 = 8. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, so A2 = (1/4) * B2 = (1/4) * 8 = 2.

The total number of goals scored by team A is A1 + A2 = 4 + 2 = 6. The total number of goals scored by team B is B1 + B2 = 2 + 8 = 10.

The total number of goals scored in the match is A1 + A2 + B1 + B2 = 4 + 2 + 2 + 8 = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how many days he can use the remaining chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Initially, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, so the remaining chalk is 55% of the original 5 inches.

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 × 5 = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.2 × 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk."
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we need to determine the total number of students on varsity and then subtract that from the total number of students in the class.

First, let's calculate the number of girls on varsity. One-third of the 12 girls are on varsity, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 12 = 4$. Similarly, one-fourth of the 12 boys are on varsity, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 12 = 3$.

The total number of students on varsity is the sum of the number of girls and boys on varsity, which is $4 + 3 = 7$.

Now, we need to find the total number of students in the class. Since there are 12 boys and 12 girls, the total number of students is $12 + 12 = 24$.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students: $24 - 7 = 17$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of face masks Johnny bought, we need to calculate three times the number of face masks Mike purchased and then add 2.

Let's denote the number of face masks Mike bought as M. We know that M = 5.

Now, we calculate three times the number of face masks Mike bought: 3M = 3 * 5 = 15.

Next, we add 2 to this result to find the number of face masks Johnny bought: 15 + 2 = 17.

Therefore, the number of face masks Johnny bought is 17.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the ratio of the total number of teeth fixed to the total number of teeth James has.

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth drilled and capped, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

To find the percentage, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has and multiply by 100:

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, the correct answer is 50%."
"To determine the amount of milk that was returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons. This can be done by multiplying the numerator (2) by the total gallons (4000) and then dividing by the denominator (5).

2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5

To simplify this, we can first multiply 2 and 4000, which gives us 8000. Then, we divide 8000 by 5.

8000 / 5 = 1600

So, 1600 gallons of milk were returned.

Now, to find the total refund, we need to multiply the number of gallons returned (1600) by the cost per gallon ($3.5).

Refund = 1600 * 3.5

Using the distributive property of multiplication, we can rewrite this as:

Refund = (1600 * 3) + (1600 * 0.5)

First, we multiply 1600 by 3:

1600 * 3 = 4800

Then, we multiply 1600 by 0.5:

1600 * 0.5 = 800

Now, we add the two results together:

Refund = 4800 + 800 = 5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as the equation:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation, we apply the distributive property to the right-hand side:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + (35/3)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of books Bob can buy per school, we need to calculate the total number of books he can purchase with his $27,000 budget. 

First, we'll find the total number of books he can buy with his money. Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we'll divide the total amount of money by the cost per 100 books.

Total books = $27,000 / $500
Total books = 54

Now, we'll divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Books per school = Total books / Number of schools
Books per school = 54 / 3
Books per school = 18

Therefore, Bob can buy 18 books per school.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"Let's analyze the situation step by step, applying mathematical principles to determine the number of apples Newton brought home.

Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. This means he had 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples. The total number of apples at this point is 1 (in pocket) + 5 (new) = 6.

Next, he put all but 1 of the new apples in his pocket, leaving 1 apple outside. So, the total number of apples is now 1 (outside) + 5 (in pocket) = 6.

Then, he threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. This means he now has 6 apples from the previous step and 6 new apples. The total number of apples is 6 (from previous step) + 6 (new) = 12.

Finally, he picked up all the remaining apples, so he now has 12 apples in total.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to calculate the number of bags of coal he ordered and multiply it by the cost per bag.

The weight of coal ordered is 850 kg, and it's delivered in 50 kg bags. To find the number of bags, we divide the total weight by the weight per bag:

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

The cost per bag is $18. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 * $18

The final answer is: $306"
"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will consume. 

For the cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 × 6 = 36. Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is 36 ÷ 12 = 3.

For the pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 × 6 = 24. Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 24 ÷ 8 = 3.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To calculate the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to sum the miles he ran on each day. 

Let's break it down: Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. This is a simple multiplication problem: 3 miles/day * 3 days = 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

Next, we consider the miles he ran on Tuesday and Thursday: 5 miles/day * 2 days = 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

The total miles Sam ran this week is 19 miles."
"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic techniques.

Let's denote the time it takes to build 60 snowballs as 't' minutes. Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. So, his rate of building snowballs is 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, the rate at which they melt is 2/15 snowballs per minute.

To find the net rate of snowballs, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate: 

$$\frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{5}{15} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5}$$

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, we need to find out how long it will take to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute. 

We can set up the equation:

$$\frac{1}{5}t = 60$$

To solve for 't', we multiply both sides by 5:

$$t = 60 \times 5$$

$$t = 300$$

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"Let's denote John's current age as J and Jim's current age as M. We are given that J = 28 and that 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim. 

We can express this relationship as an equation: J - 20 = 2(M - 20).

Substituting J = 28 into the equation, we get 28 - 20 = 2(M - 20).

Simplifying the equation, we get 8 = 2M - 40.

Adding 40 to both sides of the equation, we get 48 = 2M.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get M = 24.

Therefore, Jim's current age is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of slices each person ate and then sum them up.

Let's denote the number of slices Doxa ate as D, her sister as S, and her brother as B. We know that:

D = 1 (Doxa ate 1 slice)
S = D + 1 (her sister ate 1 more than Doxa)
B = S + 1 (her brother ate 1 more than her sister)

Substituting the value of D into the equation for S, we get:
S = 1 + 1 = 2

Now, substituting the value of S into the equation for B, we get:
B = 2 + 1 = 3

Now, we add up the number of slices each person ate:
D + S + B = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

Therefore, the total number of slices they all ate is 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information step by step. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the number of bandages they had after the first day is x - 38 + 50.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. Therefore, the number of bandages they had after the second day is (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages, and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. So, the number of bandages they had after the third day is ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:
x = 21

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the difference in length and multiply it by the cost per inch. 

Let's denote the initial length of May's hair as L1 and the final length as L2. We know that L1 = 10 inches and L2 = 8 inches. The difference in length, ΔL, is given by:

ΔL = L1 - L2
ΔL = 10 - 8
ΔL = 2 inches

The cost per inch of haircut is $30. Therefore, the cost of the haircut is:

Cost of haircut = ΔL * $30
Cost of haircut = 2 * $30
Cost of haircut = $60

Additionally, the cost of the color is $40. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color:

Total cost = Cost of haircut + Cost of color
Total cost = $60 + $40
Total cost = $100

The final answer is: $100"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings, we need to determine her regular pay and attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. We know that Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 4 * 6 = 24 days in April. Her total hours worked in April is 7.5 * 24 = 180 hours. Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular pay is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus. Jen receives an additional $10 for each day she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 24 days. Her attendance bonus is 24 * $10 = $240.

Now, let's add her regular pay and attendance bonus to find her total earnings:
Total earnings = Regular pay + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $240
Total earnings = $510

The final answer is: $510"
"To calculate Jason's earnings, we need to determine the total amount he earned from each task and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the earnings for each task:

- Laundry: Jason earned $3.00 for doing his laundry once.
- Cleaning the room: He earned $1.50 for cleaning his room once.
- Taking the trash out: Jason earned $0.75 for taking the trash out twice, so we multiply $0.75 by 2: $0.75 × 2 = $1.50.
- Emptying the dishwasher: He earned $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher six times, so we multiply $0.50 by 6: $0.50 × 6 = $3.00.

Now, let's add up the earnings:
$3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To determine the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to establish the blood volume of a single shark. Given that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the blood volume of a shark as follows:

Blood volume of a shark = 3 * Blood volume of a whale
= 3 * 40 gallons
= 120 gallons

Now, to find the total blood volume of ten sharks, we multiply the blood volume of a single shark by the number of sharks:

Total blood volume of ten sharks = Blood volume of a shark * Number of sharks
= 120 gallons/shark * 10 sharks
= 1200 gallons

Therefore, the total amount of blood in ten sharks is 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, we have 50 people who entered in the morning. Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00. 

Next, we need to determine the number of people who entered for lunch. It is stated that twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in for lunch. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, we can express this as 2 * 40 = 80 people.

Finally, we have an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people who entered at each time:
50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (lunch) + 150 (evening) = 320

The final answer is: 320"
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and the number of black pens.

First, we know Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 5 × 5 = 25 red pens.

We also know that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is 2 × 25 = 2 × 5 × 5 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"To determine the total cost of John's purchase, we need to calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately and then add them together.

Let's start by finding the cost per bottle of scotch. The total cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles, so the cost per bottle is calculated as follows:

$$\frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of Bottles}} = \frac{\$600}{10} = \$60$$

Now, let's find the cost per bottle of cognac. The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, which can be expressed as a multiplier of 1.5. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

$$\text{Cost per Bottle of Cognac} = \text{Cost per Bottle of Scotch} \times 1.5 = \$60 \times 1.5 = \$90$$

Next, we need to find the total cost of the cognac. Since there are twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, the number of bottles of cognac is:

$$\text{Number of Bottles of Cognac} = 2 \times \text{Number of Bottles of Scotch} = 2 \times 10 = 20$$

The total cost of the cognac is then:

$$\text{Total Cost of Cognac} = \text{Cost per Bottle of Cognac} \times \text{Number of Bottles of Cognac} = \$90 \times 20 = \$1800$$

Finally, we can find the total cost of John's purchase by adding the cost of the scotch and the cognac:

$$\text{Total Cost} = \text{Total Cost of Scotch} + \text{Total Cost of Cognac} = \$600 + \$1800 = \$2400$$

The final answer is: $2400"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. Let's start by identifying the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted on each day.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, we can express this as 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making the total 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted 1/4 more than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more trees. Therefore, the total Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days by adding the White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees:

Total White Oak trees = 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is the sum of the White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees:
Total trees = 30 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 120

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the amount of root beer available for each person to drink at the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the incidents and then divide it by the number of people at the party.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, his wife accidentally spilled 7 gallons, resulting in 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remaining.

On the third day, his friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

Now, we have 8 gallons of root beer remaining for 3 people at the party. To find out how much each person gets, we divide the remaining amount by the number of people:

$$\frac{8}{3} = 2\frac{2}{3}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by translating the given statement into a mathematical equation. The phrase ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be represented as 4x + 8, where x is the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

We are given that this expression is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we can use the method of inverse operations to isolate the variable. First, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

(4x) / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we can calculate one-third of the total number of fish.

One-third of 66 = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = \frac{66}{3} = 22

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. First, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes.

Total fish = 66
Fish with red stripes = 22
Fish without red stripes = Total fish - Fish with red stripes = 66 - 22 = 44

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish.

\frac{5}{11} of 44 = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = \frac{5 \times 44}{11} = \frac{220}{11} = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes.

Fish with red stripes = 22
Fish with blue stripes = 20
Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"To determine the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had, subtract the number of colors she lost, and then subtract the number of colors she used up.

Amy initially had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets. Therefore, Amy initially had a total of 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one palette, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors. Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors. To find the number of eyeshadow colors she has left, we subtract 3 from 22: 22 - 3 = 19.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the given information.

Let's start by identifying the height of the two-story house, which is 7 times Mattison's height. Given that Mattison is 60 inches tall, we can express this relationship as:

Height of the two-story house = 7 × 60 inches
= 7 × 60
= 420 inches

Next, we are told that the floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height. Therefore, the height of the first floor is:

Height of the first floor = 3 × 60 inches
= 3 × 60
= 180 inches

Now, to find the height of the second floor, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the two-story house:

Height of the second floor = Height of the two-story house - Height of the first floor
= 420 inches - 180 inches
= 240 inches

Finally, to determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the two-story house:

Height of the roof from the second floor's floor = Height of the two-story house - Height of the second floor
= 420 inches - 240 inches
= 180 inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To find the number of shells found by team Alphas, we need to calculate 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share.

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters.

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)
= 700 - (280 + 252)
= 700 - 532
= 168 shells.

The final answer is: 168"
"To determine the miles walked by the last dog, we need to calculate the total miles walked by all 4 dogs and then subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs.

Let's denote the miles walked by the last dog as x. The total miles walked by all 4 dogs is the sum of the miles walked by each dog, which is given by the equation: 1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12.

We can simplify this equation by combining the constants: 8 + x = 12.

To isolate x, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: x = 12 - 8.

x = 4.

Therefore, the last dog needs 4 miles."
"To determine the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts, we need to calculate the loan amount and then subtract the amount used to pay off debts.

First, we find 40% of the value of his house, which is $250,000. To do this, we multiply 0.4 by $250,000.

0.4 × $250,000 = $100,000

This is the amount John borrowed. Now, we need to find 60% of this amount to determine how much he used to pay off his debts.

0.6 × $100,000 = $60,000

To find the leftover amount, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

Therefore, John had $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To calculate Deandre's earnings from selling the tunas, we need to determine the total weight of the tunas and then multiply it by the cost per kilogram.

The weights of the three tunas are given as 56 kilograms, 46 kilograms, and 26 kilograms. To find the total weight, we add these values together.

Total weight = 56 + 46 + 26
Total weight = 128 kilograms

Now, we know that a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50. To find the total earnings, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram.

Total earnings = Total weight * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

The final answer is: $64"
"To calculate Trinity's profit, we need to determine the selling price of the magazines. Given that she sells them at 11/8 of the cost price, we can express this as a multiplier of the cost price.

Let's denote the cost price as CP. The selling price (SP) is then given by:

SP = (11/8) * CP

We are given that the cost price (CP) is $72. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

SP = (11/8) * 72
SP = (11 * 72) / 8
SP = 792 / 8
SP = 99

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:

Profit = SP - CP
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To determine the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement, we need to calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then add them together.

Let's start by identifying the amount of water removed per day on each setting. The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 liters per day. The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water removed on each setting. Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, so the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters. He then ran it for 3 days on the medium setting, so the total amount of water removed on the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters. Finally, he ran it for 5 days on the high setting, so the total amount of water removed on the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

To find the total amount of water removed, we add the amounts removed on each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the number of balloons thrown during the water balloon fight, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of balloons and the number of balloons left.

First, we calculate the total number of balloons: 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons.

Therefore, the number of balloons thrown is 288.

The final answer is: $\boxed{288}$"
"To determine the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we need to calculate the amount of each medicine in one dose and then multiply it by 8.

The first medicine is 14 mL, and the second medicine is 3 times that amount, which is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

The total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the two medicines: 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8: 56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL.

The final answer is: $\boxed{448}$"
"To find the capacity of John's classes, we need to determine 1/8 of Ali's class capacity. 

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. To find 1/8 of 120, we can use the division operation. 

1/8 of 120 = 120 ÷ 8 = 15 students per class.

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is 15 * 2 = 30 students.

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of Ali's class capacity and John's classes capacity. 

Combined capacity = 120 (Ali's class) + 30 (John's classes) = 150 students.

The final answer is: 150"
"To determine the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the interest he owes his sister and subtract the total amount he pays in the first 11 months.

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which can be calculated as 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is 11 * 25 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the initial amount plus the interest minus the amount he paid in the first 11 months. This can be expressed as:

Total amount in twelfth month = Initial amount + Interest - Total amount paid in first 11 months
= 300 + 6 - 275
= 31

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine the number of diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to calculate the total number of diaper changes and then find the portion that Jordan is responsible for.

Let's start by calculating the total number of diaper changes per day. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, we can express this as a fraction: 1/2. To find the number of diapers Jordan changes, we need to multiply the total number of diaper changes by the fraction that represents Jordan's portion: 10 * (1/2) = 10/2 = 5.

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Given the jar's dimensions, we can calculate its volume using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

V = 6 * 6 * 15
V = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, we can find the actual volume used by the jelly beans by multiplying the total volume by 0.8.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Now, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean, which is 0.15 cubic inches.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans he guessed. 

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

The final answer is: 36"
"To determine the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, let's analyze the situation step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, increasing the total to 60. At the second stop, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered the bus, which is 3/4 * 40 = 30 people. Therefore, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is 60 + 30 = 90.

Now, at the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, resulting in a total of 2 * 90 = 180 people.

To find the number of remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current number of passengers from the bus's capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

The initial cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

To find the new cost of one visit after 5 years, we need to calculate the 150% increase. This can be done by adding 150% of the original cost to the original cost. 150% of $2 is 1.5 * $2 = $3. Therefore, the new cost of one visit is $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is $30 + $45 = $75.

"To determine the total time required for all students to try the escape room, we need to calculate the number of groups that can be formed from the total number of students and then multiply that by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

There are 4 grades with 10 students in each grade, resulting in a total of 4 * 10 = 40 students.

Since 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we divide the total number of students by 8 to find the number of groups: 40 / 8 = 5.

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. To find the total time required, we multiply the number of groups by the time per group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

Therefore, the total time required for all students to try the escape room is 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"

In this scenario, the total amount Ali has to pay John is $100."
"Given a board that is 40 feet long, we can denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be expressed as 4x.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 40

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 40/5
x = 8

Now that we have found the length of the shorter piece, we can determine the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

4x = 4(8)
4x = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs for his meatballs, we must first establish the ratio of meatballs to pounds of ground beef. Given that he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can express this as a ratio: 16 meatballs/pound.

Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs, so we need to find out how many pounds of ground beef are required to produce this quantity. To do this, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[ \text{Total pounds of meat needed} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs needed}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} \]
\[ \text{Total pounds of meat needed} = \frac{80}{16} \]
\[ \text{Total pounds of meat needed} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now that we know the total pounds of meat needed, we can calculate the total amount of seasoning required. Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, so we can multiply the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound:

\[ \text{Total seasoning needed} = \text{Total pounds of meat needed} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} \]
\[ \text{Total seasoning needed} = 5 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total seasoning needed} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs.

"To determine the cost of a 36-minute call from a payphone, we need to consider the rate change after 16 minutes. The initial rate is $0.25 per minute for the first 16 minutes, and the reduced rate is $0.2 per minute for the remaining minutes.

The cost for the first 16 minutes can be calculated as follows:

16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

The remaining minutes are 36 - 16 = 20 minutes. The cost for these minutes is:

20 minutes * $0.2/minute = $4.00

To find the total cost, we add the costs for the two segments:

$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

Therefore, the total cost of a 36-minute call from a payphone is $8.00."

Let's denote the amount of rain on Monday as M. Given that M = 2 inches.

The amount of rain on Tuesday is expected to be 1 more inch than twice the amount of rain on Monday. This can be expressed as 2M + 1.

Substituting the value of M, we get 2(2) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

Therefore, the total inches of rain on Tuesday is 5 inches."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as x. Since Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies can be expressed as 3x - 2.

We know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

To solve for x, we can combine like terms and isolate the variable:

x + 3x - 2 = 10
4x - 2 = 10
4x = 12
x = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the services, we need to first determine the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure. 

The original price of the manicure is $35, and a 20% discount is applied. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (20% or 0.20): $35 * 0.20 = $7. Subtracting the discount from the original price gives us the discounted price of the manicure: $35 - $7 = $28.

Similarly, the original price of the pedicure is $40, and a 20% discount is applied. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (20% or 0.20): $40 * 0.20 = $8. Subtracting the discount from the original price gives us the discounted price of the pedicure: $40 - $8 = $32.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is the sum of their discounted prices: $28 + $32 = $60.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the nail art. Since there are 10 fingers, and each nail costs $3, the total cost of the nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

To find the total cost of the services, we add the cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of magazines Susan receives annually, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and sum them up.

Let's denote the number of issues from the first 3 magazines as 12i, where i is the number of magazines. Since there are 3 magazines, we have 12 * 3 = 36 issues.

The second magazine sends 6 issues per year.

The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives a total of 66 magazines per year.

The final answer is: 66"
"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as K, the number of paintings Shelley has as S, and the number of paintings Samantha has as Sa. We are given the following information:

1. Sa = S - 12
2. S = K + 8
3. Sa = 27

We can substitute the value of Sa from equation (3) into equation (1) to get:

27 = S - 12

Now, we can solve for S:

S = 27 + 12
S = 39

Next, we can substitute the value of S into equation (2) to find the value of K:

39 = K + 8

Now, we can solve for K:

K = 39 - 8
K = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

The final answer is: 31"
"To determine the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to apply the percentage changes sequentially.

First, we calculate the price increase in December: 
Price increase = 80% of $40 = 0.8 * $40 = $32
New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

Next, we calculate the price decrease in January:
Price decrease = 50% of $72 = 0.5 * $72 = $36
New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"To determine the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total amount from the standard rate lessons. Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. This can be expressed as:

Total amount from standard rate lessons = 4 × $80 = $320

Next, we need to calculate the total amount from the reduced rate lessons. Charlie has 2 lessons at 75% of his standard rate, which is equivalent to 0.75 × $80 = $60 per hour. This can be expressed as:

Total amount from reduced rate lessons = 2 × $60 = $120

Now, we can find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day by adding the amounts from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons:

Total amount of money Charlie will make for the day = $320 + $120 = $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To calculate the mean score, we need to compute the arithmetic mean of the given dataset. The formula for the mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values.

Given the scores: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60, we can calculate the sum as follows:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{9} x_i = 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630$$

There are 9 scores in the dataset. To find the mean, we divide the sum by the number of scores:

$$\text{Mean} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{9} x_i}{9} = \frac{630}{9} = 70$$

Therefore, the mean score is 70.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pomelos Eve gave away. Let's denote the original number of pomelos as $x$. We are given that Eve is left with $\frac{1}{4}$ of the original amount. This can be expressed as:

$$\frac{1}{4}x = 5$$

To find the value of $x$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

$$x = 5 \cdot 4$$

$$x = 20$$

This means Eve originally had 20 pomelos. Since she is left with $\frac{1}{4}$ of the original amount, we can find the number of pomelos she gave away by subtracting the remaining amount from the original amount:

Number of pomelos given away = Original amount - Remaining amount
= 20 - 5
= 15

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find the number of apples Walter ate. To do this, we'll calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples.

Next, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we need to find 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To do this, we'll multiply 36 by 0.25 (since 25% is equivalent to 25/100 or 0.25).

0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

The amount of money he received = 27 * 3 = $81

The final answer is: $81"
"To determine the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we can use a simple proportion. If 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year, we can set up the following equation:

Let x be the total number of novels written this year.

9 = (3/4)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3 to isolate x.

x = 9 * (4/3)

x = 12

Therefore, Regina wrote 12 novels this year.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in 3 days at an average speed of 50 km/hr.

First, we calculate the total hours traveled: 3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours.

Next, we use the formula Distance = Speed * Time to find the distance covered: 50 km/hr * 72 hr = 3600 km.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the distance covered by dividing the distance traveled by the total distance and multiplying by 100: (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 0.6 * 100 = 60%.

Therefore, the percentage of the distance covered by Michael is 60%.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial number of grapes. Let's denote the initial number of grapes as x.

Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

The remaining grapes are used by their mother to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she can make is x - 36 / 12. However, since the number of pies must be a whole number, we can set up the equation:

x - 36 = 12n

where n is the number of pies. Solving for x, we get:

x = 12n + 36

Since the mother used all the remaining grapes to make 3 pies, we can substitute n = 3 into the equation:

x = 12(3) + 36
x = 36 + 36
x = 72

However, this is not the initial number of grapes. We need to consider that the mother used all the remaining grapes after Madeline and her brother used 36 grapes. Therefore, the initial number of grapes is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline and her brother and the grapes used by their mother to make 3 pies:

x = 36 + 3(12)
x = 36 + 36
x = 72

However, this is still not the initial number of grapes. We need to consider that the mother used all the remaining grapes after Madeline and her brother used 36 grapes. Since the mother used 3 pies, which is 3 * 12 = 36 grapes, the initial number of grapes is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline and her brother and the grapes used by their mother to make 3 pies, plus the grapes used by the mother to make the 3 pies:

x = 36 + 36 + 36
x = 108

However, this is still not the initial number of grapes. We need to consider that the mother used all the remaining grapes after Madeline and her brother used 36 grapes. Since the mother used 3 pies, which is 3 * 12 = 36 grapes, the initial number of grapes is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline and her brother and the grapes used by their mother to make 3 pies, plus the grapes used by the mother to make the 3 pies, plus the grapes used by Madeline and her brother, plus the grapes used by the mother to make the 3 pies, plus the grapes used by the mother to

"To determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School on that day, we need to calculate the number of teachers who were not absent and then add the number of substitute teachers.

First, we subtract the number of teachers who were sick from the total number of teachers to find the number of teachers who were present.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of teachers sick = 13

Number of teachers not sick = Total number of teachers - Number of teachers sick
= 82 - 13
= 69

Next, we add the number of substitute teachers to the number of teachers who were not sick to find the total number of teachers at school.

Number of substitute teachers = 9

Total number of teachers at school = Number of teachers not sick + Number of substitute teachers
= 69 + 9
= 78

Therefore, the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School that day was 78."
"To determine the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. 
The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00.
The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total weekly cost of the macaroni and cheese is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To determine the percentage of the custodian's day spent cleaning classrooms, we first need to calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Given that it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time is 80 * 15 minutes = 1200 minutes.

Converting this to hours, we divide by 60: 1200 / 60 = 20 hours.

The custodian works 8 hours a day for 5 days, resulting in a total of 5 * 8 = 40 hours available for cleaning.

To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we divide the time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiply by 100: (20 / 40) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms is 50%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we must first calculate the capacity of each shelf. 

Let's denote the capacity of a middle shelf as M. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, its capacity is 2M. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so its capacity is 2M - 5.

We know that the capacity of a middle shelf is 10 books. Therefore, M = 10.

Now, let's calculate the capacity of each shelf:
- Middle shelf: M = 10
- Bottom shelf: 2M = 2 * 10 = 20
- Top shelf: 2M - 5 = 2 * 10 - 5 = 15

The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of its shelves: M + M + 2M + (2M - 5) = 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

To find the number of bookcases needed, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 / 55 = 2.

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate Rose's profit, we first need to determine the total cost of the eggs. Since she bought five dozens for $2.40 per dozen, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Total Cost = Number of Dozens × Cost per Dozen
Total Cost = 5 × $2.40
Total Cost = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Rose bought a total of 5 × 12 = 60 eggs.

Next, we need to find the total revenue. She sells each set of 3 eggs for $1. To determine the number of sets, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:

Number of Sets = Total Eggs ÷ 3
Number of Sets = 60 ÷ 3
Number of Sets = 20

Now, we can calculate the total revenue:

Total Revenue = Number of Sets × Price per Set
Total Revenue = 20 × $1
Total Revenue = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the number of white hats, we first need to find the number of red and blue hats.

The fraction of red hats is 1/2, so the number of red hats is 100 * (1/2) = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

The fraction of blue hats is 3/5 of the remaining hats, which can be expressed as (3/5) * (50/1) = (3/5) * 50 = 30.

To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats: 100 - 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to calculate the discounted price of the bag and then divide it by the number of sticks.

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. 

Discounted price = Original price - Discount
= $18.00 - $3.00
= $15.00

To convert the discounted price to cents, we multiply by 100:
$15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents

Now, we divide the cost per bag in cents by the number of sticks per bag to find the cost per stick:
Cost per stick = Cost per bag in cents / Number of sticks per bag
= 1500 / 30
= 50 cents

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky is 50 cents.

"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we need to find the total number of questions she needs to get right and subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test.

Let's denote the total number of questions as T, the number of questions on the first test as T1, the number of questions on the second test as T2, the percentage of questions she needs to get right as P, and the number of questions she got right on the first test as Q1.

We know that T = T1 + T2, T1 = 70, T2 = 40, and P = 0.7. We also know that Q1 = 0.6 * T1.

First, let's find the total number of questions she needs to get right: P * T = 0.7 * (T1 + T2) = 0.7 * (70 + 40) = 0.7 * 110 = 77.

Since she got 60% of the questions on the first test right, Q1 = 0.6 * T1 = 0.6 * 70 = 42.

Now, we can find the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test: Q2 = P * T - Q1 = 77 - 42 = 35.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B.

We are given two equations:

1. B = 5S - 4
2. S + B = 116

We can substitute the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation:

S + (5S - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6S - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6S = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

S = 20

Now that we know S, we can find B:

B = 5S - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{96}$"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we need to apply the fundamental principles of arithmetic operations, specifically multiplication.

Given:
- Number of games per year: 40
- Score per game: 21 points
- Number of years: 4

First, we calculate the total points scored per year by multiplying the number of games played by the score per game: 40 games/year * 21 points/game = 840 points/year.

Next, we multiply the total points scored per year by the number of years to find the overall total: 840 points/year * 4 years = 3360 points.

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360.

The final answer is: 3360"
"To determine the number of marbles Brendan ended up with, let's break down the sequence of events:

1. Brendan initially had 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, which is equivalent to 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. He then found 3 more marbles, so the total number of marbles he had is 5 + 3 = 8.
4. However, one of the marbles he picked up was a bead, not a marble, so we need to subtract 1 from the total: 8 - 1 = 7.

Therefore, Brendan ended up with 7 marbles.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus, we need to apply the concept of proportional reasoning.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The conversion rate from customers to sales is 1:2, meaning for every 2 customers, 1 sale is made. To find the number of customers needed to achieve 15 sales, we multiply the target sales by 2:
   15 sales * 2 customers/sale = 30 customers

2. The conversion rate from telephone calls to customers is 1:25, meaning for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer is generated. To find the number of telephone calls needed to achieve 30 customers, we multiply the target customers by 25:
   30 customers * 25 calls/customer = 750 calls

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: 750"
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the household, and each person has a flashlight. Therefore, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

To find the number of small candles, we multiply the number of rooms with small candles (4) by the number of small candles per room (4): 4 * 4 = 16 small candles.

To find the number of medium candles, we multiply the number of rooms with medium candles (4) by the number of medium candles per room (5): 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.

Now, we add the total number of small candles and medium candles to find the total number of candles: 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Finally, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 + 36 = 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of chips each family member receives, we must first calculate the total number of chips available. Since Mitchell purchases two bags of chips, each containing 55 chips, the total number of chips is given by the product of the number of bags and the number of chips per bag:

2 bags × 55 chips/bag = 110 chips

Now, to find the number of chips each family member receives, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members:

110 chips ÷ 5 family members = 22 chips/family member

Therefore, each family member will receive 22 chips.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and then sum them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 2 * 5 = 10 minutes each. 
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides: 
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

The total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"When analyzing word problems, it's essential to break down the information provided and identify the relationships between the variables. In this scenario, we're given the following information:

- The number of helmets is 20.
- The number of robots is half the number of helmets, which can be expressed as 20 / 2 = 10.
- The number of helmets is half the number of footballs, so the number of footballs is 20 * 2 = 40.

To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to sum the number of robots, helmets, and footballs: 10 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (football) = 70.

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the number of calls Tim deals with in a 5-day work week, we need to calculate the number of calls he handles in a day and then multiply it by the number of working days.

First, let's convert the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can express 15 minutes as a fraction of an hour: $\frac{15}{60} = \frac{1}{4}$ hours.

Now, we can calculate the number of calls Tim handles in a day by dividing the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call: $\frac{6 \text{ hours}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ hours per call}} = 6 \times 4 = 24$ calls per day.

To find the total number of calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by the number of working days: $24 \text{ calls per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 120$ calls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the time difference in drying between the old and new varnish on 6 paintings, we first calculate the total time for each type of varnish. 

For the old varnish, the time to dry one painting is 7 minutes. Therefore, the total time to dry 6 paintings is 6 * 7 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, the time to dry one painting is 12 minutes. Therefore, the total time to dry 6 paintings is 6 * 12 = 72 minutes.

Now, we find the difference in time between the old and new varnish: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we must calculate the water required for each type of plant and sum these values.

First, we identify the number of plants in each category: 4 plants need half a cup of water, 8 plants need 1 cup of water, and the remaining plants need a quarter of a cup of water. The number of plants requiring a quarter of a cup of water is 20 - 4 - 8 = 8.

Now, we calculate the water needed for each type of plant:
- For the 4 plants requiring half a cup of water: 4 \* 0.5 = 2 cups
- For the 8 plants requiring 1 cup of water: 8 \* 1 = 8 cups
- For the 8 plants requiring a quarter of a cup of water: 8 \* 0.25 = 2 cups

To find the total amount of water needed, we add the water required for each type of plant: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"Given that Phineas Frog is 200 yards away from his home in the swamp, we need to determine the time it will take him to return home, considering he hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute on land and swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute in water. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the time taken for each segment and sum them.

First, we calculate the time taken to cover the 100 yards on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute
Time = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time taken to cover the 100 yards in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute
Time = 10 minutes

To find the total time taken to return home, we add the times for both segments:

Total Time = Time on land + Time in water
Total Time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total Time = 15 minutes

Therefore, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is 15 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"

Number of boxes needed: 7
Total cost: 7 × $2.00 = $14.00

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"Given that the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone and the main phone costs $20, we can determine the cost of the additional phones and the total cost of the plan.

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x. We are given that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

$$
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{20}{2}
$$

$$
x = 10
$$

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

$$
4x = 4 \cdot 10
$$

$$
4x = 40
$$

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

$$
\text{Total cost} = 20 + 40
$$

$$
\text{Total cost} = 60
$$

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine Derrick's daily revenue, we first calculate the number of doughnuts he sells in a day. Since he produces 10 dozen doughnuts, and 1 dozen equals 12, the total number of doughnuts per day is 10 × 12 = 120.

The price of each doughnut is $2. Therefore, the daily revenue is 120 × $2 = $240.

June has 30 days. To find the total revenue for the month, we multiply the daily revenue by the number of days: $240 × 30 = $7200.

The final answer is: $7200"

210 ÷ 42 = 5.

Therefore, Jade will need 5 days to upload all her photos."
"To determine the total cost of dry-cleaning Alicia's clothes for 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

The weekly cost of dry-cleaning can be calculated as follows:

Weekly cost = (5 blouses * $5.00) + (1 skirt * $6.00) + (2 pants * $8.00)
Weekly cost = (5 * $5.00) + $6.00 + (2 * $8.00)
Weekly cost = $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00
Weekly cost = $47.00

To find the total cost for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:

Total cost = Weekly cost * 5
Total cost = $47.00 * 5
Total cost = $235.00

The final answer is: $235.00"
"To determine the time it takes for John to speak 10 pages, we first need to calculate his new speaking speed in words per minute (WPM) and then convert it to hours.

John's original speaking speed is 150 WPM. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed. 

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Since we want to find the time in hours, we need to convert the new speed from WPM to words per hour (WP60). There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert WPM to WP60 by multiplying by 60.

New speed (WP60) = 375 WPM * 60 = 22,500 WP60

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4,500 words

To find the time it takes to speak 4,500 words, we can divide the total number of words by the new speaking speed in WP60.

Time = Total words / New speed (WP60) = 4,500 words / 22,500 WP60 = 0.2 hours

To convert hours to a more meaningful unit, we can multiply by 60 to get minutes.

Time (minutes) = 0.2 hours * 60 = 12 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

Let's start by calculating the number of people Conor saw on the first three days. On the first day, he saw 50 people. On the second day, the number of people increased by 20, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people. On the third day, the number of people doubled from the second day, so he saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is the sum of these values: 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, we can calculate the total number of people he saw on the remaining days by multiplying the average by the number of days: 60 * 4 = 240.

Now, we can find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week by adding the number of people he saw on the first three days to the number of people he saw on the remaining days: 260 + 240 = 500.

The final answer is: $\boxed{500}$"
"To determine the total number of popcorn pieces Garrett has to eat, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and add them up.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.
5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

The final answer is: 210"
"To determine the number of lemons Tim needs, we first calculate the total amount of lemonade he must prepare. He requires 4 gallons for the party and an additional gallon for Allen, which is twice as tart.

Total gallons = 4 + 1 = 5 gallons

Since each gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice, we can calculate the total amount of juice needed.

Total cups of juice = 5 gallons × 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups

The extra tart lemonade requires twice the amount of lemon juice, so we calculate the additional juice needed.

Extra tart lemonade cups = 1 gallon × 2 = 2 cups

Now, we can find the total number of lemons required for the extra tart lemonade.

Extra tart lemons = 2 cups / (1 cup / 6 lemons) = 2 × 6 = 12 lemons

For the regular lemonade, we calculate the number of lemons needed.

Regular lemons = 5 cups / (1 cup / 6 lemons) = 5 × 6 = 30 lemons

To find the total number of lemons required, we add the lemons needed for the regular and extra tart lemonade.

Total lemons = 12 lemons + 30 lemons = 42 lemons

The final answer is: 42"
"To determine the total amount of dog food required for the kennel, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both German Shepherds and Bulldogs, and then multiply it by 7 to find the weekly consumption.

The daily consumption of German Shepherds can be calculated as follows:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg/day

Similarly, the daily consumption of Bulldogs is:
2 Bulldogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg/day

Now, we add the daily consumption of both breeds to find the total daily consumption:
15 kg/day + 6 kg/day = 21 kg/day

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7:
21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg

Therefore, the kennel will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged and 4-legged animals separately and then find the total number of pairs.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals: 10 animals * 2 legs per animal = 20 legs.

Next, we calculate the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals: 15 animals * 4 legs per animal = 60 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of animals: 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs.

To find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2: 80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"Let's denote the number of blue blocks as B, the number of yellow blocks as Y, and the number of red blocks as R. We are given that B = 4 and Y = 2B. The total number of blocks is 32, so we can write the equation:

B + Y + R = 32

Substituting Y = 2B into the equation, we get:

B + 2B + R = 32

Combine like terms:

3B + R = 32

We know that B = 4, so substitute this value into the equation:

3(4) + R = 32

Simplify the equation:

12 + R = 32

Subtract 12 from both sides:

R = 20

Therefore, the number of red blocks is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the net displacement of Elvis's journey. To do this, we need to consider the distances traveled in both the westward and eastward directions.

Let's denote the speed as 's' (which is given as 18mph), the time traveled west as 't_w' (5 hours), and the time traveled east as 't_e' (8 hours). The distance traveled west is given by the formula d_w = s * t_w, and the distance traveled east is given by d_e = s * t_e.

We can calculate the distances as follows:
d_w = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles
d_e = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since the eastward and westward distances are in opposite directions, we need to find the net displacement, which is the difference between the two distances. The net displacement is given by d_net = d_e - d_w.

d_net = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

The initial value of the boat is $9000. 

In the first year, the boat depreciates by 30%, which is equivalent to 0.3 as a decimal. To find the depreciation amount, we multiply the initial value by this decimal: $9000 * 0.3 = $2700. Subtracting this from the initial value gives us the value after the first year: $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30%, or 0.3 as a decimal. We multiply the value after the first year by this decimal: $6300 * 0.3 = $1890. Subtracting this from the value after the first year gives us the value after the second year: $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20%, which is equivalent to 0.2 as a decimal. We multiply the value after the second year by this decimal: $4410 * 0.2 = $882. Subtracting this from the value after the second year gives us the value after the third year: $4410 - $882 = $3528.

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. We are given that a large bag of Starbursts candy contains 232 pieces of individually wrapped candies. The bag has 54 red candies, twice that amount of orange candies, and half as many yellow candies as red candies.

Let's start by finding the number of orange candies. Since it's twice the number of red candies, we can express this as 2 * 54 = 108.

Next, we need to find the number of yellow candies, which is half the number of red candies. This can be calculated as 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we have the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies in the bag: 232 - 189 = 43.

Therefore, the number of pink candies in the bag is 43.

The final answer is: 43"
"To calculate the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to consider the expenses for the hotel and the bus trips separately.

The cost of the hotel can be calculated by multiplying the cost of one night by the number of nights. Given that one night at the hotel costs $80, the total cost for 3 nights is:

$$\text{Total cost of hotel} = 80 \times 3 = 240$$

Now, let's calculate the cost of the bus trips. We are told that each bus trip costs 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel. To find the cost of one bus trip, we can express 10% as a decimal and multiply it by the cost of one night at the hotel:

$$\text{Cost of one bus trip} = 0.1 \times 80 = 8$$

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is:

$$\text{Total cost of bus trips} = 8 \times 7 = 56$$

To find the total cost of the trip, we add the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips:

$$\text{Total cost of trip} = 240 + 56 = 296$$

The final answer is: $296"
"Given that Mazie has 52 marbles and gives them to twins, Dallas and Darla, and Dallas has a total of 21 marbles after dropping 4 of them in the playground, we can determine the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla.

First, we need to find out how many marbles Dallas initially received. Since he has 21 marbles after dropping 4, we can calculate his initial amount by adding the marbles he dropped back to his current total:

Dallas' initial marbles = 21 (current marbles) + 4 (dropped marbles) = 25 marbles

Now, we know that Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins. To find out how many marbles Darla received, we subtract the number of marbles Dallas received from the total:

Darla's marbles = Total marbles - Dallas' marbles
= 52 - 25
= 27

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla."
"To calculate the total cost of the family's cinema outing, we need to consider the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately.

The cost of the adult tickets is 2 * $12 = $24. This is a straightforward application of the distributive property of multiplication over addition.

The cost of the child ticket is $8, which is a fixed value.

The cost of the popcorns is 2 * $3 = $6. This is another instance of the distributive property in action.

Now, let's add the costs together: $24 + $8 + $6 = $38.

In this scenario, the total cost of the family's cinema outing is $38.

The final answer is: $38"
"To determine the force required to move the car, we need to calculate 1% of the total weight of the car, luggage, and children.

First, let's find the total weight by adding the individual weights together:

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Now, we need to find 1% of the total weight. To do this, we multiply the total weight by 0.01 (since 1% is equivalent to 0.01 as a decimal).

Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

Therefore, the force required to move the car is 16 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of James' backyard fence, we have:

l = 20 feet (length)
w = 15 feet (width)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P = 2(20) + 2(15)
P = 40 + 30
P = 70

Therefore, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"Given that Mia is 40 years old and she is younger than Emma by 16 years, we can determine Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age. Therefore, Emma's age is 40 + 16 = 56 years.

To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we need to calculate the sum of their ages and divide it by 2. The sum of their ages is 40 + 56 = 96. Dividing this sum by 2 yields the average age: 96 / 2 = 48.

The average age of Mia and Emma is 48."
"To determine the total number of good seashells, we need to calculate the total number of seashells found and then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

Let's start by adding the number of seashells found by each individual: Tom found 214 seashells, Nancy found 432 seashells, and Benny found 86 seashells. 

The total number of seashells found is the sum of these individual counts: 214 + 432 + 86 = 732.

Now, we need to subtract the number of cracked seashells, which is 67, from the total number of seashells found.

Total good seashells = Total seashells found - Total cracked seashells
Total good seashells = 732 - 67
Total good seashells = 665

The final answer is: 665"
"To determine the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then multiply it by the number of people.

Let's start by calculating the cost of each type of plate. The cost of dinner plates is $6.00 each, and Avery needs 12 plates, so the total cost of dinner plates is 12 × $6.00 = $72.

The cost of bowls is $5.00 each, and Avery needs 12 bowls, so the total cost of bowls is 12 × $5.00 = $60.

The cost of salad plates is $4.00 each, and Avery needs 12 salad plates, so the total cost of salad plates is 12 × $4.00 = $48.

Now, we can find the total cost of the place settings by adding the cost of dinner plates, bowls, and salad plates: $72 + $60 + $48 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To determine the time it took Anna to complete the puzzle, we need to calculate half of Steve's time and then add 2 hours to it.

Let's denote Steve's time as S. We know that S = 10 hours.

Half of Steve's time is S/2 = 10/2 = 5 hours.

Anna's time is 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, so we add 2 hours to 5 hours.

Anna's time = 5 + 2 = 7 hours.

Therefore, it took Anna 7 hours to complete the puzzle.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the amount of feed left after a week, we need to calculate the total feed consumption by the pigs and subtract it from the initial amount ordered.

First, let's find the daily feed consumption of the pigs. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the daily consumption per pig is 4 × 2 = 8 pounds. With 5 pigs, the total daily consumption is 5 × 8 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the weekly consumption. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total weekly consumption is 40 pounds/day × 7 days = 40 × 7 = 280 pounds.

Given that Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, the amount left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount John needs to spend on hot dogs, we must first calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party.

Let's denote the number of guests as $g$, the number of hot dogs each guest will eat as $h$, and the number of hot dogs already available as $a$. We are given that $g = 20$, $h = 2$, and $a = 4$.

The total number of hot dogs required is the sum of the number of hot dogs each guest will eat and the number of hot dogs already available: $g \cdot h + a$.

Substituting the given values, we get:
$20 \cdot 2 + 4 = 40 + 4 = 44$

However, we need to find the number of hot dogs John needs to buy, not the total number of hot dogs required. To do this, we subtract the number of hot dogs already available from the total number of hot dogs required:
$44 - 4 = 40$

Now, we need to find the number of packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2. Let's denote the number of packs as $p$. We can set up the following equation:
$6p = 40$

To solve for $p$, we divide both sides by 6:
$p = \frac{40}{6} = \frac{20}{3}$

Since we cannot buy a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 6 packs and a half pack, but since we can't buy a half pack, we need to buy 7 packs to have enough hot dogs.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack:
$7 \cdot 2 = 14$

The final answer is: $14"
"To determine Frances' remaining funds, we need to calculate her total revenue and subtract her total expenses.

First, let's calculate her revenue from cupcakes: 20 cupcakes * $2 = $40. This is a straightforward application of the distributive property of multiplication over addition.

Next, we'll calculate her revenue from cookies: 40 cookies * $1 = $40. Again, this is a simple multiplication problem.

Now, we'll add her revenue from cupcakes and cookies to find her total revenue: $40 + $40 = $80.

Moving on to her expenses, we know she bought 5 trays at $4 each. To find her total expenses, we multiply the number of trays by the cost per tray: 5 * $4 = $20.

Finally, we subtract her total expenses from her total revenue to find her remaining funds: $80 - $20 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"This problem involves a sequence of additions and subtractions, which can be solved using basic arithmetic operations. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 5 children.
2. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, resulting in a total of 5 + 5 = 10 children.
3. On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children, resulting in a total of 10 + 2 × 10 = 10 + 20 = 30 children.
4. The original 5 children then leave the group, leaving 30 - 5 = 25 children.

This sequence can also be represented using a formula: 

Let's denote the number of children at the end of the nth street as Cn. Then, we have:

C1 = 5
C2 = C1 + C1 = 5 + 5 = 10
C3 = C2 + 2C2 = 10 + 20 = 30
C4 = C3 + 2C3 = 30 + 60 = 90

However, we are only interested in the number of children after the original 5 leave, which is C3 - 5 = 30 - 5 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to calculate the difference between the total meals she has and the total meals she has already given out.

Let's start by calculating the total meals given out:

Total meals given out = 64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday)
Total meals given out = 142

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the total meals Mamou has:

Total meals Mamou has = 1,360
Meals left to distribute = Total meals Mamou has - Total meals given out
Meals left to distribute = 1,360 - 142
Meals left to distribute = 1,218

The final answer is: 1218"
"To determine the total amount of money James has, we need to calculate the value of each coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth 25 cents, which can be represented as 25¢ or $0.25. Two nickels are worth 2 x 5¢ = 10¢. Seven dimes are worth 7 x 10¢ = 70¢.

Now, let's add the values together:
25¢ + 10¢ + 70¢ = 105¢

Converting the total to dollars, we get:
105¢ = $1.05

Therefore, James has a total of $1.05."
"To determine the total age of the siblings, we need to calculate the age of the older brother and then sum the ages of all the siblings.

Let's denote the age of the older brother as x. Since one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother, we can express this relationship as:

x / 2 = 12

To find the value of x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 12 * 2
x = 24

Now that we know the age of the older brother, we can calculate the total age of the 3 sisters, who are all 16 years old:

Total age of sisters = 16 * 3
Total age of sisters = 48

Next, we calculate the total age of the 2 brothers:

Total age of brothers = 12 + 24
Total age of brothers = 36

Finally, we sum the total age of the brothers and sisters to find the total age of all the siblings:

Total age of all siblings = Total age of brothers + Total age of sisters
Total age of all siblings = 36 + 48
Total age of all siblings = 84

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation per week. Since Charisma meditates 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, the total meditation time per day is 15 + 15 = 30 minutes. Since she meditates 7 days a week, the total meditation time per week is 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga per week. Since Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week, the total yoga time per week is 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.

Now, we can find the total time spent on meditation and yoga per week by adding the time spent on each activity: 210 minutes/week (meditation) + 300 minutes/week (yoga) = 510 minutes/week.

To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks, we multiply the total time spent per week by 4: 510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: 2040"
"To calculate the total square feet of fabric used for the quilt, we need to calculate the total square feet from each type of shirt and add them together.

First, let's calculate the total square feet from the small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 11 * 3 = 33 square feet.

Next, we calculate the total square feet from the medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 8 * 4 = 32 square feet.

Lastly, we calculate the total square feet from the large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.

Now, we add the total square feet from each type of shirt: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

The final answer is: 101"
"To determine the total number of sunflower seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can express this as $3 \times 12 = 36$ seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we can multiply 36 by $\frac{1}{2}$, which is $36 \times \frac{1}{2} = 18$. Then, we add this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower: $36 + 18 = 54$ seeds in a large sunflower.

Now, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower to find the total number of seeds: $36 + 54 = 90$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"Given that George has 18 pens, we can determine the number of pens Timothy and Sarah have by applying basic arithmetic operations.

First, we need to find the number of pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, we can express this as a multiplication problem: 3 × 18 = 54. Therefore, Timothy has 54 pens.

Next, we need to find the number of pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can express this as a division problem: 54 ÷ 2 = 27. Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's denote Jackie's height before summer as \(J\), Albert's height as \(A\), and Anne's height as \(N\). We are given that Albert's height is 36 inches, so \(A = 36\).

We also know that Anne's height is twice Albert's height, which can be expressed as \(N = 2A\). Substituting the value of \(A\), we get \(N = 2 \times 36 = 72\).

Furthermore, we are told that Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so we can write an equation: \(J + 2 = N\). Substituting the value of \(N\), we get \(J + 2 = 72\).

To find Jackie's height before summer, we need to solve for \(J\). Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we get \(J = 72 - 2 = 70\).

However, we also know that Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so her current height is \(J + 3\). We can express this as an equation: \(J + 3 = 70\). But we already know that \(J = 70\), so this equation is actually redundant.

To find Jackie's height before summer, we can simply use the equation \(J = 70\), which we derived earlier.

The final answer is: $\boxed{67}$"
"To determine the total revenue from selling the produced chocolate bars, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

First, let's find the total number of bars produced in one week. Since the company produces 5000 bars in a day, we multiply this by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

5000 bars/day × 7 days/week = 35000 bars/week

Now, we need to find the total number of bars produced in two weeks. We multiply the number of bars produced in one week by 2.

35000 bars/week × 2 weeks = 70000 bars

The price per bar is $2. To find the total revenue, we multiply the total number of bars by the price per bar.

70000 bars × $2/bar = $140000

The final answer is: $140000"
"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to consider the discounts on both the T-shirts and the shoes.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a buy one get one 50% off deal, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Let's denote the original price of one T-shirt as P = $8. The cost of the first T-shirt is P, and the cost of the second T-shirt is 0.5P (since it's 50% off). Therefore, the total cost of the T-shirts is P + 0.5P = 1.5P = 1.5 * $8 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 0.4 * $40 = $16. The discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we can find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store by adding the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the number of movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to calculate his total earnings from his allowance and subtract the expenses for the ice cream cones.

Ryan's weekly allowance is $6, and he completed his chores for 3 weeks. Therefore, his total earnings from the allowance are:

6 \* 3 = $18

He then spent $5 on ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, with each cone costing $1.25. The total cost of the ice cream cones is:

4 \* 1.25 = $5

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings to find the remaining amount:

$18 - $5 = $13

With the remaining amount, we can calculate the number of movie tickets Ryan can buy, given that each ticket costs $6.50:

$13 ÷ 6.50 = 2

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

The final answer is: $2"

"To calculate the profit made by Tim from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we need to determine the cost of making one jar and then multiply it by 10.

The cost of making one jar consists of the costs of passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey. 

The cost of passion fruit is 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12.
The cost of jackfruit is 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12.
The cost of honey is 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20.

The total cost of making one jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

The selling price of one jar is $50.

The profit from one jar is $50 - $44 = $6.

To find the profit from 10 jars, we multiply the profit from one jar by 10: $6 * 10 = $60.

"To determine the number of cookies Randy has now, we need to calculate the total number of cookies he had initially and then adjust for the cookies he ate or gave away, and add the cookies he baked.

Let's start by calculating the total number of cookies Randy had initially. We have 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.

Total cookies initially = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18

Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This means he ate 1 oatmeal cookie, 1 chocolate chip cookie, and 1 sugar cookie. So, he ate a total of 3 cookies.

Randy also ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch.

Randy gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends.

Randy then baked 4 of each flavor for dinner. This means he baked 4 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies. So, he baked a total of 12 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has now:

Total cookies initially = 18
Cookies eaten or given away = 3 (snack) + 2 (lunch) + 2 (given away) = 7
Cookies baked = 12

Total cookies now = Total cookies initially - Cookies eaten or given away + Cookies baked
Total cookies now = 18 - 7 + 12

"To determine the total amount Matthew would earn from selling his collection of 12 unique toy soldiers, we need to calculate the earnings from the two halves of the collection separately and then sum them.

Let's denote the number of toy soldiers in each half as n. Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can express this as 2n = 12, where n represents the number of toy soldiers in each half. Solving for n, we get n = 12 / 2 = 6.

Now, we can calculate the earnings from each half. For the first half, Matthew would get 6 toy soldiers * $5 per toy = $30. For the second half, he would get 6 toy soldiers * $7 per toy = $42.

To find the total amount, we add the two amounts together: $30 + $42 = $72.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate was on vacation.

Let's denote the number of holes dug per day as $h_d = 6$ and the number of days Nate was on vacation as $d_v = 14$. The total number of holes dug during this period is given by the product of these two values:

$$\text{Total holes dug} = h_d \times d_v = 6 \times 14 = 84$$

However, since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, we need to account for these additional holes. Assuming Nate fills the holes for the same number of days he was on vacation, the total number of holes becomes:

$$\text{Total holes} = \text{Total holes dug} + (h_d \times d_v) = 84 + 84 = 168$$

Now, let's determine the net number of holes filled per day. Nate fills 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. Therefore, the net number of holes filled per day is:

$$\text{Net holes filled per day} = 9 - 6 = 3$$

To find the number of days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day:

$$\text{Days to fill holes} = \frac{\text{Total holes}}{\text{Net holes filled per day}} = \frac{168}{3} = 56$$

Finally, to find the number of weeks, we divide the total days by 7:

$$\text{Weeks to fill holes} = \frac{\text{Days to fill holes}}{7} = \frac{56}{7} = 8$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first determine the average enrollment at Butler High School. Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can express this relationship as a multiplication operation.

Let's denote the average enrollment at Norman High School as N = 4000. The average enrollment at Butler High School can be calculated as:

N_B = (3/4) * N
N_B = (3/4) * 4000
N_B = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School:

ΔN = N - N_B
ΔN = 4000 - 3000
ΔN = 1000

Therefore, the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School is 1000 students.

The final answer is: 1000"

Therefore, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's denote the number of test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes as t, b, and p, respectively. We are given the following information:

1. t = 16
2. t = 8 (Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested)
3. p = 12 (Igor gathered 2 fewer Petri dishes than requested)
4. b = 7 (Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers)
5. t + b + p = 29 (total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench)

We can substitute the values of t and p into the equation:

8 + b + 12 = 29

Now, we can solve for b:

8 + b + 12 = 29
20 + b = 29
b = 29 - 20
b = 9

However, we know that b = 7, so the number of beakers Igor lost is 9 - 7 = 2.

"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. Therefore, the total number of screws needed for each table is 4 legs * 2 screws/leg = 8 screws/table.

Since James is assembling 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 screws/table * 4 tables = 32 screws.

Now, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws James has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over.

"To determine the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the second basket and then add it to the number of eggs in the first basket.

Since the second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first basket, and the first basket has 10 eggs, we can express this relationship as an equation: 

Let x be the number of eggs in the first basket. Then, the number of eggs in the second basket is 2x.

Given that x = 10, we can substitute this value into the equation to find the number of eggs in the second basket: 2x = 2(10) = 20 eggs.

Now, we can find the total number of eggs in both baskets by adding the number of eggs in the first basket (10) to the number of eggs in the second basket (20): 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

The final answer is: 30"
"To calculate the total amount of money raised by the girls, we need to determine the individual contributions of each girl and then sum them.

Let's denote the amount raised by Alexandra as A. Since Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, we can express Kim's contribution as A + $320.

Given that Alexandra raises $430, we can substitute this value into the expression for Kim's contribution: A + $320 = $430. Solving for A, we get A = $430 - $320 = $110.

Now, we know that Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. Therefore, Maryam's contribution can be expressed as $300 + $400 = $700.

To find the total amount raised, we add the contributions of all the girls: (A + $320) + A + $700 + $300 = $110 + $320 + $700 + $300 = $1430 + $320 = $1750.

However, this is not the correct total. We need to recalculate the total by adding the contributions of Alexandra and Kim correctly: $430 + $750 = $1180. Then, we add Maryam's and Sarah's contributions: $1180 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Given the problem, let's denote the time it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile as V and the time it takes Aaron to run 1 mile as A. We are given that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so we can express this relationship as:

A = 2V

We are also given that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, which means if Aaron runs 1 mile, Vanessa runs 2 miles. Since Aaron runs 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can set up the equation:

2A = 16

Substituting A = 2V into the equation, we get:

2(2V) = 16

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4V = 16

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

V = 4

Therefore, it takes Vanessa 4 minutes to run 1 mile. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, the total time it took her to complete her part of the race is:

4V = 4 * 4 = 16 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs to buy, we must first calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. This can be done by multiplying the length of the dock by the ratio of line to dock length, which is 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.

Let's denote the total amount of line required as L. We can express this as:

L = 3 * 200

Using the order of operations, we first multiply 3 by 200:

L = 3 * 200
L = 600

Now, we need to subtract the amount of line the caretaker already has, which is 6 feet, from the total amount required:

L = 600 - 6
L = 594

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To determine the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue. Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, and each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. The total cost per reservation is:

2 meals * $5 = $10
Adding the $5 bottle of wine, the total cost per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since they get 6 reservations a night, the daily revenue is:

6 reservations * $15 per reservation = $90

Now, we need to calculate the weekly revenue. Tom's restaurant is open 2 days a week. Therefore, the weekly revenue is:

$90 * 2 = $180

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons and then divide it by the number of watermelons.

Given that the profit percentage is 25%, the selling price is 125% of the cost price. 

Let's denote the cost price of 1 watermelon as 'x'. The total cost price of 50 watermelons is $80, so we can write the equation as 50x = 80.

Solving for x, we get x = 80 / 50 = $1.60.

Now, let's find the selling price of 1 watermelon. The selling price is 125% of the cost price, which is 1.25x. 

Substituting the value of x, we get the selling price of 1 watermelon as 1.25 * 1.60 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Given that James is twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years, we can express Dora's current age as $D$. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, we have the equation $D + 3 = 12$. Solving for $D$, we get $D = 9$.

Now, we know that James is twice as old as Dora, so James' current age is $2D = 2(9) = 18$.

However, the problem statement also mentions that John had James when he was 19. This implies that the time elapsed since John had James is $18 - 19 = -1$ year. Since age cannot be negative, this is a contradiction, indicating that the initial information given is inconsistent.

However, if we ignore the inconsistency and continue with the problem, we can find the current age of John's youngest son. Let $J$ be the current age of John's youngest son. We know that John was 32 when his youngest son was born, so we can express this as the equation $J = 32$. In 3 years, his age will be $J + 3 = 32 + 3 = 35$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after an hour, we need to calculate their respective rates of peeling oranges and then find the difference.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so her peeling rate is 1 orange / 3 minutes. To find out how many oranges she can peel in 60 minutes, we can use the unit conversion factor of 60 minutes / 1 hour. This can be expressed as:

(1 hour) × (60 minutes / 1 hour) = 60 minutes

Now, we can multiply Ana's peeling rate by the time in minutes to find the number of oranges she can peel in an hour:

(1 orange / 3 minutes) × (60 minutes) = 20 oranges

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so her peeling rate is 1 orange / 4 minutes. To find out how many oranges she can peel in 60 minutes, we can use the same unit conversion factor:

(1 hour) × (60 minutes / 1 hour) = 60 minutes

Now, we can multiply Jane's peeling rate by the time in minutes to find the number of oranges she can peel in an hour:

(1 orange / 4 minutes) × (60 minutes) = 15 oranges

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"When it comes to calculating the total cost of a new radiator, it's essential to consider the discount and labor costs separately. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the 80% discount. The original cost is $400, and the discount is 80% of that amount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original cost by the discount percentage: 400 * 0.8 = $320. Subtracting the discount from the original cost gives us the discounted price: 400 - 320 = $80.

Next, we need to calculate the labor cost. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 per hour, so the labor cost is 3 * 50 = $150.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the discounted price of the radiator and the labor cost: 80 + 150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Given that Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows, and they have a total of 70 legs, we can set up a system of linear equations to solve for the number of chickens.

Let C represent the number of chickens and W represent the number of cows. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

To solve for C, we can use the substitution method. From the first equation, we can express W in terms of C:

W = 20 - C

Substituting this expression for W into the second equation, we get:

2C + 4(20 - C) = 70

Expanding the equation, we get:

2C + 80 - 4C = 70

Combine like terms:

-2C + 80 = 70

Subtract 80 from both sides:

-2C = -10

Divide both sides by -2:

C = 5

Therefore, the number of chickens is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"When distributing 7 pizzas, each cut into 8 slices, among 4 individuals, we need to determine the number of slices per person. This is a straightforward division problem.

To find the total number of slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza: 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find the number of slices per person: 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person.

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
