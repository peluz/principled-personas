"To determine Janet's daily earnings from selling eggs at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she has available for sale after accounting for her personal consumption and baking.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking, resulting in a total of 7 eggs being utilized. 

The number of eggs available for sale can be calculated as follows:

Eggs laid per day = 16
Eggs used per day = 3 (breakfast) + 4 (baking) = 7
Eggs available for sale = Eggs laid per day - Eggs used per day = 16 - 7 = 9

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. Therefore, her daily earnings from selling eggs at the farmers' market can be calculated as follows:

Daily earnings = Number of eggs available for sale × Price per egg
= 9 eggs × $2/egg
= $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to consider the amount of blue and white fiber needed. The problem states that the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber. 

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Let B = blue fiber bolts
W = white fiber bolts

Given that B = 2, we can find W by dividing B by 2:

W = B / 2
W = 2 / 2
W = 1

Now, we can find the total number of bolts by adding B and W:

Total bolts = B + W
Total bolts = 2 + 1
Total bolts = 3

Therefore, the total number of bolts required for the robe is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs and then subtract the total cost from it.

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh invested $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value, we can use the formula:

New value = Original value + (Original value * 150%)
New value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

The total cost of the house is the sum of the original price and the repairs:
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000 from flipping the house.

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To determine the total distance James covers in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he covers in a single sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Given that James runs 3 sprints in a session, with each sprint being 60 meters, the total distance covered in a session is calculated as follows:

Distance per session = Number of sprints × Distance per sprint
= 3 sprints × 60 meters/sprint
= 3 × 60
= 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total distance he covers in a week is:

Total distance per week = Distance per session × Number of sessions per week
= 180 meters/session × 3 sessions/week
= 180 × 3
= 540 meters/week

Therefore, James covers a total distance of 540 meters in a week."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we must first calculate the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon. 

Let's denote the number of cups of feed given in the morning as $M$ and the number of cups of feed given in the afternoon as $A$. We are given that $M = 15$ and $A = 25$. The total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon is $M + A = 15 + 25 = 40$ cups.

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is $3 \times 20 = 60$ cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: $60 - 40 = 20$ cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total cost of the glasses, we can use a geometric series formula. The cost of the first glass is $5, and the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous one. This forms a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 0.6.

The formula for the sum of a geometric series is:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = $5, r = 0.6, and n = 16.

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = $5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6)

S = $5 * (1 - 0.00006103515625) / 0.4

S = $5 * 0.99993896484375 / 0.4

S = $5 * 2.49964246171875

S ≈ $12.49761230859

However, this is the sum of the costs of the glasses, excluding the first one. To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the first glass:

Total cost = $5 + $12.49761230859

Total cost ≈ $17.49761230859

Rounded to two decimal places, the total cost is approximately $17.50.

The final answer is: $17.50"
"Given the problem, we can establish a linear relationship between the number of sheep in each city. Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as S, Charleston as C, and Toulouse as T. We are given that:

1. T = 2C (Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston)
2. C = 4S (Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle)
3. S = 20 (Seattle has 20 sheep)

We can substitute the value of S into the equation for C:
C = 4S
C = 4(20)
C = 80

Now, we can substitute the value of C into the equation for T:
T = 2C
T = 2(80)
T = 160

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
Total = T + C + S
Total = 160 + 80 + 20
Total = 260

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To determine the total time it takes to download the file, we need to consider the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. We can express this as a fraction of the total file size:

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 × 200 GB = 80 GB

The download rate is given as 2 GB/minute. Therefore, the time it takes to download 80 GB is:

t1 = 80 GB / (2 GB/minute) = 40 minutes

Next, we need to account for the time it takes to install the updates, which is given as 20 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:

60% of 200 GB = 0.6 × 200 GB = 120 GB

The time it takes to download 120 GB is:

t2 = 120 GB / (2 GB/minute) = 60 minutes

The total time it takes to download the file is the sum of the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:

t_total = t1 + 20 minutes + t2
= 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes
= 120 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in each segment of his trip and then subtract the total distance from the initial distance.

Let's break down the problem into segments:

1. Distance traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:
The distance traveled is given by the formula $d = rt$, where $r$ is the rate (speed) and $t$ is the time. In this case, $r = 60$ mph and $t = 3$ hours.

$$d_1 = 60 \cdot 3 = 180 \text{ miles}$$

2. Distance traveled in the first 2 hours of the return trip in standstill traffic:
Since John is not moving, the distance traveled is 0 miles.

3. Distance traveled in the next half-hour at 30 mph:
Using the same formula, we have $r = 30$ mph and $t = 0.5$ hours.

$$d_2 = 30 \cdot 0.5 = 15 \text{ miles}$$

4. Distance traveled in the remaining 2 hours of the return trip at 80 mph:
Again, using the same formula, we have $r = 80$ mph and $t = 2$ hours.

$$d_3 = 80 \cdot 2 = 160 \text{ miles}$$

The total distance traveled in the return trip is the sum of $d_2$ and $d_3$:

$$d_{\text{return}} = d_2 + d_3 = 15 + 160 = 175 \text{ miles}$$

The initial distance from home is the distance traveled in the first 3 hours, which is 180 miles. The total distance traveled is the sum of the distance traveled in the first 3 hours and the return trip:

$$d_{\text{total}} = d_1 + d_{\text{return}} = 180 + 175 = 355 \text{ miles}$$

Since John is now back home, the distance he is from home is 0 miles.

However, if we are looking for the distance from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to consider the distance he has traveled in the 4 hours. 

The distance traveled in the first 3 hours is 180 miles. The distance traveled in the return trip is 175 miles. The total distance traveled in 4 hours is the sum of these two distances:

$$d_{\text{4 hours}} = d_1 + d_{\text{return}} = 180 + 175 = 355 \text{ miles}$$

The distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours is 0 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$"
"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours. 

For the first 40 hours, her earnings can be calculated as follows:

Earnings for the first 40 hours = 40 \* $10 = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 \* $10 = $12 per hour. So, her earnings for the overtime hours are:

Earnings for the overtime hours = 5 \* $12 = $60

Her total earnings for the week are the sum of her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:

Total earnings = Earnings for the first 40 hours + Earnings for the overtime hours
= $400 + $60
= $460

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we can break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that the program had 60 downloads in the first month. 

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, which is a straightforward multiplication: 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

Now, let's consider the third month. The downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this reduction, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. This can be expressed as:

180 - (0.30 * 180)

To calculate 30% of 180, we multiply 0.30 by 180:

0.30 * 180 = 54

Now, we subtract 54 from 180 to find the number of downloads in the third month:

180 - 54 = 126

Now that we have the number of downloads for each month, we can find the total by adding them together:

60 + 180 + 126 = 366

Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366.

The final answer is: $\boxed{366}$"
"To determine the total cost of the pastries Toula purchased, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts. Since Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen, the total cost of the donuts is 3 × $68 = $204.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. Toula purchased 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen, so the total cost of the mini cupcakes is 2 × $80 = $160.

Lastly, we calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes. Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen, so the total cost of the mini cheesecakes is 6 × $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together to find the total cost: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost of the pastries Toula purchased is $694."
"To determine the number of years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the break-even point, which is the point at which the total revenue equals the total cost.

Let's denote the number of years as \(y\). The total cost of the tree is $90, which is a fixed cost. The revenue generated each year is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year. The cost to maintain the tree each year is $3.

The total revenue after \(y\) years is $10.5\(y\), and the total cost is $90 + $3\(y\). To find the break-even point, we set the total revenue equal to the total cost:

$$
10.5y = 90 + 3y
$$

Subtracting 3\(y\) from both sides gives:

$$
7.5y = 90
$$

Dividing both sides by 7.5 gives:

$$
y = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
$$

Therefore, it will take 12 years for the tree to pay for itself, but it will start generating revenue in the first year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as x.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which can be represented as $\frac{x}{3}$. After this sale, she had $\frac{2x}{3}$ vacuum cleaners left.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners, leaving her with $\frac{2x}{3} - 2$ vacuum cleaners.

Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. This can be represented as $\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2x}{3} - 2\right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1$.

We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

$$\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5$$

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation:

$$\frac{x}{3} = 6$$

Multiplying both sides by 3 gives us:

$$x = 18$$

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can use a step-by-step approach.

First, we calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 20% of the total number of students:
\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find the number of remaining students, which is the total number of students minus the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Then, we calculate the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25% of the remaining students:
\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we can find the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students:
\[ 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the optimal investment choice, we need to calculate the expected increase in value for each option. 

Let's denote the initial price of the jewelry as $5,000 and the initial price of the electronic gadgets as $8,000. The market is expected to rise by 2.5% for jewelry and 1.2% for electronic gadgets.

The increase in value for the jewelry can be calculated as follows:
ΔJ = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125

The increase in value for the electronic gadgets can be calculated as follows:
ΔE = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Since the increase in value for the jewelry ($125) is greater than the increase in value for the electronic gadgets ($96), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125.

The final numerical answer is: $125"
"Given the scenario, we have two trains traveling in a two-dimensional plane, with their paths forming a right-angled triangle. The westward journey of 80 miles and the northward journey of 150 miles can be treated as the legs of a right-angled triangle.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b):

c² = a² + b²

where a = 80 miles (westward journey) and b = 150 miles (northward journey).

c² = 80² + 150²
c² = 6400 + 22500
c² = 28900

Now, we take the square root of both sides to find the value of c:

c = √28900
c = 170 miles

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 170 miles."
"To determine Jill's annual salary, we can calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then sum them to obtain her total annual compensation.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching. We know that Jill is paid $20 per hour and works 35 hours per week for 50 weeks per year. The total hours worked per year can be calculated as follows:

Total hours worked per year = hours worked per week * weeks worked per year
= 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year
= 1750 hours/year

Now, we can calculate her annual earnings from teaching by multiplying her hourly wage by the total hours worked per year:

Annual earnings from teaching = hourly wage * total hours worked per year
= $20/hour * 1750 hours/year
= $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching. We know that Jill is paid $30 per hour and works 15 hours per week for 50 weeks per year. The total hours worked per year can be calculated as follows:

Total hours worked per year = hours worked per week * weeks worked per year
= 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year
= 750 hours/year

Now, we can calculate her annual earnings from coaching by multiplying her hourly wage by the total hours worked per year:

Annual earnings from coaching = hourly wage * total hours worked per year
= $30/hour * 750 hours/year
= $22,500/year

Finally, we can calculate her total annual salary by summing her earnings from teaching and coaching:

Total annual salary = annual earnings from teaching + annual earnings from coaching
= $35,000/year + $22,500/year
= $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in that time frame. Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, we can calculate the total number of eggs by multiplying the number of eggs per omelet by the number of days in 4 weeks.

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

The number of eggs Claire eats per day is 3, so in 28 days, she will consume 3 * 28 = 84 eggs.

To find the number of dozens of eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen.

$$\frac{84}{12} = 7$$

Therefore, Claire will consume 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of average speed and the formula for average speed, which is total distance divided by total time. Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike. 

First, let's find the total time she needs to complete the hike:

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Since she has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time

We know the remaining distance (6 miles) and the remaining time (1 hour), so we can plug these values into the formula:

Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink, and then subtract the amount of water in the 1 liter of orange drink that was spilled.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the orange drink. Since it is two-thirds water, we can express this as a decimal: 2/3 = 0.67. Therefore, the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 0.67 * 10 = 6.7 liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Since it is three-fifths water, we can express this as a decimal: 3/5 = 0.6. Therefore, the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 0.6 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the original mixture. This is the sum of the water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 6.7 + 9 = 15.7 liters.

Since 1 liter of the orange drink was spilled, we need to subtract the amount of water in this 1 liter from the total amount of water: 15.7 - 0.67 = 15.03 liters.

However, we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. To do this, we need to find the amount of water in the 9 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink and the pineapple drink. Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 9 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is 1/3 * 9 = 3 liters. Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the 9 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is 2/5 * 9 = 3.6 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the sum of the water in the original mixture and the water in the non-water liquid in the orange and pineapple drinks: 15.03 + 3 + 3.6 = 21.63 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21.63}$"
"To determine the number of years that have passed since Raymond's son was born, we need to first calculate Raymond's current age. Given that Samantha is 31 years old and Raymond was born 6 years before her, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:

Let $R$ represent Raymond's current age. Then, we have the equation:

R = 31 - 6
R = 25

Now that we know Raymond is 25 years old, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since he had a son. Let $t$ represent the number of years since Raymond's son was born. Since Raymond had a son at the age of 23, we can set up the equation:

R = 23 + t
25 = 23 + t

Subtracting 23 from both sides of the equation, we get:

2 = t

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday, we can break down the sales into two distinct groups: the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers each purchased 1 DVD, resulting in a total of 3 \* 1 = 3 DVDs sold to this group.

The next 2 customers each purchased 2 DVDs, resulting in a total of 2 \* 2 = 4 DVDs sold to this group.

To find the total number of DVDs sold, we can add the number of DVDs sold to each group: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"To determine the total reduction in the candle's length, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. 

The rate at which the candle melts is 2 centimeters per hour.

Total melting = rate * time
Total melting = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
Total melting = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To determine the original price of the book, we can use the concept of percentage decrease. The discounted price is $19.50, and it represents 75% of the original price, since the discount is 25%. 

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

Discounted price = Original price - (Discount percentage × Original price)
19.50 = x - (0.25x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

19.50 = 0.75x

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

Therefore, the original price of the book is $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of pizza boxes as x.

The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + 5 \times 3 + 4 \times 1.50 = 12 + 15 + 6 = 33$ dollars.

The total cost of the pizza boxes can be represented as 8.50x, where x is the number of boxes.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, we can set up the equation:

12 + 15 + 6 + 8.50x = 50

Combine like terms:

33 + 8.50x = 50

Subtract 33 from both sides:

8.50x = 17

Divide both sides by 8.50:

x = 17 / 8.50
x = 2

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on the clothing items, we can calculate the cost of each item and then sum them together. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts: 3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 each is given by the expression 3 × $16.50. Using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can rewrite this as 3 × $16 + 3 × $0.50. Multiplying 3 by $16 yields $48, and multiplying 3 by $0.50 yields $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of the shorts is $48 + $1.50 = $49.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the pants: 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each is given by the expression 3 × $22.50. Using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can rewrite this as 3 × $20 + 3 × $2.50. Multiplying 3 by $20 yields $60, and multiplying 3 by $2.50 yields $7.50. Therefore, the total cost of the pants is $60 + $7.50 = $67.50.

Finally, we calculate the cost of the shoes: 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each is given by the expression 3 × $42. Multiplying 3 by $42 yields $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The final answer is: $243"
"To determine the total cost of ice cream Cynthia will spend over 60 days, we need to calculate the number of cartons she will purchase and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Given that each carton contains 15 servings and Cynthia consumes one serving per night, we can calculate the total number of cartons required as follows:

Number of cartons = Total number of servings / Servings per carton
= 60 days × 1 serving/day
= 60

Since each carton contains 15 servings, we can calculate the number of cartons as:

Number of cartons = 60 / 15
= 4

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

Total cost = Number of cartons × Cost per carton
= 4 × $4.00
= $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream over 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To determine the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to understand the spatial relationship between the two stops. Given that the first stop occurred after 20 miles and the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, we can visualize the situation as a linear distance.

Let's denote the total distance of the trip as $d = 60$ miles. The distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is $d_1 = 20$ miles, and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip is $d_2 = 60 - 15 = 45$ miles.

The distance between the first and second stops can be calculated by finding the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip.

$d_{\text{between stops}} = d_1 - d_2 = 20 - 45$

However, this calculation is incorrect because it assumes that the first stop is after the second stop, which is not the case. To find the correct distance, we need to consider the distance from the first stop to the second stop.

Since the second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip, we can calculate the distance from the first stop to the second stop by subtracting the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip.

$d_{\text{between stops}} = d_1 - (d - d_2) = 20 - (60 - 45) = 20 - 15 = 5$

However, this is still incorrect. We need to consider the correct relationship between the two stops. The correct approach is to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop by subtracting the distance from the second stop to the first stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip.

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of the boots as B and the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as H. We are given that the cost of the less expensive pair of heels is $33, and the more expensive pair costs twice as much, so H = 2 * 33 = $66.

We are also given that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. This can be expressed as an equation: B = 33 + 66 - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

Therefore, the cost of the boots is $94.

The final answer is: $94"
"Given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11, we can express their ages as 7x and 11x, respectively, where x is a common multiplier. The total of their ages is 162, which can be represented by the equation 7x + 11x = 162.

Combining like terms, we obtain 18x = 162. To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 18, yielding x = 162/18 = 9.

Now that we have determined the value of x, we can calculate Allen's current age by substituting x into the expression 11x, resulting in 11(9) = 99.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age, giving us 99 + 10 = 109.

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide by the number of people. Let's denote the first person's guess as $x = 80$ jelly beans.

The second person's guess is 20 more than half of the first one, which can be expressed as $\frac{x}{2} + 20$. Substituting the value of $x$, we get $\frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60$.

The third person's guess is 25% more than the first one, which can be calculated as $x + 0.25x = 1.25x$. Substituting the value of $x$, we get $80 + 0.25(80) = 80 + 20 = 100$.

Now, we can find the total number of guesses by adding the individual guesses: $x + \left(\frac{x}{2} + 20\right) + (1.25x) = 80 + 60 + 100 = 240$.

There are 3 people, so to find the average guess, we divide the total number of guesses by the number of people: $\frac{240}{3} = 80$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we can apply the concept of time management and multiplication. 

First, we need to calculate the total time spent on dogs per day. This can be done by multiplying the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog.

Number of dogs (n) = 10
Time per dog (t) = 0.5 hours

Total time per day = n * t
Total time per day = 10 * 0.5
Total time per day = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total time spent in a week by multiplying the total time per day by 7.

Total time per week = Total time per day * 7
Total time per week = 5 * 7
Total time per week = 35 hours

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of his dogs.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We are given that G = S + 30 and S + G = 110.

We can rewrite the second equation as S + (S + 30) = 110, which simplifies to 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtracting 30 from both sides yields 2S = 80.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the number of jewels Siobhan possesses, we can establish a series of relationships between the individuals involved. 

Let's denote the number of jewels Raymond has as R, the number of jewels Aaron has as A, and the number of jewels Siobhan has as S. 

Given that Raymond has 40 jewels, we can express this as R = 40.

We are also told that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. This can be represented as A = (1/2)R + 5. Substituting the value of R, we get A = (1/2)(40) + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25.

Lastly, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. This can be expressed as S = A - 2. Substituting the value of A, we get S = 25 - 2 = 23.

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the total points scored by Mike in the ping pong game, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. 

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To calculate this, we can use the formula for percentage increase: 

25% increase = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total expenditure on yogurt over a 30-day period, we first need to calculate the number of yogurt sets Terry purchases. Given that he consumes 2 yogurts per day, the total number of yogurts consumed in 30 days is 2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts.

Since the yogurts are sold in sets of 4 for $5.00, we can calculate the number of sets by dividing the total number of yogurts by the number of yogurts per set: 60 yogurts / 4 yogurts/set = 15 sets.

Now, we can calculate the total expenditure by multiplying the number of sets by the cost per set: 15 sets * $5.00/set = $75.00.

Therefore, the total expenditure on yogurt over 30 days is $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To determine the number of Lego sets John has left, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money.

Let's denote the number of Lego sets John sold as $n$. Since he sells each Lego set for $15, the total revenue from selling the Lego sets is $15n$. 

We know that John ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is $20 \times 8 = 160$ dollars. He also has $5 left, so the total amount of money he spent is $15n - 5$.

The total amount of money John made from selling the Lego sets is equal to the cost of the video games and the remaining money, so we can set up the equation:

$$15n = 160 + 5$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$15n = 165$$

Now, we can solve for $n$:

$$n = \frac{165}{15}$$

$$n = 11$$

This means John sold 11 Lego sets with the money from the Lego sales. Since he initially had 13 Lego sets, we can find the number of Lego sets he has left by subtracting the number of sets he sold:

$$13 - 11 = 2$$

Therefore, John still has 2 Lego sets left."
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

Let's break down John's running schedule:

- Day 1: 3 hours
- Day 2 and Day 3: 1.5 hours each

Total running time per week = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we need to multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time.
Total weekly running time = 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.
Speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour

Therefore, John's running speed is 3.33 miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"To solve this problem, we can apply the concept of unit rates and time-distance relationships. Let's denote Dana's walking speed as $w$, her running speed as $r$, and her skipping speed as $s$. We are given that $s = 3$ miles per hour and $r = 4w$. 

Since we know that $s = \frac{1}{2}r$, we can substitute $r = 4w$ into this equation to get $3 = \frac{1}{2}(4w)$, which simplifies to $w = \frac{3}{2}$ miles per hour.

Now, let's consider the time-distance relationship. Dana spends $\frac{1}{3}$ of the time running and $\frac{2}{3}$ of the time walking. Given that the total time is 6 hours, the time spent running is $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 6 = 2$ hours, and the time spent walking is $\frac{2}{3} \cdot 6 = 4$ hours.

The distance traveled while walking is given by the product of the walking speed and the time spent walking, which is $w \cdot 4 = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 4 = 6$ miles. Similarly, the distance traveled while running is $r \cdot 2 = 4w \cdot 2 = 4 \cdot \frac{3}{2} = 6$ miles.

The total distance traveled in 6 hours is the sum of the distances traveled while walking and running, which is $6 + 6 = 12$ miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a linear relationship between the ages of the iPhones. Let's denote Suzy's iPhone age as S, Ben's iPhone age as B, and Brandon's iPhone age as Br.

From the information provided, we have the following equations:

1. B = 2S (Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone)
2. Br = 4B (Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone)

We are given that S = 1 (Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old). Substituting this value into equation 1, we get:

B = 2(1) = 2

Now, we can substitute the value of B into equation 2 to find Br:

Br = 4(2) = 8

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while still hitting it with the gold javelin, we need to consider the increased range provided by the sapphire gemstone.

Let's denote the original range of the javelin as $d_0 = 400$ feet. When Polly holds the gemstone, her range increases by a factor of 3, so the new range is $d = 3d_0 = 3(400) = 1200$ feet.

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet, so Polly can stand at a distance of 1000 feet from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin. To find the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames, we subtract the dragon's range from Polly's new range:

$d_{\text{outside}} = d - 1000 = 1200 - 1000 = 200$ feet

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit it with the gold javelin.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of pieces of pie taken by the guests, we can employ a basic arithmetic operation. Given that Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces, we can calculate the total number of pieces as follows:

Total number of pieces = Number of pies × Number of pieces per pie
= 5 × 8
= 40

Since there were 14 pieces remaining at the end of the evening, we can find the number of pieces taken by subtracting the remaining pieces from the total:

Number of pieces taken = Total number of pieces - Remaining pieces
= 40 - 14
= 26

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the maximum amount of chips that can be consumed, we first need to calculate the remaining daily calorie allowance. Given a daily target of 2000 calories and a current consumption of 1800 calories, the remaining calories can be calculated as follows:

Remaining calories = Daily target - Current consumption
Remaining calories = 2000 - 1800
Remaining calories = 200 calories

Next, we need to find out how many servings of chips can be consumed within this remaining calorie allowance. Each serving of chips contains 250 calories. Therefore, the number of servings that can be consumed is:

Number of servings = Remaining calories / Calories per serving
Number of servings = 200 / 250
Number of servings = 0.8

Since a 300g bag of chips contains 5 servings, we can now calculate the maximum weight of chips that can be consumed:

Maximum weight = Number of servings * Weight per serving
Maximum weight = 0.8 * 300g
Maximum weight = 240g

Therefore, the maximum weight of chips that can be consumed is 240g.

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To determine Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost associated with producing and selling 20 candles.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. The price per candle is $2.00, and Charlie sells 20 candles. Therefore, the total revenue is given by:

Total revenue = Number of candles sold × Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 × $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. The cost of supplies for 20 candles includes the cost of 2 pounds of beeswax, as 1 pound of beeswax is required to make 10 candles. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is:

Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax = Cost per pound × Number of pounds
Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax = $10.00/pound × 2
Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax = $20.00

Additionally, we need to consider the cost of the wicks, which is also $10.00. Therefore, the total cost is:

Total cost = Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax + Cost of wicks
Total cost = $20.00 + $10.00
Total cost = $30.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $30.00
Net profit = $10.00

The final answer is: $10.00"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

Let's start by calculating the number of articles Meredith wrote on each day. On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This can be expressed as:

Tuesday's articles = 5 + (2/5 * 5)
= 5 + 2
= 7 articles

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday:

Wednesday's articles = 2 * 7
= 14 articles

Now, we can find the total number of articles written in 3 days by adding the number of articles written each day:

Total articles = 5 + 7 + 14
= 26 articles

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:

Total hours = 26 articles * 4 hours/article
= 104 hours

The final answer is: 104"
"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. At work, she used 220 Post-it notes, and she had 23 remaining. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes after purchasing the package can be expressed as:

80 (initial) + x (package) - 220 (used) + 23 (remaining)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 23 = 80 + 220 - 23

Combine like terms:

x + 23 = 277 - 23

Subtract 23 from both sides:

x = 254

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 254.

The final answer is: $\boxed{254}$"
"Given that John purchases twice as many red ties as blue ties and the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, we can approach this problem by first determining the number of blue ties and the cost of each red tie.

Let's denote the number of blue ties as B and the cost of each blue tie as $40. We are given that John spent $200 on blue ties, so we can express this as:

B \* 40 = 200

Solving for B, we get:

B = 200 / 40
B = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2B = 2(5) = 10.

Now, let's consider the cost of each red tie. We are told that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. This means the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie, or 1.5(40) = $60.

The total cost of the red ties is then 10(60) = $600.

To find the total amount spent on ties, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties:

Total cost = 200 + 600
Total cost = $800

Therefore, John spent a total of $800 on ties.

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the number of pieces Tracy obtained from the wire, we first need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, as the pieces are cut to a length of 6 inches. 

Since 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches, we can calculate the total length of the wire in inches as follows:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces obtained:

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces from the wire.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building. Given that there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, we can find the total number of units by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor:

Total units = Number of floors × Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 × 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can find the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units by 3/4:

Occupied units = Total units × 3/4
Occupied units = 120 × 3/4
Occupied units = 90

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Unoccupied units = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine Lloyd's weekly revenue from egg sales, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then convert this quantity to dozens, as eggs are typically sold in this unit.

First, we calculate the total number of eggs produced per week by multiplying the daily egg production by the number of days in a week:

$$\text{Eggs per week} = 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week}$$

Since eggs are sold in dozens, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12:

$$\text{Dozens per week} = \frac{1764 \text{ eggs/week}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozen eggs/week}$$

Now, we can calculate Lloyd's weekly revenue by multiplying the number of dozens by the price per dozen:

$$\text{Weekly revenue} = 147 \text{ dozen eggs/week} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$294/\text{week}$$

The final answer is: $294"
"To determine the total time Tom spent traveling, we need to calculate the time he spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM and the time he spent traveling back.

First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he traveled for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, we need to find the time it took to travel 30 miles at a speed of 10 miles per hour. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 10 miles/hour
Time = 3 hours

Next, we need to find the time it took to travel back. The distance is the same, 30 miles, but the speed is now 6 miles per hour. We can use the same formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The total time Tom spent traveling is the sum of the time spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM and the time spent traveling back:

Total Time = 3 hours + 5 hours
Total Time = 8 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of toys Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we can approach this problem by first calculating the total weight of the comic books he removed. Given that each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

$$\frac{1}{4} \times 30 = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}.$$

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is:

$$15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}.$$

Now, we can calculate the number of toys to be removed by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy, which is 1/2 pound. This can be expressed as:

$$\frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15.$$

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the revenue earned by the mechanic, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately for both Thursday and Friday.

Let's denote the number of truck tires repaired on Thursday as $t_{Thursday}$ and the number of car tires repaired on Thursday as $c_{Thursday}$. Similarly, let's denote the number of car tires repaired on Friday as $c_{Friday}$. We are given that $t_{Thursday} = 6$ and $c_{Thursday} = 4$, while $c_{Friday} = 12$ and $t_{Friday} = 0$.

The revenue from truck tires on Thursday is given by $60t_{Thursday}$, and the revenue from car tires on Thursday is given by $40c_{Thursday}$. Therefore, the total revenue on Thursday is $60t_{Thursday} + 40c_{Thursday} = 60(6) + 40(4) = 360 + 160 = 520$.

The revenue from car tires on Friday is given by $40c_{Friday} = 40(12) = 480$.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday. Since $520 > 480$, Thursday is the day with higher revenue.

To find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue: $520 - 480 = 40$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to calculate the number of kittens from the adopted kittens and the new kittens from the two house cats.

Let's denote the number of adopted kittens as A = 7. According to the problem, Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which can be expressed as 3A. Therefore, the number of kittens from Patchy is 3A = 3(7) = 21.

Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

To find the total number of kittens, we add the number of adopted kittens, the kittens from Patchy, and the kittens from Trixie: A + 3A + 12 = 7 + 21 + 12.

Performing the arithmetic, we get: 7 + 21 + 12 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the number of bags Jean can fill with the remaining lollipops, we need to perform a simple division operation. 

First, we calculate the number of lollipops remaining after Jean eats 2:
30 (initial lollipops) - 2 (lollipops eaten) = 28 lollipops

Next, we divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags Jean can fill:
$$\frac{28}{2} = 14$$

Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the maximum number of trips he can afford given his budget of $42 and the cost of a single trip, which includes a ticket for $7 and popcorn for $7, totaling $14.

Let's denote the number of trips as 'n'. The total cost of 'n' trips is given by the equation:

Total Cost = Cost per Trip * Number of Trips
Total Cost = 14n

Since Peter has a budget of $42, we can set up the inequality:

14n ≤ 42

To find the maximum number of trips Peter can afford, we need to solve for 'n':

n ≤ 42 / 14
n ≤ 3

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies at most 3 times."
"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach.

Given:
- Weight limit of the bridge: 5000 pounds
- Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck: 3755 pounds
- Weight of each box: 15 pounds

First, we calculate the maximum weight allowed on the truck by subtracting the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit:

$$\text{Maximum weight allowed on the truck} = \text{Weight limit of the bridge} - \text{Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck}$$

$$\text{Maximum weight allowed on the truck} = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}$$

Next, we determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck by dividing the maximum weight allowed on the truck by the weight of each box:

$$\text{Maximum number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Maximum weight allowed on the truck}}{\text{Weight of each box}}$$

$$\text{Maximum number of boxes} = \frac{1245}{15} = 83$$

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

The final answer is: $\boxed{83}$"
"To determine the final price of Stephen's groceries, we must consider the additional fees and tip. The initial bill was $40.00. A 25% fee is then applied to this amount, which can be calculated as follows:

25% of $40.00 = 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00

Adding this fee to the initial bill yields:

$40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

Next, a $3.00 delivery fee is added to the total:

$50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

Finally, a $4.00 tip is added to the total:

$53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To determine the total number of raspberries on the bush, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. The bush contains 6 clusters of raspberries, with each cluster consisting of 20 fruit. We can calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters by multiplying the number of clusters by the number of raspberries per cluster:

6 clusters × 20 raspberries per cluster = 120 raspberries

In addition to the raspberries in the clusters, there are 67 individual raspberries scattered across the bush. To find the total number of raspberries, we can add the number of raspberries in the clusters to the number of individual raspberries:

120 raspberries + 67 raspberries = 187 raspberries

Therefore, the total number of raspberries on the bush is 187."
"To determine the number of good oranges, we first need to calculate the total number of unripe and bad oranges. 

There are 1 bad oranges and 20% of 25 oranges are unripe. We can express this as a decimal by dividing 20 by 100: 20/100 = 0.2. Then, we multiply this decimal by the total number of oranges to find the number of unripe oranges: 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges are unripe.

Now, we add the number of bad and unripe oranges to find the total number of oranges that are not good: 1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) = 6 oranges are not good.

To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges: 25 (total) - 6 (not good) = 19 oranges are good.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to consider the costs associated with the material, the jeweler's services, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500, and the cost of the jeweler's services is $800. To find the total cost before insurance, we add these two amounts together:

$$\text{Total cost before insurance} = \text{Cost of material} + \text{Cost of jeweler} = 500 + 800 = 1300$$

Next, we need to calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of the total cost before insurance. To find 10% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.1:

$$\text{Insurance cost} = 0.1 \times \text{Total cost before insurance} = 0.1 \times 1300 = 130$$

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the total cost before insurance to find the total amount paid:

$$\text{Total amount paid} = \text{Total cost before insurance} + \text{Insurance cost} = 1300 + 130 = 1430$$

Therefore, Janet paid a total of $1430 for the brooch.

The final answer is: $1430"
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to consider the pension structure. For the first 20 years, she receives the standard annual pension of $50,000. After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year for the remaining 10 years.

Let's calculate the value of the pension after 20 years. Since she receives the full pension for 20 years, the total value of the pension is 20 years * $50,000/year = $1,000,000.

After 20 years, she is entitled to 5% of the value of the pension, which is 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000/year.

However, this is not the correct approach. We need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years, considering the 5% increase for the remaining 10 years. The correct approach is to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years as follows:

Let P be the value of the pension after 30 years. We can set up the equation:

P = 20 years * $50,000/year + 10 years * 0.05P

Simplifying the equation, we get:

P = $1,000,000 + 0.5P

Subtracting 0.5P from both sides, we get:

0.5P = $1,000,000

Dividing both sides by 0.5, we get:

P = $2,000,000

However, this is the total value of the pension after 30 years. To find the annual pension, we need to divide the total value by the number of years:

Annual pension = $2,000,000 / 30 years = $66,667/year

The final answer is: $66,667."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to consider the monthly subscription fee and the discount applied to the second half of the year.

The monthly subscription fee is $140. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year consists of 6 months, and the second half consists of the remaining 6 months.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

To find the amount she paid for the second half of the year, we need to calculate 10% less than the initial amount. This can be expressed as 90% of the initial amount, which is 0.9 * $140 = $126.

For the second half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $126 = $756.

The total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

The final answer is: $1596"
"To determine the distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. This can be done by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Given that the car's fuel tank holds 12 gallons, we can now calculate the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity by the mpg rating.

total miles = tank capacity * mpg
total miles = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total miles = 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine the total time spent on TV and reading, we can break down the problem into manageable components. 

First, let's calculate the time spent on TV and reading in one day. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half as long, which is 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour. Therefore, the total time spent on TV and reading in one day is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since this pattern is repeated 7 times a week, we can calculate the total time spent on TV and reading in one week by multiplying the daily time by 7: 3 hours * 7 days = 21 hours.

To find the total time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we can multiply the weekly time by 4: 21 hours * 4 = 84 hours.

The final answer is: 84"

Let's denote the number of diamonds as D, the number of rubies as R, and the number of emeralds as E. We are given that D = 175, R = D - 35, and E = 2R.

First, we calculate the number of rubies: R = D - 35 = 175 - 35 = 140.

Next, we calculate the number of emeralds: E = 2R = 2(140) = 280.

Now, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds: Total gems = D + R + E = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.

The final answer is: $\boxed{595}$"
"Given that there are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school, and there are 60 girls, we can determine the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2. This yields 2 * 60 = 120 boys.

To find the total number of students, we add the number of boys and girls: 60 (girls) + 120 (boys) = 180 students.

Since there are 5 students per teacher, we can calculate the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5.

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
= 180 / 5
= 36

Therefore, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is 36.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the initial amount of money Bailey had, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial amount as 'x'. Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, which totals to $40. At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100.

We can set up the equation as follows:

x + 40 = 100

To solve for 'x', we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."

"To determine the total number of instructions Kelian has to read to prepare the two dishes, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

Let's denote the number of instructions in the first recipe as x. We are given that the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so the number of instructions in the second recipe is 2x.

We know that the first recipe has 20 instructions, so we can set up the equation x = 20.

Now, we can find the number of instructions in the second recipe by substituting the value of x into the expression 2x, which gives us 2 * 20 = 40 instructions.

To find the total number of instructions, we add the number of instructions in both recipes: 20 + 40 = 60.

Therefore, Kelian has to read 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes.

"To determine the monthly payment for Shiela's cell phone installment plan, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones, including the interest charged.

The original price of each cell phone is $150. Since Shiela is purchasing 5 units, the total original price is 5 \* $150 = $750.

The interest rate is 2% per unit, which can be expressed as 0.02. To find the total interest charged, we multiply the interest rate by the original price of each unit and then by the number of units: 0.02 \* $150 \* 5 = $15.

The total cost of the cell phones, including the interest, is $750 + $15 = $765.

To find the monthly payment, we divide the total cost by the number of installments: $765 ÷ 3 = $255.

Therefore, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

Therefore, the total amount Artie will make from his flower stand is $88.

The final answer is: $88"
"To find the average square footage of a level in the sandcastle, we can use the concept of geometric series. The top level has a square footage of 16, and each subsequent level has half the square footage of the previous level. This forms a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 1/2.

The total square footage of the sandcastle can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum of the series, a is the first term (16), r is the common ratio (1/2), and n is the number of terms (4).

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = 16(1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2)
= 16(1 - 1/16) / (1/2)
= 16(15/16) / (1/2)
= 16(15/16)(2)
= 15

Now, to find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

Average = S / n
= 15 / 4
= 3.75

"To determine the total amount of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year. 

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. This can be represented as a simple arithmetic series: 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

For the rest of the year, the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day. Since there are 365 days in a year, and the puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days, the number of days the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food is 365 - 180 = 185 days. Therefore, the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is the sum of the amount eaten in the first 180 days and the amount eaten in the rest of the year: 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can establish a ratio of laundry done by each individual based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of laundry done by David as D, Sarah as S, and Raymond as R.

Given that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can express this as S = 4D. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can substitute this value into the equation to find the amount of laundry done by David:

S = 4D
400 = 4D
D = 400 / 4
D = 100

Now that we know David does 100 pounds of laundry, we can find the amount of laundry done by Raymond, who does half as much laundry as Sarah:

R = S / 2
R = 400 / 2
R = 200

To find the difference in the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David, we subtract the amount done by David from the amount done by Raymond:

Difference = R - D
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the better price for purchasing 18 flowers, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option and compare them.

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is given by the equation:

$$\frac{2.50}{3} = 0.8333 \text{ dollars per flower}.$$

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is given by the equation:

$$\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \text{ dollars per flower}.$$

Since $0.5 \text{ dollars per flower} < 0.8333 \text{ dollars per flower}$, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. Since each package contains 2 flowers, we need 9 packages to obtain 18 flowers. The total cost is given by:

$$9 \times 1 = 9 \text{ dollars}.$$

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers. Since each package contains 3 flowers, we need 6 packages to obtain 18 flowers. The total cost is given by:

$$6 \times 2.50 = 15 \text{ dollars}.$$

The difference in cost is $15 - 9 = 6 \text{ dollars}.$

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the cost of the grooming after the discount, we can apply the concept of percentage reduction. The original price of the grooming service is $100, and the discount offered is 30% off for being a new customer.

The discount amount can be calculated as a percentage of the original price:

Discount amount = (Discount percentage) × (Original price)
= 0.30 × $100
= $30

To find the cost after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the original price:

Cost after discount = Original price - Discount amount
= $100 - $30
= $70

Therefore, the cost of the grooming service after the discount is $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To determine the amount of water left after the girls and the boy have taken their share, we need to calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls and subtract it from the initial amount of water.

First, let's calculate the amount of water taken by the girls. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, we can calculate this as follows:

(1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they got a total of 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Next, we need to account for the amount of water taken by the boy, which is given as 6 liters.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy:
Total water taken = 8 (by girls) + 6 (by boy) = 14 liters

Finally, we can find the amount of water left by subtracting the total water taken from the initial amount of water:
Water left = 24 - 14 = 10 liters

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of stickers Charlie has left, we can apply a straightforward arithmetic approach. Initially, Charlie possessed 10 stickers. Subsequently, he acquired 21 stickers from a store and 23 stickers for his birthday, resulting in a total of 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers.

However, Charlie then engaged in two transactions that reduced his sticker count. Firstly, he gave 9 stickers to his sister, which decreased his total to 54 - 9 = 45 stickers. Secondly, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, further reducing his count to 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Therefore, the number of stickers Charlie has left is 17.

"To determine the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we first need to calculate Alex's weight. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. 

Let's denote Grace's weight as G. We are given that G = 125 pounds. Therefore, Alex's weight can be expressed as 4G - 2. Substituting the value of G, we get Alex's weight as 4(125) - 2 = 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: G + (4G - 2) = 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{623}$"
"To determine the total number of thorns, we can apply the principle of multiplication to calculate the product of the number of rose bushes, the number of roses per bush, and the number of thorns per rose.

Let's denote the number of rose bushes as $B$, the number of roses per bush as $R$, and the number of thorns per rose as $T$. We are given that $B = 3$, $R = 25$, and $T = 8$.

The total number of thorns can be calculated as the product of these three quantities:

$Total\ thorns = B \times R \times T = 3 \times 25 \times 8$

Using the associative property of multiplication, we can rearrange the order of the factors to facilitate the calculation:

$Total\ thorns = (3 \times 25) \times 8 = 75 \times 8$

Now, we can perform the multiplication:

$Total\ thorns = 75 \times 8 = 600$

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of games the team lost as L and the number of games they won as W. We know that W = L + 8 and W + L = 22.

We can rewrite the second equation as L + W = 22. Substituting W from the first equation into the second equation, we get L + (L + 8) = 22.

Combine like terms: 2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2: L = 7

Now that we know L, we can find W: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to calculate the total number of years he has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on per year.

Gene's age range for vacationing is from 23 to 34 years old. To find the total number of years, we subtract the starting age from the ending age: 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene goes on 4 vacations per year, we can calculate the total number of quilt blocks by multiplying the total number of years by the number of vacations per year: 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we can break down the information provided and apply basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the number of times the alarm rang the first time it went off as $a = 4$. The second time it went off, the alarm rang for three times as long as the first time, so the number of times it rang is $3a = 3 \cdot 4 = 12$. The third time it went off, the alarm rang for half as long as the second time, so the number of times it rang is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 12 = 6$.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we can add up the number of times it rang each time: $a + 3a + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3a = 4 + 12 + 6 = 22$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we can apply the concept of compound interest, where the annual increase is the interest rate. In this case, the interest rate is 10% of the current salary, which is compounded annually.

Let's denote the initial salary as $600 and the annual increase as 10% or 0.1. We can use the formula for compound interest to calculate the salary after 5 years:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal amount (initial salary), r is the annual interest rate (10% or 0.1), and n is the number of years.

A = 600(1 + 0.1)^5
A = 600(1.1)^5
A = 600 * 1.61051
A = 966.306

So, Sylvie's salary after 5 years is $966.31.

Now, we need to calculate the salary for the next 3 years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply the increase to the salary after 5 years.

The annual increase is 10% of $966.31, which is 0.1 * 966.31 = $96.631.

We can calculate the salary for the next 3 years by adding the annual increase to the current salary:

Year 6: $966.31 + $96.631 = $1062.941
Year 7: $1062.941 + $106.2941 = $1169.2351
Year 8: $1169.2351 + $116.92351 = $1286.15861
Year 9: $1286.15861 + $128.615861 = $1414.774471

The final answer is: $1414.77"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combining like terms, we get:

11H = 88,000

To solve for H, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11

H = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8000}$"
"To determine the total cost of gift bags for Christina's birthday party, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend. Since 1/4 of the invited guests typically do not show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of guests.

Let's denote the total number of guests as $n$. Then, the number of guests who will attend is given by $n - \frac{1}{4}n = \frac{3}{4}n$.

Given that Christina invited 16 friends, we can substitute $n = 16$ into the equation to find the number of guests who will attend:

$\frac{3}{4} \cdot 16 = 12$

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can find the total number of gift bags needed by multiplying the number of guests who will attend by 0.75:

$12 \cdot 0.75 = 9$

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the gift bags by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag, which is $2:

$9 \cdot 2 = 18$

Therefore, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags for her birthday party.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad required for the dinosaur picnic, we need to calculate the amount consumed by adults and children separately and then sum these values.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad consumed by adults. Given that an adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad, and there are 20 adults attending the picnic, the total amount of potato salad consumed by adults is:

20 \* 10 = 200 pounds

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad consumed by children. Since a child eats half as much as an adult, and there are 5 children attending the picnic, the total amount of potato salad consumed by children is:

5 \* (10 / 2) = 5 \* 5 = 25 pounds

Now, we sum the amounts of potato salad consumed by adults and children to determine the total amount required:

200 + 25 = 225 pounds

Therefore, Ted the T-Rex needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to ensure that everyone has enough to eat.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a linear relationship between the number of pets each individual possesses. Let's denote the number of pets Cindy has as C, Marcia's pets as M, and Jan's pets as J.

We are given that Cindy has 4 pets, so C = 4. We also know that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, which can be expressed as M = C + 2. Substituting the value of C, we get M = 4 + 2 = 6.

Furthermore, Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, which can be represented as J = 3M. Substituting the value of M, we get J = 3(6) = 18.

To find the total number of pets, we sum the number of pets each person has: C + M + J = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28.

Therefore, the total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To determine the age of Jackson, we can establish a series of relationships between the children's ages based on the given information.

Let's denote the age of Corey as C, Amy as A, Jackson as J, and James as M. We are given the following equations:

1. M = 10 (James is 10 years old)
2. C = M + 1 (Corey is 1 year older than James)
3. A = C - 2 (Amy is 2 years younger than Corey)
4. A = J + 5 (Amy is 5 years older than Jackson)

Substituting equation (2) into equation (3), we get:
A = (M + 1) - 2
A = 10 + 1 - 2
A = 9

Now, substituting the value of A into equation (4), we get:
9 = J + 5
J = 9 - 5
J = 4

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by determining Gerald's original time for the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can express Gerald's time as x + 2, where x is Lee's time. Given that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 38

Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation yields:

x = 36

Therefore, Gerald's original time for the 400-meter hurdles is 36 seconds.

Now, we need to find Gerald's new time after his diet improvement. Since his speed increased by 10%, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 10 by 100, which equals 0.1. To find the time saved due to the improvement, we multiply Gerald's original time by 0.1:

0.1 * 36 = 3.6 seconds

Since Gerald's speed improved, his new time will be his original time minus the time saved:

36 - 3.6 = 32.4 seconds

The final answer is: $\boxed{32.4}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a system of equations to represent the relationships between the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits in the neighborhood.

Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of rabbits as R. We are given the following information:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats: R = D + C - 12.
2. There are two cats for every dog: C = 2D.
3. The number of dogs is 60: D = 60.

Substituting the value of D into the second equation, we get C = 2(60) = 120.

Now, we can substitute the values of D and C into the first equation to find R: R = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: Total = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348.

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348.

The final answer is: $\boxed{348}$"
"To determine the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to calculate the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = (2/5) × 200 = 80

Consequently, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys = 200 - 80 = 120

Next, we need to find the number of girls in the girl scout. It is given that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) × Number of girls = (2/3) × 120 = 80

Finally, to determine the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the difference in hours slept between Harry and James, we first need to calculate the number of hours James slept. Since James slept 2/3 of the hours Harry slept, we can express this as a mathematical equation:

Let H represent the number of hours Harry slept, and J represent the number of hours James slept. We are given that H = 9 hours. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

J = (2/3)H

Substituting the value of H, we get:

J = (2/3)(9)
J = 6

Now, we can find the difference in hours slept between Harry and James by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

Difference = H - J
Difference = 9 - 6
Difference = 3

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of tomatoes used by Freda, we can start by analyzing the given information. Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes, and the resulting sauce has a volume of 32 ounces. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume during the cooking process, the initial volume of the tomatoes must be twice the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Given that each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can calculate the number of cans used by dividing the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can find the total number of tomatoes used by multiplying the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

Therefore, the number of tomatoes used by Freda is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. 

Given that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars in the first 15 minutes and the cars in the remaining 15 minutes, which is x + 20.

We are also given that the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

x = 25 - 20
x = 5

Thus, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we need to calculate the total number of plants she initially has and then subtract the number of plants she gives away.

First, we calculate the initial number of plants on the window ledges. Since Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, we can express this as a product of the number of plants per ledge and the total number of ledges: 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants.

Next, we add the 18 new potted plants she received from the nursery to her initial total: 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

Now, we need to determine the number of plants she gives away. Since she gives 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, the number of plants given away is equal to the number of ledges: 40 potted plants.

To find the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants: 98 - 40 = 58.

The final answer is: $\boxed{58}$"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we can start by analyzing the given information. Let's denote the number of times the first friend pressed the doorbell as $x$. The second friend pressed the doorbell $\frac{1}{4}$ times more than the first friend, which can be expressed as $x + \frac{1}{4}x = \frac{5}{4}x$. 

We are given that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the number of times the third friend pressed the doorbell is $60 + 10 = 70$.

Now, we can express the total number of doorbell rings as the sum of the individual counts: $x + \frac{5}{4}x + 70 + 60$. 

Combining like terms, we get $x + \frac{5}{4}x + 70 + 60 = \frac{9}{4}x + 130$. 

We are also given that the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, so we can substitute $x = 20$ into the expression: $\frac{9}{4}(20) + 130 = 45 + 130 = 175$.

Therefore, the total number of doorbell rings is 175.

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day, we must first calculate the total number of pages he has to read. This can be done by summing the pages from each textbook.

Let's denote the total number of pages as $T$. We have:

$T = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8$

Combining like terms, we get:

$T = 39$

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract this from the total to find the remaining pages:

$R = T - 15$
$R = 39 - 15$
$R = 24$

Now, we need to find the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day. He has 4 more days to complete his reading. We can calculate this by dividing the remaining pages by the number of days:

$A = \frac{R}{4}$
$A = \frac{24}{4}$
$A = 6$

Therefore, Solo needs to read 6 pages on average per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he consumes on weekdays and weekends separately and then sum them.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed). Since there are 5 weekdays, the total number of glasses of water consumed on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and one before bed) and 1 glass of soda with dinner. So, he drinks 3 glasses of water on each weekend day. Since there are 2 weekend days, the total number of glasses of water consumed on weekends is 3 * 2 = 6.

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is the sum of the glasses consumed on weekdays and weekends, which is 20 + 6 = 26.

"To determine the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can utilize the concept of rates and proportions. Given that the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes, we can establish a rate of 3 miles/10 minutes.

The city spans a total distance of 42 miles. To find the time it takes to cover the entire city, we can divide the total distance by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city. However, since the rate is given in miles per minute, we can directly use it to calculate the time.

We can set up a proportion to solve for the time:

Time = Total Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / (3 miles / 10 minutes)
Time = 42 * 10 / 3
Time = 140 minutes

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

The final answer is: 140"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. First, we need to determine the number of pieces Poppy placed on the board, which is a quarter of the total 1000 pieces. This can be calculated as:

1000 / 4 = 250 pieces

Now, we need to find the number of pieces remaining after Poppy placed 250 pieces. This can be calculated as:

1000 - 250 = 750 pieces

Next, we need to determine the number of pieces her mom placed, which is a third of the remaining 750 pieces. This can be calculated as:

750 / 3 = 250 pieces

Finally, we need to find the number of pieces left after her mom placed 250 pieces. This can be calculated as:

750 - 250 = 500 pieces

Therefore, there are 500 pieces left to be placed.

"Given that Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir eats, and Amir consumes 5 cookies, we can determine the number of cookies Cody consumes by multiplying the number of cookies Amir eats by 3.

Let's denote the number of cookies Amir eats as A, and the number of cookies Cody eats as C. We are given that C = 3A. Since Amir eats 5 cookies, we can substitute A = 5 into the equation C = 3A.

C = 3(5)
C = 15

Now, to find the total number of cookies they eat together, we need to add the number of cookies Amir eats and the number of cookies Cody eats.

Total cookies = A + C
Total cookies = 5 + 15
Total cookies = 20

Therefore, the total number of cookies they eat together is 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To calculate the total inner volume of the three boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of each box. Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension to account for the thickness on both sides.

The length of the box is 5 inches, so the inner length is $5 - 2 = 3$ inches.

The width of the box is 6 inches, so the inner width is $6 - 2 = 4$ inches.

The height of the box is 4 inches, so the inner height is $4 - 2 = 2$ inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: $3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24$ cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to find the total inner volume: $24 \times 3 = 72$ cubic inches.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can first calculate the total time spent watching 1-hour episodes and then subtract this from the total time spent watching TV to find the time spent watching 30-minute episodes.

Let's denote the number of 1-hour episodes as $n_1$ and the number of 30-minute episodes as $n_2$. We know that on Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of 1-hour shows, so $n_1 = 2$. On Friday, he watched 2 episodes of 1-hour shows, so the total number of 1-hour episodes is $n_1 = 2 + 2 = 4$.

The total time spent watching 1-hour episodes is $4 \cdot 1 = 4$ hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes of TV, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours. Therefore, the total time spent watching 1-hour episodes and 1.5 hours of 30-minute episodes is $4 + 1.5 = 5.5$ hours.

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. Therefore, the time spent watching 30-minute episodes is $7 - 5.5 = 1.5$ hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes is $1.5 / 0.5 = 3$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Given that Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, he initially plans to bake 2x cookies. However, he inadvertently bakes 15 more cookies than intended, resulting in a total of 2x + 15 cookies.

Upon arranging the cookies, Henry drops 5, leaving him with 110 cookies. This situation can be represented by the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides yields:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we can apply a straightforward calculation. The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the cashback reward per gallon is $0.20.

Let's denote the number of gallons as 'n'. In this scenario, n = 10 gallons.

The total cost of gas without rewards is given by the product of the cost per gallon and the number of gallons: $3.00 * n = $3.00 * 10 = $30.00.

The total cashback rewards can be calculated by multiplying the cashback reward per gallon by the number of gallons: $0.20 * n = $0.20 * 10 = $2.00.

To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we subtract the total cashback rewards from the total cost of gas without rewards: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

Therefore, the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00.

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each consumed. This can be achieved by multiplying the width of each roll-up by its length.

Let's denote the width of Beatrice's roll-ups as $w_B = 2$ and the length as $l_B = 24$. Similarly, for Marcell's roll-ups, the width is $w_M = 3$ and the length is $l_M = 14$.

The total number of roll-ups eaten by Beatrice is given by the product of her roll-up's width and length: $T_B = w_B \cdot l_B = 2 \cdot 24 = 48$.

Similarly, the total number of roll-ups eaten by Marcell is given by the product of his roll-up's width and length: $T_M = w_M \cdot l_M = 3 \cdot 14 = 42$.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each and divide by 2: $\frac{T_B + T_M}{2} = \frac{48 + 42}{2} = \frac{90}{2} = 45$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To determine the amount of water the boat took on, we need to calculate the rate at which the boat is taking on water and then multiply it by the total time it takes to reach the shore.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. We know that for every 10 feet rowed, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. Since it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the rate of rowing in feet per second: 

$$\frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}.$$

Now, let's find the total distance rowed in 64 seconds:

$$\text{Distance} = \text{rate} \times \text{time} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet}.$$

Since we are only interested in sets of 10 feet, we can divide the total distance by 10:

$$\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10} = 8 \text{ sets}.$$

Since each set takes on 2 liters of water, we can multiply the number of sets by 2:

$$8 \text{ sets} \times 2 \text{ liters/set} = 16 \text{ liters}.$$

Therefore, the boat took on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to consider the frequency of usage and cleaning. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and the whiteboard is used in each lesson. Since there are 4 teachers, the total number of lessons per day is 4 * 2 = 8.

Given that the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, we can calculate the total number of cleanings by multiplying the total number of lessons by the frequency of cleaning per lesson. Therefore, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted and subtract the ones that did not grow. This is a straightforward application of arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the number of flowers Ryan plants per day as $f$ and the number of days he plants flowers as $d$. In this case, $f = 2$ and $d = 15$. The total number of flowers planted can be calculated as the product of these two values:

$f \cdot d = 2 \cdot 15 = 30$

However, we are given that 5 of these flowers did not grow. To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to subtract the number of non-growing flowers from the total number of flowers planted:

Total flowers = $f \cdot d - 5 = 30 - 5 = 25$

Therefore, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Let's analyze the given information:

Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. This implies that if Jamal's phone can hold $x$ photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold $\frac{x}{6}$ photographs.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold $\frac{1800}{6} = 300$ photographs.

The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is $\frac{300}{50} = 6$.

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the profit made from selling the leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total revenue from selling it.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 each = $100. This can be expressed as 10 \* 10 = $100.
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 each = $80. This can be expressed as 5 \* 16 = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is the sum of the costs of the two types of boards, which is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have increased by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. This can be expressed as 1.5 \* P, where P is the original price.

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 1.5 \* $10 = $15 each.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 1.5 \* $16 = $24 each.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 each = $150. This can be expressed as 10 \* 15 = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 each = $120. This can be expressed as 5 \* 24 = $120.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenues from the two types of boards, which is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"Given the ratio of sugar to water in Katy's coffee mixture is 7:13, we can express this as a fraction, 7/13. To find the total number of parts in the ratio, we add the numerator and the denominator, which yields 20.

Now, we can use the concept of proportions to solve for the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used. Let x be the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar. We can set up the following proportion:

(7/20) = (x/120)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

7 * 120 = 20x

Then, we can divide both sides by 20 to isolate x:

x = (7 * 120) / 20

x = 840 / 20

x = 42

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar.

The final answer is: 42"
"To determine the total amount John paid for the shoes, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. Specifically, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes for all 3 children.

First, we identify the cost of a single pair of shoes, which is $60. Since John buys 2 pairs for each child, the cost for one child is 2 * $60 = $120.

Next, we need to find the total cost for all 3 children. This can be calculated by multiplying the cost for one child by the number of children: $120 * 3 = $360.

Therefore, the total amount John paid for the shoes is $360.

The final answer is: $360"
"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of containers imported on the second day as 'x'. 

We know that the initial number of containers was 2, each containing 5 vehicles, resulting in a total of 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles. On the second day, 'x' containers were added, each containing 5 vehicles, resulting in a total of 5x vehicles. The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30.

We can set up the equation 10 + 5x = 30 to represent this situation. Solving for 'x', we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation, yielding 5x = 20. Dividing both sides by 5, we find that x = 4.

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of percentage increase and the relationship between Adrien's and Lylah's salaries.

Let's denote Adrien's salary four years ago as A = $40000. Since his salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Lylah's salary four years ago as L = 0.7A = 0.7($40000) = $28000.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. This means his new salary is A' = A + 0.4A = 1.4A = 1.4($40000) = $56000.

Similarly, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, so her new salary is L' = L + 0.4L = 1.4L = 1.4($28000) = $39200.

To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries: A' + L' = $56000 + $39200 = $95200.

The final answer is: $95200"
"To determine the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month, we need to calculate his weekly usage and then extrapolate it to a monthly basis.

Given that Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week, and each pad contains 30 sheets, his weekly usage can be calculated as follows:

2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate his monthly usage by multiplying his weekly usage by 4:

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"To determine the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael have, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then sum them together.

Let's denote the number of apples Morisette brought as A and the number of oranges as O. We are given that Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so A = 5 and O = 8.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which can be expressed as 2A. Since A = 5, Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples.

Kael also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which can be expressed as (1/2)O. Since O = 8, Kael brought (1/2) * 8 = 4 oranges.

The total number of fruits Morisette brought is A + O = 5 + 8 = 13.

The total number of fruits Kael brought is 2A + (1/2)O = 10 + 4 = 14.

To find the total number of fruits they have, we add the number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought: 13 + 14 = 27.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we can break down her sleep pattern into distinct periods.

Let's denote the hours she slept on Monday as $M$. Given that she slept 2 hours less on the subsequent two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), we can express the hours she slept during this period as $M - 2$.

For the remaining days of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, which can be represented as $(M - 2) + 1 = M - 1$ hours.

We know that Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday, so $M = 8$. Therefore, the hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday are $8 - 2 = 6$ hours each.

For the rest of the week, she slept $8 - 1 = 7$ hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each day:
- Monday: $M = 8$ hours
- Tuesday: $8 - 2 = 6$ hours
- Wednesday: $8 - 2 = 6$ hours
- Thursday: $7$ hours
- Friday: $7$ hours
- Saturday: $7$ hours
- Sunday: $7$ hours

The total hours she slept throughout the week can be calculated as follows:
$M + (M - 2) + (M - 2) + 4(M - 1) = 8 + 6 + 6 + 4(7)$

Simplifying the expression, we get:
$8 + 6 + 6 + 28 = 48$

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she runs at two different speeds: 10 miles per hour for 3 hours and 5 miles per hour for the remaining time.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. We can use the formula for distance, which is given by:

d = rt

where d is the distance, r is the rate (or speed), and t is the time.

d = rt
d = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
d = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours. The total time is 7 hours, and she has already run for 3 hours, so the remaining time is:

t = 7 hours - 3 hours
t = 4 hours

Next, we need to calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours. Again, we use the formula for distance:

d = rt
d = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
d = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour to find the total distance:

Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's analyze the problem using a logical and mathematical approach.

Given that Jennie stamps one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 60 = 20$. This means that Jennie stamps 20 letters, leaving 40 letters in the pile that still need stamps.

We are also given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Since Jennie added 20 letters to this pile, we can express this as an equation: $x + 20 = 30$, where $x$ represents the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

Solving for $x$, we get:

$x = 30 - 20$
$x = 10$

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

Initially, Julia had 'x' spoons. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so she had a total of x + 5 spoons. After using 3 spoons, she had (x + 5) - 3 spoons left. We are given that this number is equal to 12.

We can set up the equation: (x + 5) - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. Let's denote the number of chicken sausages as C and the number of fish sausages as F. We are given that C = 38 and F = C + 6.

We can express the total number of sausages, T, as the sum of the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: T = C + F.

Substituting the given values, we have T = 38 + (38 + 6).

Using the associative property of addition, we can rewrite this expression as T = 38 + 38 + 6.

Now, we can combine the like terms: T = 76 + 6.

Finally, we can evaluate the expression to find the total number of sausages: T = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. Given that Lily made 50 friends, and Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, we can express Amy's number of friends as 50 + 20 = 70.

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we can simply add the number of friends Lily and Amy have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Dillon will spend at the store, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them together.

First, let's establish the cost of each item. We are given that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, we can express this relationship as:

Watermelon cost = 3 × Pepper cost
Watermelon cost = 3 × $15
Watermelon cost = $45

Next, we are told that an orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon. This can be expressed as:

Orange cost = Watermelon cost - $5
Orange cost = $45 - $5
Orange cost = $40

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- The cost of 4 watermelons is 4 × $45 = $180.
- The cost of 20 peppers is 20 × $15 = $300.
- The cost of 10 oranges is 10 × $40 = $400.

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we sum the costs of the watermelons, peppers, and oranges:

Total cost = Watermelon cost + Pepper cost + Orange cost
Total cost = $180 + $300 + $400
Total cost = $880

The final answer is: $880"
"To determine the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total revenue generated from patient visits.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by doctors. We know that the hospital sees 500 patients a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. 

Total time spent by doctors = Number of patients * Average time per patient
= 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient
= 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total minutes to hours.

Total time spent by doctors (in hours) = 12000 minutes / 60
= 200 hours

The total cost for the doctors is the number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly rate.

Total cost for doctors = 200 hours * $150/hour
= $30000

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from patient visits. The hospital charges $200 per hour to each patient. Since each patient is seen for 24 minutes, we need to convert this to hours.

Time per patient (in hours) = 24 minutes / 60
= 0.4 hours

Total revenue = Number of patients * Time per patient * Hourly rate
= 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient * $200/hour
= 200 hours * $200/hour
= $40000

However, this is the revenue generated from the patients, but the hospital also needs to pay the doctors. To find the profit, we need to subtract the total cost for doctors from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost for doctors
= $40000 - $30000
= $10000

However, this is not the correct answer. The hospital sees 500 patients a day, and each patient is seen for 24 minutes. The doctors charge $150 an hour, and the hospital charges $200 an hour. The correct approach is to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total revenue generated from patient visits.

Total time spent by doctors = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient
= 12000 minutes
= 200 hours

Total cost for doctors = 200 hours * $150/hour
= $30000

Total revenue = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient * ($200/hour) / 60 minutes/hour
= 2000 * $200/hour
= $400000

However, this is the revenue generated from the patients, but the hospital also needs to pay the doctors. To find the profit, we need to subtract the total cost for doctors from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost for doctors
= $400000 - $30000
= $370000

The final answer is: $370000"
"To determine the number of elves left after the incidents, we can apply a step-by-step approach.

Initially, there are 60 elves. A third of them quit after being subjected to unpleasant situations, which can be calculated as follows:

60 / 3 = 20

So, 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Subsequently, 10 more elves quit after being kicked by children. Therefore, the number of remaining elves is:

40 - 10 = 30

Thus, there are 30 elves left.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total expenditure for the two months, we can calculate the individual expenditures and then sum them. 

Let's denote the expenditure in May as M and the expenditure in June as J. We are given that M = $500 and J = M - $60.

We can substitute the value of M into the equation for J to find the expenditure in June:
J = M - $60
J = $500 - $60
J = $440

Now, we can calculate the total expenditure by adding the expenditures in May and June:
Total expenditure = M + J
Total expenditure = $500 + $440
Total expenditure = $940

The final answer is: $940"
"To determine the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred at the carnival, we can break down their activities into two categories: roller coaster rides and luge rides.

Let's denote the number of tickets required for each roller coaster ride as $r$ and the number of tickets required for each luge ride as $l$. We are given that $r = 6$.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so her total number of rides is $2r + 2l$. Similarly, Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so his total number of rides is $4r + 2l$.

We are given that $r = 6$, so we can substitute this value into the expressions for Pam's and Fred's total rides:

Pam's total rides: $2(6) + 2l = 12 + 2l$
Fred's total rides: $4(6) + 2l = 24 + 2l$

The total number of rides is the sum of Pam's and Fred's rides, which is $(12 + 2l) + (24 + 2l) = 36 + 4l$.

We are given that each ride costs 6 tickets, so the total number of tickets used is the total number of rides multiplied by the cost per ride: $(36 + 4l) \cdot 6$.

Since we know that each ride costs 6 tickets, we can substitute $l = 6$ into the expression for the total number of tickets used:

$(36 + 4(6)) \cdot 6 = (36 + 24) \cdot 6 = 60 \cdot 6 = 360$

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider that the luge rides also cost 6 tickets each. Therefore, the total number of tickets used is the sum of the tickets used for roller coaster rides and luge rides.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she used $2r + 2l = 2(6) + 2(6) = 12 + 12 = 24$ tickets. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he used $4r + 2l = 4(6) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36$ tickets.

The total number of tickets used is the sum of the tickets used by Pam and Fred: $24 + 36 = 60$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can utilize a linear equation to model the situation. Let's denote the number of miles walked on Monday as M, the number of miles walked on Tuesday as T, and the number of miles walked on Wednesday as W.

Given that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday, we have M = 4. We are also given that he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, so T = 6M = 6(4) = 24.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles, which can be represented by the equation M + T + W = 41. Substituting the known values for M and T, we get 4 + 24 + W = 41.

Simplifying the equation, we have 28 + W = 41. To isolate W, we subtract 28 from both sides of the equation, yielding W = 41 - 28 = 13.

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the annual expenditure on car washes, we can employ a straightforward calculation based on the given information. Tom receives 4 car washes per month, and each car wash costs $15.

First, we calculate the monthly expenditure by multiplying the number of car washes by the cost per car wash:

4 car washes/month × $15/car wash = $60/month

Next, to find the annual expenditure, we multiply the monthly expenditure by 12, which represents the number of months in a year:

$60/month × 12 months/year = $720/year

Therefore, Tom's annual expenditure on car washes is $720.

The final answer is: $720"
"To determine the number of video games Bobby has, we first need to establish the number of video games Brian has after losing 5. Given that Brian initially has 20 video games, we can express this as:

Brian's remaining video games = Initial video games - Lost video games
= 20 - 5
= 15

Now, we can express the relationship between Brian's and Bobby's video games as an equation. Let's denote the number of Bobby's video games as B. We are given that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. This can be expressed as:

B = 3(15) - 5

To solve for B, we first multiply 3 by 15:

3(15) = 45

Then, we subtract 5 from the result:

B = 45 - 5
= 40

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games."
"To determine the number of female Scottish unicorns, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to calculate the number of unicorns residing in the Scottish Highlands. Given that one-third of the total 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can express this as a fraction:

$$\frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9$$

This indicates that there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we need to find the number of female unicorns within this subset. Since two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this as:

$$\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6$$

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of the items, add the delivery fee, and then add the tip.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items:

- The cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each is 2 × $7.50 = $15.00.
- The cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each is 2 × $1.50 = $3.00.
- The cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each is 2 × $1.00 = $2.00.
- The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

Next, we need to add the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost of the items. To calculate this, we multiply the total cost by 0.20:

$20.00 × 0.20 = $4.00

Now, we add the delivery fee to the total cost of the items:

$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the tip of $5.00 to the total cost with the delivery fee:

$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final numerical answer is: $29.00"
"To determine the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in both tests and subtract that from the total number of questions in both tests.

Let's denote the time taken to complete the first test as $t_1$ and the time taken to complete the second test as $t_2$. We know that Mark completed 75 questions in the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Therefore, we can express the time taken to complete the first test as $t_1 = \frac{75}{5} = 15$ hours. However, since Mark only had 8 hours to complete the test, he actually completed $\frac{8}{t_1} \cdot 5 = 40$ questions in the first test.

Similarly, for the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. The time taken to complete the second test is $t_2 = \frac{100}{5} = 20$ hours. However, since Mark only had 6 hours, he completed $\frac{6}{t_2} \cdot 5 = 30$ questions in the second test.

The total number of questions completed is $40 + 30 = 70$. The total number of questions in both tests is $75 + 100 = 175$. Therefore, the number of questions left incomplete is $175 - 70 = 105$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{105}$"
"Given that there are 12 blue gumballs in the candy machine, we can establish a relationship between the number of blue and pink gumballs. Let's denote the number of pink gumballs as P and the number of blue gumballs as B. We are told that P is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs, which can be expressed as:

P = 4B + 22

Substituting the given value of B = 12 into the equation, we get:

P = 4(12) + 22
P = 48 + 22
P = 70

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs in the candy machine is 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars among the available rentals, we first need to calculate the number of semi-automatic cars. Given that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual, we can find the number of semi-automatic cars as follows:

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiplying by 100:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars among the available rentals is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of worker bees (W), baby bees (B), and queens (Q) in the hive.

Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q. We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write the equation W = 2B. We are also given that there are twice as many babies as queens, so we can write the equation B = 2Q.

We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write the equation W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B into the equation W + B + Q = 700, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q into the equation 3B + Q = 700, we get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q = 100, we can find B by substituting Q into the equation B = 2Q, which gives us B = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find W by substituting B into the equation W = 2B, which gives us W = 2(200) = 400.

Therefore, the number of worker bees in the hive is 400.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Given that Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, if he were to dedicate this time to working, he would effectively add 2 hours to his daily work schedule. 

There are 7 days in a standard week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

His hourly wage is $10, so the total amount of money he would earn in a week is 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To determine the total cost of the items John purchased, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together, taking into account the 10% tax on non-food items.

First, let's calculate the cost of food items:

Food items: 
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total cost of food items = $2 + $3 = $5

Next, we'll calculate the cost of non-food items and the tax on these items:

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total cost of non-food items = $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we can calculate the tax amount as follows:

Tax = 10% of $10 = 0.1 × $10 = $1

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items:

Total cost of non-food items with tax = $10 + $1 = $11

Finally, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax to determine the total cost:

Total cost = $5 + $11 = $16

The final answer is: $16"
"To determine Kim's weekly profit, we need to calculate his total income and total expenses. 

Let's start by calculating the total number of clients, which is the sum of his current clients and potential clients. 

Total clients = 3 (current clients) + 5 (potential clients) = 8 clients

Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week: $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to consider the yield per hectare and the frequency of harvests.

Given that there are 100 pineapples per hectare and John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is calculated as follows:

100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

To find the total number of pineapples harvested in a year, we multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:

1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

Therefore, John can harvest a total of 4000 pineapples within a year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"
"To determine the total number of LEGO pieces Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and sum them together.

Let's denote the number of pieces in the first set as $n_1 = 500$. The second set has three times more pieces than the first set, so the number of pieces in the second set is $n_2 = 3n_1 = 3 \cdot 500 = 1500$. The third set has one-fourth the number of pieces of the first set, so the number of pieces in the third set is $n_3 = \frac{1}{4}n_1 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 500 = 125$.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pieces by summing the number of pieces in each set: $n_{\text{total}} = n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2125}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps.

Let's denote the initial number of bees that leave the hive in the first 6 hours as $B_1 = 30$. In the next 6 hours, half of these bees return, so the number of bees that return in the second 6-hour period is $R_2 = \frac{1}{2}B_1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 30 = 15$.

The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is $B_1 + B_2$, where $B_2$ is the number of bees that leave the hive in the next 6 hours. We are given that $B_2 = 2B_1 = 2 \cdot 30 = 60$.

The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is $B_1 + B_2 = 30 + 60 = 90$. However, we know that 15 bees have already returned, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is $90 - 15 = 75$.

In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees that left the hive fly from the hive and leave, which we already accounted for in $B_2$. However, we are interested in the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours. We are given that every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours. This means that the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is equal to the number of bees that left before that hadn't already returned, which is $75$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of admission is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Since Brittany's mom purchased 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Brittany's mom received $8 in change, which means the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change received. Therefore, we can calculate the amount given as:

Amount given = Total cost + Change
Amount given = $22 + $8
Amount given = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"To solve this problem, we can establish a relationship between the number of friends each person has on Facebook. Let's denote the number of friends Dorothy has as x. According to the problem statement, Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, so the number of friends Charlie has is 3x. We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, which allows us to set up the equation:

3x = 12

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

$$
\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{12}{3}
$$

$$
x = 4
$$

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find the number of friends James has. According to the problem statement, James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, the number of friends James has is 4x, which is equal to 4(4) = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the outcome of the race between Steve and Tim, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to travel from school to their home.

First, let's convert the distances to a common unit. Since both distances are given in miles, we can directly use the conversion factor of 5280 feet per mile. Steve's distance is 3 miles, so his distance in feet is 3 × 5280 = 15840 feet. Tim's distance is 2 miles, so his distance in feet is 2 × 5280 = 10560 feet.

Now, we can calculate the time taken by each of them to travel home. Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute, and Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute.

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 15840 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 36 minutes

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve
Difference in time = 40 - 36
Difference in time = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total revenue generated by Shawnda's bike inflation service, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's consider the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has two tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. Therefore, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * $0.25 = $2.50.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has three tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. Thus, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * $0.25 = $2.25.

Lastly, we'll consider the unicycle tire. A unicycle has one tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. Therefore, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1. The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * $0.25 = $0.25.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"To determine the change Carl receives after purchasing ten packs of cookies, we must first calculate the total cost of the cookies. Given that each pack contains six cookies and each cookie costs $0.10, we can use the following mathematical expression:

Total cost = Number of packs × Number of cookies per pack × Cost per cookie

Substituting the given values, we have:

Total cost = 10 packs × 6 cookies/pack × $0.10/cookie
Total cost = 60 cookies × $0.10/cookie
Total cost = $6

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, the change he receives is the difference between the $10 bill and the total cost of the cookies:

Change = $10 - $6
Change = $4

Therefore, the change Carl receives is $4."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach, utilizing algebraic manipulations to isolate the variable representing the initial number of french fries.

Let's denote the initial number of french fries as $x$. We can then track the number of fries remaining after each event.

Initially, Dave ate 14 french fries, leaving $x - 14$ fries.

The seagull then ate half the amount Dave ate, which is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 14 = 7$ fries. Therefore, the total number of fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is $14 + 7 = 21$. The number of fries remaining is $x - 14 - 21 = x - 35$.

Next, three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they consumed a total of $3 \cdot 3 = 9$ fries. The number of fries remaining after the pigeons ate is $x - 35 - 9 = x - 44$.

A raccoon then stole $\frac{2}{3}$ of the remaining fries, which is $\frac{2}{3}(x - 44)$. The number of fries remaining after the raccoon ate is $x - 44 - \frac{2}{3}(x - 44)$.

We can simplify this expression by first distributing the $\frac{2}{3}$: $x - 44 - \frac{2}{3}x + \frac{88}{3}$. Combining like terms yields $\frac{1}{3}x - \frac{88}{3} + 44$.

Simplifying further, we get $\frac{1}{3}x - \frac{88}{3} + \frac{132}{3} = \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{44}{3}$.

After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. Therefore, we can set up the equation $\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{44}{3} - 1 = 5$.

We can solve for $x$ by first adding 1 to both sides: $\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{44}{3} = 6$.

Next, we multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: $x + 44 = 18$.

Finally, we subtract 44 from both sides to isolate $x$: $x = 18 - 44 = -26$.

However, since the number of french fries cannot be negative, we must re-examine our previous steps. The error lies in the simplification of the expression after the raccoon ate. Let's correct this by re-evaluating the expression $\frac{1}{3}x - \frac{88}{3} + 44$.

We can rewrite 44 as $\frac{132}{3}$ to facilitate the combination of the fractions: $\frac{1}{3}x - \frac{88}{3} + \frac{132}{3} = \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{44}{3}$ is incorrect.

"To determine the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

First, let's calculate the total hours per week. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. This results in a total of 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day for these days. Since there are 3 days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. This results in a total of 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day for these days. Since there are 2 days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is the sum of the hours for both sets of days, which is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. Therefore, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{272}$"
"To determine the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

$$
\begin{aligned}
L_{total} &= L_{rolls} + L_{croissants} + L_{baguettes} \\
&= 1200 + 720 + 1440 \\
&= 3360 \text{ inches}
\end{aligned}
$$

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12:

$$
L_{total} = \frac{3360}{12} = 280 \text{ feet}
$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"
"To determine the total number of bananas required for the apes at the zoo, we need to calculate the monthly consumption of each species and then multiply it by 2 to account for the 2-month period.

The monkeys require 200 bananas per month, while the gorillas need 400 bananas per month. The baboons, being a more frugivorous species, consume 100 bananas per month. 

To find the total monthly consumption, we add the bananas required by each species: 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since we want to determine the total number of bananas needed for a 2-month period, we multiply the monthly consumption by 2: 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine the winner of the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. Therefore, the total distance Blake ran is $2 \times 100 \times 15 = 3000$ yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is $2 \times 100 = 200$ yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is $2 \times 40 = 80$ yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is $34 \times 80 = 2720$ yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is $2720 + 200 = 2920$ yards.

Since $3000 > 2920$, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: $3000 - 2920 = 80$ yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the total amount Raphael spent on school supplies, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the cost of the pens, which is a simple multiplication problem: 4 pens at $1.5 each yields a total of $6. 

Next, we calculate the cost of the notebooks, which is another multiplication problem: 2 notebooks at $4 each yields a total of $8.

Lastly, we have the cost of the bond paper, which is a fixed value of $20.

To find the total amount spent, we add the costs of the pens, notebooks, and bond paper together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $34 on school supplies.

The final answer is: $34"
"To determine the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond, we need to consider the changes in the tadpole population. Initially, Finn observes 11 tadpoles. Subsequently, 6 tadpoles emerge from under a lily pad, increasing the total count to 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. However, 2 of these tadpoles then hide under a rock, rendering them invisible to Finn. To find the updated number of tadpoles Finn can see, we subtract the 2 tadpoles that hid: 17 - 2 = 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the depth of the water on Tuesday. Given that the tank had 7 feet more water on Tuesday than on Monday, we can express this as an increase in the depth.

Let's denote the depth of the water on Monday as $M$ and the depth of the water on Tuesday as $T$. We are given that $M = 17$ feet. The increase in water depth from Monday to Tuesday is 7 feet, so we can express this as $T = M + 7$.

Substituting the value of $M$, we get $T = 17 + 7 = 24$ feet.

Now, we need to find the depth of the water on Wednesday, denoted as $W$. We are given that the depth of the water on Wednesday is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Mathematically, this can be expressed as $W = \frac{2}{3}T$.

Substituting the value of $T$, we get $W = \frac{2}{3} \cdot 24 = \frac{48}{3} = 16$ feet.

Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we can start by calculating the number of fish caught by each individual.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Therefore, the total number of fish caught by Anakin can be calculated as follows:

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish)
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3
Total fish caught by Anakin = 19

Now, let's calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin. We know that Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Similarly, Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which is 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Additionally, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish)
Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5
Total fish caught by Locsin = 13

To find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin, we can add the number of fish caught by each individual:

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we can model the price increase as an exponential function. The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20, and the price increases by 20% every two months.

Let's denote the initial price as P0 = $20 and the number of months as n. The price increase can be modeled as a geometric progression, where the common ratio (r) is 1 + 0.20 = 1.20. Since the price increases every two months, we can calculate the price after 36 months as:

Pn = P0 \* (1.20)^(n/2)

where n is the number of months.

To find the price after 36 months, we can plug in n = 36 into the equation:

P36 = $20 \* (1.20)^(36/2)
= $20 \* (1.20)^18
= $20 \* 1.419067295
≈ $28.38

However, this is the price after 18 months. To find the price after 36 months, we need to multiply this value by 1.20 again, since the price increases by 20% every two months:

P36 = $28.38 \* 1.20
≈ $34.06

However, this is still not the price after 36 months. We need to multiply this value by 1.20 again:

P36 = $34.06 \* 1.20
≈ $40.87

We can continue this process until we reach 36 months. However, a more efficient approach is to use the formula:

P36 = $20 \* (1.20)^18

Using a calculator, we get:

P36 ≈ $40.87

However, this is still not the price after 36 months. We need to multiply this value by 1.20 again:

P36 = $40.87 \* 1.20
≈ $48.84

We can continue this process until we reach 36 months. However, a more efficient approach is to use the formula:

P36 = $20 \* (1.20)^18 \* 1.20

"To determine the total worth of the toys in the room, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then sum them together.

Given that one action figure costs $5, we can establish a baseline for the other toys. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so its cost is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of toy:
- 5 red cars: 5 * $4 = $20
- 3 action figures: 3 * $5 = $15
- 1 doll: $15

The total worth of all the toys is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the financial implications of Jackie's decision, we need to consider the opportunity cost of doing her taxes herself versus hiring an accountant. The opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that is given up as a result of a decision.

In this case, if Jackie decides to do her taxes herself, she will lose the opportunity to earn $35 per hour for 3 hours of freelance work. This represents a loss of income, which can be calculated as follows:

Loss of income = 3 hours × $35/hour = $105

On the other hand, hiring an accountant will cost her $90. To determine the net benefit of hiring the accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the loss of income from doing the taxes herself.

Net benefit = Loss of income - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories and subtract this from her budget.

The total cost of the computer accessories can be calculated as follows:

Computer: €1090
Scanner: €157
CD burner: €74
Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1323

Now, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:

€1500 - €1323 = €177

Therefore, Elvira will have €177 left for her clothing."
"To determine the number of times Sandra must babysit to obtain the required number of eggs, we need to calculate the total number of eggs needed for the Spanish flans and then divide that by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job.

First, we calculate the total number of eggs required: 3 eggs per Spanish flan * 15 Spanish flans = 3 * 15 = 45 eggs.

Next, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job: 45 eggs / 9 eggs per babysitting job = 5.

Therefore, Sandra must babysit 5 times to obtain the required number of eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic equations. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, which can be represented as:

S = 2B

where S is Seth's current age and B is Brooke's current age.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be represented as:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Given that Ethel possesses $8, we can calculate Jimmy's wealth by determining twice the amount Ethel has and then adding $2 to that value. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Jimmy's wealth = (2 × Ethel's wealth) + 2

Substituting the given value of Ethel's wealth, we get:

Jimmy's wealth = (2 × 8) + 2
= 16 + 2
= 18

Therefore, Jimmy has $18."
"To determine the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the average daily miles walked and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is a total of 5 days. On the weekends, he walks 10 miles a day for 2 days. 

The total miles walked from Monday to Friday can be calculated as 20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles. The total miles walked on Saturday and Sunday is 10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles.

To find the average daily miles walked, we add the total miles walked in the week and divide by the number of days: (100 miles + 20 miles) / 7 days = 120 miles / 7 days = 17.14 miles/day (approximately).

However, since we are interested in the total miles walked in a week, we can simply add the miles walked from Monday to Friday and the miles walked on Saturday and Sunday: 100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles.

Therefore, the total miles Pancho walks in a week is 120 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the individual costs of the hat, jacket, and pants, and then sum them.

The cost of the hat is a straightforward $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, which can be expressed as 3 \* $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each uniform by summing the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The final answer is: $150"
"To determine the total number of legs observed by Jake, we can calculate the number of legs for each group of invertebrates and then sum these values.

First, let's consider the spiders. Each spider has 8 legs, and there are 80 spiders. Therefore, the total number of legs for the spiders is given by the product of the number of spiders and the number of legs per spider:

80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs

Next, we consider the insects. Each insect has 6 legs, and there are 90 insects. The total number of legs for the insects is given by the product of the number of insects and the number of legs per insect:

90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs

Lastly, we consider the rare mutant invertebrates. Each mutant invertebrate has 10 legs, and there are 3 of them. The total number of legs for the mutant invertebrates is given by the product of the number of mutant invertebrates and the number of legs per mutant invertebrate:

3 mutant invertebrates * 10 legs/mutant invertebrate = 30 legs

To find the total number of legs observed by Jake, we sum the number of legs for each group:

Total legs = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210

The final answer is: $\boxed{1210}$"
"To determine the total age of the four birds, we can establish a series of relationships between their ages. Let's denote the age of Sally Two as $S_2$, the age of Granny Red as $G$, and the age of Sally Four as $S_4$. We are given that Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. Therefore, $S_4 = S_{32} = 8$.

We are also given that Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so $G = 2S_4 = 2(8) = 16$.

Furthermore, we know that Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so $S_2 = G + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19$.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages together: $S_2 + G + S_4 + S_{32} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{51}$"
"To determine the total annual payment, we need to calculate the increased minimum payment for each debt and then sum these amounts. 

The increased minimum payment for each debt can be calculated by multiplying the minimum payment by 1.5. 

- Student loans: $300 × 1.5 = $450
- Credit card: $200 × 1.5 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 × 1.5 = $750

Now, we add up the increased minimum payments:
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

To find the total annual payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
$1500 × 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To determine the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Let's denote the time it takes to peel one potato as $t_p$ and the time it takes to cut one potato as $t_c$. Given that $t_p = 1.5$ minutes and $t_c = 5/60$ minutes, we can calculate the total time as follows:

Total time to peel all potatoes: $60 \cdot t_p = 60 \cdot 1.5 = 90$ minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: $60 \cdot t_c = 60 \cdot \frac{5}{60} = 5$ minutes

The total time to peel and cut all potatoes is the sum of these two values: $90 + 5 = 95$ minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{95}$"
"To determine the amount spent on lemons, we need to first calculate the total revenue generated from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's denote the number of gallons sold as $g$. The revenue per gallon is $10, so the total revenue is $10g$. The cost of sugar per gallon is $2, and the cost of lemons per gallon is $3. Therefore, the total cost is $5g$.

The profit is given as $25, so we can set up the equation:

$$10g - 5g = 25$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$5g = 25$$

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

$$g = 5$$

Now that we know the number of gallons sold, we can find the cost of lemons:

Cost of lemons = Cost of lemons per gallon * Number of gallons
= $3 * 5
= $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to calculate the total number of Chinese participants. Given that the total number of participants is 240 and the number of Japanese participants is 80, we can find the number of Chinese participants by subtracting the number of Japanese participants from the total.

Let's denote the number of Chinese participants as C. We can express this as:

C = Total participants - Japanese participants
C = 240 - 80
C = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Let's denote the number of girls as G. We can express this as:

G = C - Number of boys
G = 160 - 60
G = 100

Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the amount of money Zaid has left after all expenses and donations, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, let's calculate the amount spent on rent: $\frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 600$. 

Next, we calculate the amount spent on car fuel: $\frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000$.

Now, we can find the remaining amount after rent and car fuel: $6000 - 600 - 2000 = 3400$.

Then, we calculate the amount donated to charity: $\frac{1}{2} \times 3400 = 1700$.

After the donation, the remaining amount is: $3400 - 1700 = 1700$.

Next, we calculate the total amount given to his daughter and wife: $200 + 700 = 900$.

Finally, we can find the final remaining amount: $1700 - 900 = 800$.

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the total number of crabs the three individuals have, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as B, Monic has as M, and Rani has as R.

We are given that Bo has 40 crabs, so B = 40. We also know that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, which can be expressed as M = B - 4. Substituting the value of B, we get M = 40 - 4 = 36.

Furthermore, we are told that Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, which can be written as R = M + 10. Substituting the value of M, we get R = 36 + 10 = 46.

Now, to find the total number of crabs, we can add the number of crabs each person has: B + M + R = 40 + 36 + 46.

The total number of crabs is therefore 40 + 36 + 46 = 122.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"To determine Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks, we can calculate his earnings for each week and then sum them. 

Let's denote Lloyd's hourly wage as $10 and the number of hours tutored in the first week as 5, and the number of hours tutored in the second week as 8. 

For the first week, Lloyd's earnings can be calculated as follows:
Earnings (Week 1) = Hourly Wage * Hours Tutored
Earnings (Week 1) = $10/hour * 5 hours
Earnings (Week 1) = $50

For the second week, Lloyd's earnings can be calculated as follows:
Earnings (Week 2) = Hourly Wage * Hours Tutored
Earnings (Week 2) = $10/hour * 8 hours
Earnings (Week 2) = $80

Now, we can find the total earnings by adding the earnings for the first and second weeks:
Total Earnings = Earnings (Week 1) + Earnings (Week 2)
Total Earnings = $50 + $80
Total Earnings = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we can utilize the concept of proportions. Given that the winner secured 3/4 of the total votes, we can express this as a fraction of the total number of students who voted, which is 80.

Let's denote the number of votes the winner received as W and the number of votes the loser received as L. We know that W + L = 80, as the total number of votes is 80.

We are also given that W = 3/4 * 80. To find the value of W, we can multiply 3/4 by 80:

W = (3/4) * 80
W = 3 * 80 / 4
W = 240 / 4
W = 60

Now that we have the value of W, we can substitute it into the equation W + L = 80 to solve for L:

60 + L = 80

To isolate L, we can subtract 60 from both sides of the equation:

L = 80 - 60
L = 20

Therefore, the number of votes the loser received is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of red roses that Fred must deliver to keep Sandra's business, we need to establish the relationship between the number of white carnations and the number of red roses. We are given that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x, and we know that 5x = 200. To find 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

$$
\frac{5x}{5} = \frac{200}{5}
$$

$$
x = 40
$$

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We are given that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of red roses as 'y'. Then, y = 4x, and we know that x = 40:

$$
y = 4 \cdot 40
$$

$$
y = 160
$$

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"Let's analyze the given information:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 2, we can express the relationship between Mark's age two years ago and Jan's age two years ago as:

M - 2 = (1/2)(J - 2) + 5

where M represents Mark's age and J represents Jan's age.

Given that Jan is 30, we can substitute J = 30 into the equation:

M - 2 = (1/2)(30 - 2) + 5
M - 2 = (1/2)(28) + 5
M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19

Now, we can solve for M by adding 2 to both sides of the equation:

M = 19 + 2
M = 21

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can express Jean's age as:

J = M + 2
J = 21 + 2
J = 23

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

The final answer is: 23"
"To determine the time difference between the two teams, we can calculate the total time for each team by summing the individual times for each runner.

The well-rounded team's total time is the sum of each runner's time, which is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's runners' times can be expressed as an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of -3 seconds. The first term is 60 seconds, and the last term is 51 seconds. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the total time for the less well-rounded team:

S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n)

where S_n is the sum of the first n terms, a_1 is the first term, and a_n is the nth term. In this case, n = 4, a_1 = 60, and a_n = 51.

S_4 = 4/2 * (60 + 51)
S_4 = 2 * 111
S_4 = 222

However, this is the sum of the sequence including the first term, which is 60 seconds. To find the sum of the sequence excluding the first term, we subtract the first term from the sum:

S_4 - a_1 = 222 - 60
S_4 - a_1 = 162

The total time for the less well-rounded team is 162 seconds.

The time difference between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To determine the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, we can calculate the probability of the complementary event (rolling 3 or less) and subtract it from 1. The probability of rolling 3 or less is the sum of the probabilities of rolling 1, 2, and 3, which are 1/6, 1/6, and 1/6, respectively. Therefore, the probability of rolling 3 or less is 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is then 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we can use the formula for the probability of independent events: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B). The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 = 1/2. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

Now, we can find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row: 50% - 25% = 25%.

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Given that Jenna's apple-picking abilities are directly proportional to her mother's, we can establish a ratio of their apple-picking efficiency. If her mother picked 20 apples, we can infer that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother. This can be represented as a ratio of 1:2, where the mother's apple-picking efficiency is twice that of Jenna's.

Mathematically, we can express this as:

Jenna's apples = (1/2) × Mother's apples
Jenna's apples = (1/2) × 20
Jenna's apples = 10

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we can add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mother picked:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mother's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

Therefore, the total number of apples they both picked is 30."
"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we can start by calculating the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits. The hamsters are kept in 10 cages, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw.

The total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 70 pieces are given to the hamsters and the rabbits, the remaining straw pieces are given to the rats. So, the number of straw pieces given to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 6 * 3r = 18r.

We know that the total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 90. Therefore, we can set up the equation 18r = 90. Solving for 'r', we get r = 90 / 18 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where A is the total amount, P is the principal amount ($100), r is the monthly interest rate (2% or 0.02), and n is the number of months (3).

A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3
A = 100(1.02)^3
A = 100(1.061208)
A = 106.1208

Therefore, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we can apply the principles of cost accounting and profit maximization. Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'.

The total cost of purchasing the bags is $20x, as each bag is bought at a rate of $20. The transportation cost for each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is $2x. Therefore, the total cost is $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x, as each bag is sold at a rate of $30.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is given as $400. We can set up the equation:

$$30x - 22x = 400$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$8x = 400$$

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

$$x = \frac{400}{8}$$

$$x = 50$$

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total cost incurred by the three friends, we must first calculate the individual components of their expenses. The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the tickets, which can be expressed as $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75. The cost of the rides is $33 per ride, and since they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by summing the individual components: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

To find the amount each friend paid, we divide the total cost by the number of friends, which is 3. Therefore, each friend paid $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is $34."
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the product of the peaches collected per minute and the total minutes spent collecting.

Given that John collects 2 peaches per minute, we can express this as a rate of 2 peaches/minute. The time spent collecting peaches is 3 hours, which is equivalent to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total number of peaches collected by multiplying the rate by the time:

2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the daily insect consumption of a flock of ten ducks, we must first consider their weekly requirements. Each duck requires 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive. Therefore, a flock of ten ducks would need:

\[ 3.5 \, \text{pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \, \text{ducks} = 35 \, \text{pounds/week} \]

To find the daily insect consumption, we divide the total weekly consumption by 7, the number of days in a week:

\[ 35 \, \text{pounds/week} \div 7 \, \text{days/week} = \frac{35}{7} \, \text{pounds/day} \]

Simplifying the fraction yields:

\[ \frac{35}{7} = 5 \, \text{pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks requires 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to consider the net change in the number of trees over this period. Given that Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, the net change in the number of trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees. Therefore, the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years is 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net change) = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we can calculate 30% of 130 as 0.3 * 130 = 39.

Consequently, the number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final numerical answer is: 91"
"To determine the difference between the number of pink and white plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard at noon on Sunday, we need to break down the events step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is $\frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6$ flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and $18 - 6 = 12$ pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now $12 + 18 = 30$.

The total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: $30 - 6 = 24$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the amount of change Violetta will receive after purchasing the crayons, we need to calculate the total cost of the crayons and subtract it from the amount of money she has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the crayons. Since Violetta needs 5 different colors and each color will have 2 crayons, the total number of crayons she needs is 5 * 2 = 10.

The cost of one crayon is $2. Therefore, the total cost of the crayons is 10 * $2 = $20.

Now, let's calculate the change Violetta will receive. The amount of money she has is $20, and the total cost of the crayons is also $20. 

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

Therefore, Violetta will receive $0 in change.

The final answer is: $0"
"To determine the cost of 8 pens, we first need to establish the cost of a single pen. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, and a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, we can calculate the cost of a pen as follows:

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we can calculate the cost of 8 pens by multiplying the cost of a single pen by 8:

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine the amount of carrots that will not be used, we can apply a simple subtraction operation. Given that each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots and there are 40 restaurants, we can calculate the total pounds of carrots distributed as follows:

Total pounds of carrots distributed = 2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants
= 2 * 40
= 80 pounds

Now, we can subtract the total pounds distributed from the initial amount to find the pounds not used:

Initial amount = 200 pounds
Total pounds distributed = 80 pounds
Pounds not used = Initial amount - Total pounds distributed
= 200 - 80
= 120 pounds

Therefore, the amount of carrots that will not be used is 120 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the number of children in the city of Soda, we can utilize a simple arithmetic operation. Given that the total population of Soda is 23,786, and the population consists of 8,417 men and 9,092 women, we can calculate the number of children by subtracting the sum of the male and female populations from the total population.

Let's denote the number of children as C. We can express this relationship as:

C = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Substituting the given values, we get:

C = 23,786 - (8,417 + 9,092)

First, we calculate the sum of the male and female populations:

8,417 + 9,092 = 17,509

Now, we subtract this sum from the total population:

C = 23,786 - 17,509
C = 6,277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6,277."
"To determine the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

Let's denote the initial number of cards as $n$. Elaine initially had $n = 20$ Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number of cards: $3n = 3 \cdot 20 = 60$ cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month: $60 - 20 = 40$ cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: $2(60 + 40) = 2 \cdot 100 = 200$ cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine has now by adding the cards from each month and the initial number: $n + 3n + (3n - 20) + 2(3n + (3n - 20))$.

Simplifying the expression, we get: $n + 3n + 3n - 20 + 6n + 6n - 40 = 13n - 60$.

Substituting the initial value of $n = 20$, we get: $13 \cdot 20 - 60 = 260 - 60 = 200$.

However, this is the number of cards collected in the third month. To find the total number of cards, we need to add the initial number of cards: $200 + 20 = 220$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{220}$"
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we can break down the problem into manageable components. Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher as x. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we have x = 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Given that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, the total amount he earns from Publisher A is 5x = 5(500) = 2500 cents. 

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so the rate per sentence for Publisher B is 2 * 5 = 10 cents. Therefore, the total amount Mark earns from Publisher B is 10x = 10(500) = 5000 cents.

To find Mark's total weekly earnings, we add the amounts earned from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"
"To determine the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he receives and then multiply it by the volume of water in each pail.

Baldur's daily water intake consists of 5 pails in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon. Therefore, the total number of pails he receives daily is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Given that each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he receives daily can be calculated as follows:

Total water (liters) = Number of pails * Volume of water per pail
Total water (liters) = 11 pails * 5 liters/pail
Total water (liters) = 55 liters

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To determine the total amount John made that year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then multiply it by the number of weeks he worked.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise. The formula for calculating a percentage increase is:

Increase = (Percentage Increase) * (Original Value)
= 0.05 * 2000
= 100

Now, we add the increase to the original salary to find the new salary:

New Salary = Original Salary + Increase
= 2000 + 100
= 2100

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will have the new salary for all 52 weeks of the year. 

To find the total amount made that year, we multiply the new salary by the number of weeks:

Total Amount = New Salary * Number of Weeks
= 2100 * 52
= 109200

The total amount John made that year is $109200."
"To determine the total number of barrels of wine produced per year on Josie's 10-acre farm, we must first calculate the total tons of grapes produced annually. Given that each acre yields 5 tons of grapes per year, we can calculate the total tons of grapes as follows:

Total tons of grapes = Number of acres × Tons of grapes per acre
Total tons of grapes = 10 acres × 5 tons/acre
Total tons of grapes = 50 tons

Next, we need to convert the total tons of grapes into barrels of wine, considering that each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine. This can be calculated as follows:

Total barrels of wine = Total tons of grapes × Barrels of wine per ton
Total barrels of wine = 50 tons × 2 barrels/ton
Total barrels of wine = 100 barrels

Therefore, Josie's 10-acre farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we can break down the problem into three distinct categories: sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish.

First, let's consider the sandwiches. Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week, which consists of 7 days. Each sandwich required 2 slices of cheese. Therefore, the total number of slices used for sandwiches can be calculated as follows:

Total slices for sandwiches = Number of days × Slices per sandwich
= 7 × 2
= 14

Next, we'll examine the omelets. Carl prepared omelets for 3 days, using one more slice of cheese per omelet than per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. The total number of slices used for omelets can be calculated as follows:

Total slices for omelets = Number of days × Slices per omelet
= 3 × 3
= 9

Lastly, we need to consider the macaroni and cheese dish, which required 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add the slices used for each meal together to find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used:

Total slices = Total slices for sandwiches + Total slices for omelets + Total slices for macaroni and cheese
= 14 + 9 + 8
= 31

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To determine the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of blue and red pens she purchased and add them to her initial number of pens.

Let's denote the number of green pens as $G$, the number of yellow pens as $Y$, the number of blue pens as $B$, and the number of red pens as $R$. We are given that $G = 22$ and $Y = 10$. Janet purchased 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so the total number of blue pens she bought is $B = 6 \times 9 = 54$. Similarly, she purchased 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so the total number of red pens she bought is $R = 2 \times 6 = 12$.

The total number of new pens she bought is $B + R = 54 + 12 = 66$.

Janet initially had $G + Y = 22 + 10 = 32$ pens.

Now, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens she bought: $G + Y + B + R = 32 + 66 = 98$ pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we can use the concept of weighted averages. Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we will first find the total score needed for the semester to achieve an average of 93.

Let's denote the score on the sixth test as $x$. The total score needed for the semester is the product of the desired average and the number of tests, which is 6.

Total score needed = Desired average $\times$ Number of tests
= 93 $\times$ 6
= 558

We know the scores of the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. To find the total score of these tests, we sum them up.

Total score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86
= 338

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score from the average, we need to find the total score of the remaining four tests. We subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests.

Total score of remaining four tests = Total score of first five tests - Lowest score
= 338 - 71
= 267

Now, we can set up an equation to find the score needed on the sixth test. The total score of all six tests should be equal to the total score needed for the semester.

Total score of all six tests = Total score of remaining four tests + Score on the sixth test
558 = 267 + x

To find the score needed on the sixth test, we subtract the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score needed.

x = 558 - 267
= 291

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 291 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

The final answer is: $\boxed{291}$"
"To determine the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we can break down the problem into two distinct periods and calculate the total distance for each.

First, let's consider the initial four weeks during which Michael rode his bike 5 times a week, covering a distance of 25 kilometers each time. This can be represented as a simple multiplication problem:

25 km/time × 5 times/week × 4 weeks = 25 × 5 × 4 = 500 km

Next, we'll examine the subsequent three weeks where Michael reduced his frequency to 2 times a week but increased the distance to 60 kilometers each time. This can be calculated as follows:

60 km/time × 2 times/week × 3 weeks = 60 × 2 × 3 = 360 km

To find the total distance covered by Michael, we simply add the distances from both periods:

500 km + 360 km = 860 km

Therefore, the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike is 860 km."
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we must first calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately, then sum them.

The weight of the chocolate bars can be found by multiplying the number of chocolate bars by their individual weight. Given that each chocolate bar weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:

25 \* 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g.

The weight of the candied apples is then calculated by multiplying the number of candied apples by their individual weight:

80 \* 20g = 1600g

To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples:

1000g + 1600g = 2600g

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

Let's break down the problem step by step. On Monday, Rose purchased 4 cakes. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes. This can be expressed as 3(4) or 3 × 4.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes. This can be expressed as 5(12) or 5 × 12.

Now, to find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we can add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60.

Using the commutative and associative properties of addition, we can rearrange the terms to facilitate easier calculation: 4 + (12 + 60). 

First, we calculate the sum within the parentheses: 12 + 60 = 72. Then, we add 4 to this result: 4 + 72 = 76.

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days is 76.

The final answer is: $\boxed{76}$"
"To determine the cost of each cup, we can start by calculating the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups is equivalent to 20 * 12 = 240 cups. To find the cost of each cup, we can divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $\frac{\$34,800}{240} = \$145$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{145}$"
"To determine the number of times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to earn and subtract the amount she already has.

Let's denote the number of times Sara must mow the lawn as $x$. The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 + 2 \times 20 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

The total amount she earns from babysitting is $5 \times 4 = $20. The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is $70 - $10 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can set up the equation $4x = 40 to represent the situation.

To solve for $x$, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: $x = \frac{40}{4} = 10.

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We are given that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the time Gary spends walking around the edge of the local park, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l represents the length and w represents the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(l + w)
P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a constant speed of 3 miles per hour, we can calculate the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the edge of the park.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. According to the problem statement, the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, which can be expressed as x + 50. The total number of customers by the third day is given as 500.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of customers by the third day as the sum of the customers on the first two days and the customers on the third day:

x + (x + 50) + y = 500

However, we are tasked with finding the number of customers on the third day, denoted as y. To isolate y, we can first simplify the equation by combining like terms:

2x + 50 + y = 500

Subtracting 50 from both sides of the equation yields:

2x + y = 450

Since we are interested in finding the value of y, we can isolate y by subtracting 2x from both sides of the equation:

y = 450 - 2x

However, we are not given the value of x. Fortunately, we can use the information provided to find the value of x. We know that the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, and the total number of customers by the third day is 500. We can set up an equation using the information given for the second day:

x + 50 + y = 500

Since we are trying to find the value of y, we can substitute the expression for y from the previous equation (y = 450 - 2x) into this equation:

x + 50 + (450 - 2x) = 500

Simplifying the equation by combining like terms yields:

x + 450 - 2x + 50 = 500

Combine like terms:

- x + 500 = 500

Subtract 500 from both sides of the equation:

- x = -500 + 500

- x = 0

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into the expression for y:

y = 450 - 2x
y = 450 - 2(0)
y = 450

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"Let's analyze the problem using a system of linear equations. We can denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago is 2x gallons.

The rate at which the water is leaking from both pools is 4 gallons/minute. Since 4 minutes have passed, the total amount of water leaked from both pools is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool now as S and the amount of water in the big pool now as B. We can express the amount of water in the small pool now as x - 4 (since 4 gallons leaked out) and the amount of water in the big pool now as 2x - 4 (since 4 gallons leaked out).

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

B = 4S

Substituting the expressions for B and S:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-4 = 2x - 16

Adding 16 to both sides:

12 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

6 = x

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. The amount of water in the small pool now is x - 4 = 6 - 4 = 2 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of hours Lori needs to work to purchase the shoes and the belt, we must first calculate the total cost of the items she wishes to acquire.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the cost of the belt. 

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Next, we need to divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to purchase the shoes and the belt.

The final answer is: 44"
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay in monthly installments and then subtract that from the initial amount borrowed plus the additional 10% interest.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months:

$$\text{Total Amount Paid} = \text{Monthly Payment} \times \text{Number of Months}$$

$$\text{Total Amount Paid} = \$165 \times 12$$

$$\text{Total Amount Paid} = \$1980$$

Next, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay including the additional 10% interest:

$$\text{Total Amount to be Paid} = \text{Initial Amount Borrowed} + (\text{Initial Amount Borrowed} \times 0.10)$$

$$\text{Total Amount to be Paid} = \$2000 + (\$2000 \times 0.10)$$

$$\text{Total Amount to be Paid} = \$2000 + \$200$$

$$\text{Total Amount to be Paid} = \$2200$$

Now, let's calculate the remaining balance:

$$\text{Remaining Balance} = \text{Total Amount to be Paid} - \text{Total Amount Paid}$$

$$\text{Remaining Balance} = \$2200 - \$1980$$

$$\text{Remaining Balance} = \$220$$

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses. 

Given that there are 4 roses in the vase, we can express the number of dahlias as 4 + 7, since there are 7 more dahlias than roses. This can be represented as:

dahlias = roses + 7
dahlias = 4 + 7
dahlias = 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias:

total flowers = roses + dahlias
total flowers = 4 + 11
total flowers = 15

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the average age of the three individuals in three years, we first need to establish their current ages and then calculate their ages three years into the future.

Given that Harriet's current age is 21 years, we can infer the ages of the other two individuals based on the provided relationships. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as 2 * 21 = 42 years. Similarly, Adrian's age is three times that of Harriet, which yields 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, we have the current ages of the three individuals: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). To find their ages in three years, we add 3 to each of their current ages: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To calculate the average age of the three individuals in three years, we sum their ages and divide by 3: 
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

The final numerical answer is: 45"
"To determine the number of points Jojo scored, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the points scored by Jojo as $J$, Naomi as $N$, Yuri as $Y$, and Brianna as $B$. We are given the following information:

1. The total points scored by all four students is 251: $J + N + Y + B = 251$
2. Naomi scored 68 points: $N = 68$
3. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi: $Y = \frac{1}{2}N + 10 = \frac{1}{2}(68) + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44$
4. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi: $B = N + 17 = 68 + 17 = 85$

Substituting the values of $N$, $Y$, and $B$ into the first equation, we get:

$J + 68 + 44 + 85 = 251$

Simplifying the equation, we have:

$J + 197 = 251$

Subtracting 197 from both sides, we get:

$J = 54$

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the total time spent by Carmen on these puzzles, we can calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles separately and then sum them.

The time spent on crossword puzzles can be calculated as the product of the number of puzzles completed and the time taken to complete each puzzle: 3 crossword puzzles * 10 minutes/puzzle = 3 × 10 = 30 minutes.

Similarly, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is given by the product of the number of puzzles completed and the time taken to complete each puzzle: 8 sudoku puzzles * 5 minutes/puzzle = 8 × 5 = 40 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles: 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. Initially, the water tank contains 120 liters of water. After Celine uses 90 liters for her garden, the remaining water in the tank can be calculated as follows:

120 - 90 = 30 liters

This means that there are 30 liters of water left in the tank. Since Celine collects rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, we can calculate the amount of rainwater collected as follows:

2 × 30 = 60 liters

Now, to find the total amount of water in the tank, we add the remaining water and the collected rainwater:

30 + 60 = 90 liters

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the total number of flowers planted by Andy, we need to calculate the number of petunias and add it to the number of geraniums.

Given that Andy plants 90 geraniums, we can express the number of petunias as 90 - 40, since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. This can be represented as:

Number of petunias = 90 - 40
= 50

Now, we can calculate the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
= 90 + 50
= 140

Therefore, the total number of flowers planted by Andy is 140."
"To determine the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we can break down the problem into two parts. 

First, we need to calculate the amount spent on advertising in the second year. Since the company spends a third of the initial $15000 in the second year, we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{1}{3} \times 15000$. 

Using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can rewrite this as $\frac{1}{3} \times 15000 = \frac{1}{3} \times (10000 + 5000)$. 

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses, we get $\frac{1}{3} \times (10000 + 5000) = \frac{1}{3} \times 15000$. 

Now, we can simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. This gives us $\frac{1}{3} \times 15000 = \frac{15000}{3}$. 

To find the value of $\frac{15000}{3}$, we can divide 15000 by 3, which equals 5000.

Now that we have the amount spent in the second year, we can find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years by adding the amounts spent in the first and second years: $15000 + 5000 = 20000$.

The final answer is: $20000"
"To determine the total cost of the rentals, we need to calculate the cost for Carlos and Benji separately and then add them together.

Let's denote the hourly rental cost of the canoe as C = $30 and the hourly rental cost of the banana boat raft as B = $18. The number of hours Carlos uses the canoe is denoted as t_c = 3, and the number of hours Benji uses the raft is denoted as t_b = 5.

The cost for Carlos can be calculated as the product of the hourly rental cost of the canoe and the number of hours he uses it: C * t_c = 30 * 3 = $90.

Similarly, the cost for Benji can be calculated as the product of the hourly rental cost of the banana boat raft and the number of hours he uses it: B * t_b = 18 * 5 = $90.

The total cost of the rentals is the sum of the costs for Carlos and Benji: Total Cost = C * t_c + B * t_b = 90 + 90 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To determine the total duration of Andrew's trip, we need to consider the time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and the time it takes to return by car.

Given that it takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester, we can calculate the time it takes to travel by car as half of this duration. Therefore, the time it takes to travel by car is 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The total duration of the trip is the sum of the time it takes to travel to Rochester by bus and the time it takes to return by car. Therefore, the total duration is 6 + 3 = 9 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the probability of selecting a water-type Pokémon card from James' collection, we need to calculate the proportion of water-type cards to the total number of cards.

Initially, James has 30 fire-type, 20 grass-type, and 40 water-type cards, resulting in a total of 90 cards.

After losing 8 water-type cards, the number of water-type cards decreases to 32, and the total number of cards becomes 82.

Subsequently, James acquires 14 grass-type cards, increasing the total number of cards to 96.

The probability of selecting a water-type card can be calculated as follows:

P(water-type) = (Number of water-type cards) / (Total number of cards)
= 32 / 96

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

P(water-type) = (32 / 96) * 100
= 33.333...%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the probability of selecting a water-type card is 33%.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: $\boxed{33}$"

He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, so 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
The total cost of the extra items is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To determine the time required to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place pieces. 

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute, while her mom's rate is half of that, which is 2 pieces per minute. Their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates, so it is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the time required to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate. 

$$\frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}$$

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

$$\frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 1 \text{ hour}$$

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two months. Given that 30% of the initial 120 watermelons were ready, we can express this as a decimal and multiply it by the total number of watermelons:

$$
\text{Watermelons ready after 2 months} = 0.30 \times 120 = 36
$$

Next, we calculate the number of watermelons remaining after two months by subtracting the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the initial total:

$$
\text{Watermelons remaining after 2 months} = 120 - 36 = 84
$$

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest. To find the number of watermelons ready for harvest at this point, we can multiply the number of remaining watermelons by 3/4:

$$
\text{Watermelons ready after 2 weeks} = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63
$$

Finally, to determine the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the number of watermelons remaining after two months:

$$
\text{Watermelons not ready after 2 weeks} = 84 - 63 = 21
$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the total cost of the fleet of cars, we need to consider the initial purchase price, the tax on the vehicles, and the registration fees.

First, we calculate the total cost of the cars: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000.

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. Assuming a 10% tax rate, we can express this as a decimal by dividing by 100: 10% = 10/100 = 0.1. Then, we multiply the total cost of the cars by the tax rate: $240,000 * 0.1 = $24,000.

The registration fee for each car is $1000, so the total registration fee for 12 cars is 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

To find the total cost, we add the initial purchase price, the tax, and the registration fee: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To determine the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we first need to establish the number of shells she collected on Monday. Given that Robert collects 20 shells on Monday and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, we can express this relationship as:

Kylie's shells on Monday = Robert's shells on Monday + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 20 + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 25

Next, we need to calculate the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, which is 2 times the number of shells she collected on Monday. This can be expressed as:

Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 × Kylie's shells on Monday
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 × 25
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 50

Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday."
"To determine the total number of insects in the garden, we must first establish the ratio of bugs to ants. Given that there are half as many bugs as ants, we can express this relationship as a ratio of 1:2, where the number of bugs is one-half the number of ants.

Let's denote the number of ants as A and the number of bugs as B. We are given that A = 50. Using the ratio, we can express the number of bugs as B = (1/2)A.

Substituting the given value of A, we find B = (1/2)(50) = 25.

To find the total number of insects, we add the number of bugs and ants: Total number of insects = A + B = 50 + 25.

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75.

The final answer is: 75"
"To determine the number of penguins still left sunbathing, we need to calculate the number of penguins that jumped in the ocean and went inside the cave. 

One-third of the total number of penguins, which is 36, can be calculated as follows:

$$\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = \frac{36}{3} = 12$$

So, 12 penguins jumped in the ocean and 12 penguins went inside the cave. In total, 24 penguins left the sunbathing area.

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins:

$$36 - 24 = 12$$

Therefore, there are 12 penguins still left sunbathing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of vines Steve needs to support his cherry tomato consumption, we must first calculate the total number of tomatoes he and his girlfriend consume per week. 

Given that Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, we can calculate his weekly consumption as follows:

$$
\text{Steve's weekly consumption} = 6 \, \text{tomatoes/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 42 \, \text{tomatoes/week}
$$

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can calculate her weekly consumption by dividing Steve's consumption by 2:

$$
\text{Girlfriend's weekly consumption} = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 \, \text{tomatoes/week} = 21 \, \text{tomatoes/week}
$$

The total number of tomatoes they consume per week is the sum of their individual consumptions:

$$
\text{Total weekly consumption} = 42 \, \text{tomatoes/week} + 21 \, \text{tomatoes/week} = 63 \, \text{tomatoes/week}
$$

Given that each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can calculate the number of vines needed to support their consumption as follows:

$$
\text{Number of vines} = \frac{\text{Total weekly consumption}}{\text{Tomatoes per vine}} = \frac{63 \, \text{tomatoes/week}}{3 \, \text{tomatoes/vine}} = 21 \, \text{vines}
$$

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to support his cherry tomato consumption.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we must first calculate the total number of slices required to accommodate all his friends. Given that each friend will receive 4 slices, and there are 20 friends in total, the total number of slices required can be calculated as follows:

Total number of friends: 20
Number of slices per friend: 4
Total number of slices required: 20 × 4 = 80

Since pizzas are sold in slices of 8, we can determine the number of pizzas required by dividing the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:

Number of slices per pizza: 8
Number of pizzas required: 80 ÷ 8 = 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends receives 4 slices.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total number of pens Ram gets, we can approach this problem using a simple iterative process. Initially, Ram buys 25 pens. From these 25 pens, he can create 5 new pens, leaving him with 5 empty pens. These 5 empty pens can then be used to create 1 additional pen. 

Mathematically, this can be represented as follows:

Let's denote the initial number of pens as P. We can create 1 new pen from 5 empty pens, so the number of new pens created from the initial set of pens is P/5. The number of empty pens remaining after this process is P - P/5 = 4P/5.

Now, we can use these remaining empty pens to create more pens. Since we have 4P/5 empty pens, we can create 4P/25 new pens from these. 

The total number of pens Ram gets is the sum of the initial pens, the pens created from the first set, and the pens created from the remaining empty pens. This can be expressed as:

P + P/5 + 4P/25

Simplifying the expression, we get:

P + P/5 + 4P/25 = (25P + 5P + 4P)/25
= 34P/25

Now, we know that Ram initially buys 25 pens, so P = 25. Substituting this value into the expression, we get:

(34 * 25)/25
= 34

Therefore, Ram gets a total of 34 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the amount of money Johnny had after a year, we can follow a straightforward mathematical approach. Initially, Johnny had a sum of $20, to which he added an additional $10, resulting in a total of $30.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Initial amount = $20
Additional amount = $10
Total amount = Initial amount + Additional amount
Total amount = $20 + $10
Total amount = $30

Next, we are told that this sum of $30 tripled in a year. To find the final amount, we can multiply the total amount by 3:

Final amount = Total amount × 3
Final amount = $30 × 3
Final amount = $90

Therefore, after a year, Johnny had $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"Given the problem, we can establish a linear relationship between the ages of the three girls. Let's denote Jessa's age as J, Joan's age as J + 5, and Mary's age as (J + 5) - 2, since Mary is two years younger than Joan.

We are given that Jessa is 20 years old. Therefore, we can substitute J = 20 into the expressions for Joan's and Mary's ages:

Joan's age = J + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
Mary's age = (J + 5) - 2 = (20 + 5) - 2 = 23

Now, we can calculate the sum of their ages by adding their individual ages:

Sum of ages = J + (J + 5) + ((J + 5) - 2) = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To determine the number of students who exited through exit C, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

Initially, there were 1000 students in the hall. We are given that 30% of the students exited through exit A. This can be calculated as follows:

30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students exited through exit A.

The remaining students in the hall are then 1000 - 300 = 700.

Next, we are told that 3/5 of the remaining students exited through exit B. This can be calculated as follows:

3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students exited through exit B.

Now, we need to find the number of students who exited through exit C. Since the remaining students after exit B are the ones who exited through exit C, we can calculate this as follows:

Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280 students exited through exit C.

Therefore, the number of students who exited through exit C is 280.

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a relationship between the number of candies each individual possesses. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as R, James has as J, and John has as H. We are given the following information:

1. H = 54 (John has 54 candies)
2. H = 2R (John has twice as many candies as Robert)
3. J = R + 6 (James has 6 more candies than Robert)

From equation (2), we can express R in terms of H: R = H / 2 = 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we can substitute the value of R into equation (3) to find J: J = 27 + 6 = 33.

To determine the difference in the number of candies between John and James, we subtract J from H: H - J = 54 - 33 = 21.

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"In this scenario, we can model the problem as a simple combinatorial problem. Let's denote the number of books Dolly has as D and the number of books Pandora has as P. We are given that D = 2 and P = 1.

Dolly will read her own books (D) and Pandora's books (P), so the total number of books she reads is D + P = 2 + 1 = 3. Pandora will also read her own books (P) and Dolly's books (D), so the total number of books she reads is also D + P = 2 + 1 = 3.

To find the total number of books read, we simply add the number of books read by Dolly and Pandora: 3 + 3 = 6.

Therefore, the total number of books read by both Dolly and Pandora is 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total time Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Given that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: $\frac{360}{60} = 6$ hours.

Therefore, the total time Mike spends writing a week is 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes used for his daily calls and the extra minutes, then subtract that from his total minutes.

First, let's calculate the total minutes used for his daily calls. Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day and there are 30 days in the month, we can use the formula:

Total daily minutes = 15 minutes/day * 30 days
Total daily minutes = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has 300 extra minutes of calls this month. Therefore, the total minutes used is the sum of the daily minutes and the extra minutes:

Total minutes used = Total daily minutes + Extra minutes
Total minutes used = 450 minutes + 300 minutes
Total minutes used = 750 minutes

Now, we can find the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan by subtracting the total minutes used from the total minutes in the plan:

Remaining minutes = Total minutes in plan - Total minutes used
Remaining minutes = 1000 minutes - 750 minutes
Remaining minutes = 250 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach using algebraic equations.

Let's denote the initial number of fries Griffin had as G, the number of fries Kyle took as K, the number of fries Billy took as B, the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as G', and the number of fries Colby took as C.

We are given the following information:

1. G = 24 (initial number of fries Griffin had)
2. K = 5 (number of fries Kyle took)
3. B = 2K (number of fries Billy took, which is twice the number of fries Kyle took)
4. C = K - 3 (number of fries Colby took, which is 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took)
5. G' = G - K - B + C + G'' (final number of fries Griffin had, where G'' is the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin)

We are also given that the final number of fries Griffin had is 27, so we can set up the equation:

G - K - B + C + G' = 27

Substituting the values of K, B, and C, we get:

24 - 5 - 2(5) + (5 - 3) + G' = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

24 - 5 - 10 + 2 + G' = 27

Combine like terms:

11 + G' = 27

Subtract 11 from both sides:

G' = 16

However, we are asked to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin, which is G'. But we need to consider that G' is the number of fries Griffin had after Ginger gave him some fries. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as x. Then, the equation becomes:

G - K - B + C + x = 27

Substituting the values of K, B, and C, we get:

24 - 5 - 2(5) + (5 - 3) + x = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

24 - 5 - 10 + 2 + x = 27

Combine like terms:

11 + x = 27

Subtract 11 from both sides:

x = 16

However, we need to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin, which is x. But we also need to consider that the problem states that after Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, Griffin had 27 fries. This means that the number of fries Griffin had before Ginger gave him some fries is 27 - x. We can set up the equation:

G - K - B + C = 27 - x

Substituting the values of K, B, and C, we get:

24 - 5 - 2(5) + (5 - 3) = 27 - x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

24 - 5 - 10 + 2 = 27 - x

Combine like terms:

11 = 27 - x

Subtract 27 from both sides:

-16 = -x

Multiply both sides by -1:

16 = x

However, this is not the correct answer. Let's re-examine the problem. We know that Griffin had 27 fries after Ginger gave him some fries. We also know that Colby took 2 fries from Griffin. So, the number of fries Griffin had before Colby took 2 fries is 27 + 2 = 29. We can set up the equation:

However, we are asked to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin, which is G'. But we need to consider that G' is the number of fries Griffin had after Ginger gave him some fries. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as x. Then, the equation becomes:

G - K - B + C + x = 29

Substituting the values of K, B, and C, we get:

24 - 5 - 2(5) + (5 - 3) + x = 29

Simplifying the equation, we get:

24 - 5 - 10 + 2 + x = 29

Combine like terms:

11 + x = 29

Subtract 11 from both sides:

x = 18

However, this is not the correct answer. Let's re-examine the problem again. We know that Griffin had 27 fries after Ginger gave him some fries. We also know that Colby took 2 fries from Griffin. So, the number of fries Griffin had before Colby took 2 fries is 27 + 2 = 29. We can set up the equation:

G - K - B + C + G' = 29

Substituting the values of K, B, and C, we get:

24 - 5 - 2(5) + (5 - 3) + G' = 29

Simplifying the equation, we get:

24 - 5 - 10 + 2 + G' = 29

Combine like terms:

11 + G' = 29

Subtract 11 from both sides:

G' = 18

"Let's analyze the given problem. We have two aquariums, one containing 4 snails and the other containing 32 snails. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 28, which is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Therefore, the total number of fish is 2x.

We can set up the equation based on the given information:

28 = 2(2x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

28 = 4x

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 4:

x = 28/4

x = 7

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total cost of the makeup services for the movie, we need to calculate the cost per day, then multiply it by the number of days worked per week, and finally multiply it by the number of weeks.

Given that the makeup artist charges $250 per hour and requires 6 hours per day, the cost per day can be calculated as follows:

Cost per day = $250/hour * 6 hours/day = $1500/day

Since the makeup artist works 4 days a week, the weekly cost is:

Cost per week = $1500/day * 4 days/week = $6000/week

The movie production takes 5 weeks to complete, so the total cost for the makeup services is:

Total cost = $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30,000

After the completion of the movie, the makeup artist offers a 10% discount on the total cost. To calculate the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.10:

Discount = $30,000 * 0.10 = $3000

The final amount Jean paid is the total cost minus the discount:

Amount paid = $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To determine the amount each person paid for the party supplies, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party. This can be achieved by summing the individual costs of the cake, presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags.

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle and her two parents split the cost evenly, there are 3 people in total. To find the amount each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$\frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of people}} = \frac{\$96}{3}$
$\frac{\$96}{3} = \$32$

Therefore, each person paid $32."
"To determine the total cost of the onions, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

Given that the chef purchased 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds, we can calculate the total weight as follows:

Total weight = Number of bags × Weight per bag
Total weight = 4 bags × 50 pounds/bag
Total weight = 200 pounds

The cost per pound of onions is $1.50. Therefore, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Total cost = Total weight × Cost per pound
Total cost = 200 pounds × $1.50/pound
Total cost = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister, we need to calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate and then multiply it by the calories per cookie.

Let's denote the number of cookies eaten by Sue's sister on Monday as $x$. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, the number of cookies she ate on Monday is $4x$. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate $2(13) = 26$ cookies. Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday.

The total number of cookies eaten by Sue is $4x + 26$, and the total number of cookies eaten by her sister is $x + 13$. Since each cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by Sue is $(4x + 26) \cdot 200$ and the total calories consumed by her sister is $(x + 13) \cdot 200$.

We are given that her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, so we can set up the equation $x = 5$. Substituting this into the expressions for the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister, we get:

Total calories consumed by Sue: $(4 \cdot 5 + 26) \cdot 200 = (20 + 26) \cdot 200 = 46 \cdot 200 = 9200$
Total calories consumed by her sister: $(5 + 13) \cdot 200 = 18 \cdot 200 = 3600$

The difference in calories consumed is $9200 - 3600 = 5600$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5600}$"
"Given that each class in the school has 20 students and there are 3 classes, we can calculate the total number of students in the school as 20 * 3 = 60.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We are given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. Therefore, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33.

However, this implies that the number of boys in the third class is 30 - 33 = -3, which is not possible. This inconsistency suggests that the given information is incorrect or incomplete.

However, if we assume that the given information is correct, we can proceed with the calculation. In this case, the number of boys in the third class is -3, but this is not a feasible solution.

To resolve this inconsistency, let's re-examine the given information. We know that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and each class has 20 students. We can use this information to find the number of boys in the third class.

Let's denote the number of boys in the third class as x. Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the third class is 0.5 * 20 = 10.

We are given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. Therefore, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

The total number of girls in the school is 30, and the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the number of boys in the third class is x, the total number of students in the third class is x + 3.

We know that each class has 20 students, so we can set up the equation: x + 3 = 20.

Solving for x, we get x = 17.

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 17.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the current number of apps on Travis's tablet, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. Initially, Travis had 61 apps. He then deleted 9 apps, which can be represented as a subtraction operation: 61 - 9. This yields a result of 52 apps.

Next, Travis downloaded 18 new apps. To find the total number of apps on his tablet, we can add the number of apps he downloaded to the result from the previous operation: 52 + 18.

Performing the addition, we get 52 + 18 = 70.

Therefore, the current number of apps on Travis's tablet is 70."
"To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we can break down the information provided into two separate events: the first night and the second day.

Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed on the second day as x. According to the problem, he killed three fewer cougars on the second day than on the first night, which means he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars on the second day.

Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars on the second day, the number of wolves he killed on the second day is 3x = 3(12) = 36.

On the first night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. On the second day, he killed 36 wolves and 12 cougars.

The total number of wolves killed is 10 (first night) + 36 (second day) = 46.
The total number of cougars killed is 15 (first night) + 12 (second day) = 27.

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is 46 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 73.

The final answer is: $\boxed{73}$"
"To determine the floor Bill is on, we can use a simple algebraic expression. Let's denote the starting floor as 's' and the target floor as 't'. We are given that the target floor is equal to 4 times the starting floor plus 6. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

t = 4s + 6

Given that Bill starts on the 3rd floor, we can substitute s = 3 into the equation:

t = 4(3) + 6
t = 12 + 6
t = 18

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To determine the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to calculate the number of times Anne went down the slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can express this as a mathematical equation:

Let x be the number of times Mitchel went down the slide. Then, the number of times Anne went down the slide is x - 0.3x = 0.7x.

Given that Mitchel went down the slide 30 times, we can substitute x = 30 into the equation:

0.7x = 0.7(30) = 21

So, Anne went down the slide 21 times.

Now, we need to find the number of times Robert went down the slide, which is 4 times as much as Anne. We can express this as:

Number of times Robert went down the slide = 4 × Number of times Anne went down the slide
= 4 × 21
= 84

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to calculate the total number of cows added to each stall. Since Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls, we can calculate the number of cows added to each stall as follows:

Let's denote the number of cows added to each stall as x. Then, the total number of cows added is 10x. Since Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows, we can set up the equation:

10x = 40

Solving for x, we get:

x = 40 / 10
x = 4

Now that we know each stall has 4 additional cows, we can calculate the total number of cows in each stall by adding the initial 20 cows to the 4 new cows:

Number of cows in each stall = 20 + 4
= 24

To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:

Number of cows in 8 stalls = 24 * 8
= 192

The final answer is: $\boxed{192}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then sum them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the coins. We have 100 pennies, 40 nickels, and 20 dimes. The value of each type of coin can be calculated as follows:

- 100 pennies = 100 \* $0.01 = $1.00
- 40 nickels = 40 \* $0.05 = $2.00
- 20 dimes = 20 \* $0.10 = $2.00

Next, we need to calculate the value of the dollar bills. We have 40 dollar bills, each with a value of $1.00.

- 40 dollar bills = 40 \* $1.00 = $40.00

Now, let's add the values together to find the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank:

$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Brady has a total of $45.00 in his piggy bank.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To determine the total weight of the redwood, we must first calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. Given that the redwood is 200 feet tall, we can divide the total height by the length of each section to obtain the number of sections: 

$$\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}.$$

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we can calculate the total weight of the redwood by multiplying the number of sections by the weight of each section:

$$20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}.$$

However, termites have consumed 30% of the wood, so we must subtract 30% of the total weight from the total weight to find the final weight. To calculate 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3:

$$0.3 \times 8000 = 2400.$$

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000 to find the final weight:

$$8000 - 2400 = 5600.$$

The final weight of the redwood is 5600 pounds."
"To determine the total amount Nancy has to pay for returning her overdue books, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue.

The cost of the overdue books can be calculated by multiplying the number of books by the cost per book: 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

In addition to the cost of the overdue books, there is a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is the sum of the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

The total amount Nancy has to pay for returning her overdue books is $6.00."
"Let's analyze the given information to determine the total number of fruits.

Given that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can express this relationship as A = J + 8, where A represents the number of apples Andrea has and J represents the number of apples Jamal has. We are also given that Andrea has 52 apples, so we can substitute this value into the equation to find Jamal's number of apples: 52 = J + 8.

Solving for J, we get J = 52 - 8 = 44. This means Jamal has 44 apples.

We are also given that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so the number of bananas Jamal has is J + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48.

Furthermore, we know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which can be expressed as A/2 = J. Since we know Andrea has 52 apples, we can substitute this value into the equation to find the number of bananas Andrea has: 52/2 = 26.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have: 52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 26 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) = 170.

However, we can also express the total number of fruits as the sum of the number of apples and bananas that both individuals have: (A + J) + (A/2 + J). Substituting the known values, we get (52 + 44) + (52/2 + 44) = 96 + 48 = 144.

However, this is not the correct answer. The correct total number of fruits is actually 170.

The final answer is: $\boxed{170}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she is making. Given that she is baking 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since two cups of flour are required to make a dozen (12) cookies, we can express this as a ratio: 12 cookies : 2 cups of flour. To find the amount of flour needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion:

(12 cookies / 2 cups) = (66 cookies / x cups)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

12x = 66 * 2

12x = 132

Now, we can divide both sides by 12 to find x:

x = 132 / 12

x = 11

Therefore, Carla needs 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

The final answer is: 11"
"To determine the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to calculate two thirds of 9,300. This can be expressed as:

(2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200

Since each penny is valued at $0.01, we can multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount:

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

Therefore, the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62.

The final answer is: $62"
"To determine the total number of marbles Maddison possesses, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic operation. Initially, she has 5 boxes, each containing 50 marbles. This can be represented as a product of the number of boxes and the number of marbles per box: 5 * 50 = 250 marbles.

Subsequently, she receives 20 marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles she now has, we add the initial number of marbles to the number of marbles received: 250 + 20 = 270.

Therefore, Maddison now has a total of 270 marbles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To determine the difference in the number of trees between Harry's and Ferdinand's yards, we can establish a sequence of relationships between the number of trees each individual possesses.

Let's denote the number of trees in Chris's yard as $C$, the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard as $F$, and the number of trees in Harry's yard as $H$. We are given that $C = 6$.

Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so we can express this relationship as $F = \frac{1}{2}C$. Substituting the value of $C$, we get $F = \frac{1}{2}(6) = 3$.

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. This relationship can be expressed as $H = 2F + 5$. Substituting the value of $F$, we get $H = 2(3) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11$.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we can calculate $H - F = 11 - 3 = 8$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the combined amount of money the three girls have, we can calculate their individual amounts and then sum them up.

Let's denote Carmen's amount as C, Samantha's amount as S, and Daisy's amount as D. We are given that C = $100, S = C + $25, and D = S + $50.

Substituting the value of S in terms of C, we get S = $100 + $25 = $125. Then, substituting the value of D in terms of S, we get D = $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, we can calculate the total amount by adding the individual amounts: C + S + D = $100 + $125 + $175.

Using the associative property of addition, we can rearrange the terms to get: (C + S) + D = $100 + $125 + $175.

Combining like terms, we get: C + S + D = $300 + $175 = $475.

The final answer is: $475"
"To determine the total cost of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee as a percentage of the selling price. The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which can be calculated as:

Brokerage Fee = 0.05 × $350,000 = $17,500

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which can be calculated as:

Transfer Fee = 0.12 × $350,000 = $42,000

The total cost of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee:

Total Cost = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

To find the difference between the total cost and Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total cost:

Difference = Total Cost - Budget
= $409,500 - $400,000
= $4,500

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees, which amount to 3% of the selling price. This can be expressed as:

Transfer fees = 0.03 \* Selling price
= 0.03 \* $400,000
= $12,000

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price:

Brokerage fee = 0.05 \* Selling price
= 0.05 \* $400,000
= $20,000

The total fees paid by Mr. Tan are the sum of the transfer fees and the brokerage fee:

Total fees = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee
= $12,000 + $20,000
= $32,000

Now, we subtract the total fees from the selling price to obtain the net selling price:

Net selling price = Selling price - Total fees
= $400,000 - $32,000
= $368,000

Finally, we subtract the remaining loan amount from the net selling price to determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds:

Net proceeds = Net selling price - Remaining loan amount
= $368,000 - $250,000
= $118,000

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To determine the total time required to cook the chicken, we need to consider the time it takes to heat the oil to the desired temperature and the time it takes to cook the chicken.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Given that it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, we can find the additional time required to reach 400 degrees by calculating 40% of 20 minutes.

40% of 20 minutes is equivalent to 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. Therefore, it takes an additional 8 minutes to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees. The total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Next, we need to determine the time it takes to cook the chicken. It is given that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Therefore, the cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time it takes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees, and the time it takes to cook the chicken. This is given by 20 + 28 + 23 = 71 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{71}$"
"To determine the total expenditure on advertising, we need to calculate the cost of newspaper ads and television ads separately and then sum them up.

The cost of newspaper ads can be calculated by multiplying the cost per ad ($5) by the number of ads purchased (50). This can be expressed as:

Cost of newspaper ads = $5 * 50
= $250

The cost of television ads can be calculated by multiplying the cost per ad ($75) by the number of ads purchased (15). This can be expressed as:

Cost of television ads = $75 * 15
= $1125

To find the total expenditure on all ads, we add the cost of newspaper ads and television ads:

Total expenditure = Cost of newspaper ads + Cost of television ads
= $250 + $1125
= $1375

Therefore, the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads is $1375."
"To determine the number of blue golf balls, we can break down the problem into manageable steps. 

First, we know that the juggler can juggle a total of 16 balls. Given that half of these balls are golf balls, we can calculate the number of golf balls as follows:

Total balls = 16
Golf balls = Total balls / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8

Now, we are told that half of the golf balls are blue. To find the number of blue golf balls, we can divide the number of golf balls by 2:

Blue golf balls = Golf balls / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4

Therefore, the number of blue golf balls is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total number of M&Ms Mary obtained, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them together.

Let's denote the number of M&Ms in the first bag as $x$. We are given that the first bag contains 300 M&Ms, so $x = 300$.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, which can be expressed as $x + 12$. Substituting the value of $x$, we get $300 + 12 = 312$ M&Ms in the second bag.

The third bag has a hole in it, so it only contains half the number of M&Ms as the first bag. This can be represented as $\frac{x}{2}$. Substituting the value of $x$, we get $\frac{300}{2} = 150$ M&Ms in the third bag.

Now, let's calculate the total number of M&Ms Mary obtained by summing the number of M&Ms in each bag:

$$\text{Total M&Ms} = x + (x + 12) + \frac{x}{2}$$

Substituting the value of $x$, we get:

$$\text{Total M&Ms} = 300 + 312 + 150$$

Evaluating the expression, we get:

$$\text{Total M&Ms} = 762$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{762}$"
"To determine the total number of windows in the houses, we can break down the problem into manageable components. 

First, we calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms. Since each house has 3 bedrooms and each bedroom has 2 windows, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is given by the product of the number of bedrooms per house and the number of windows per bedroom, multiplied by the total number of houses. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

Total windows in bedrooms = (3 bedrooms/house) * (2 windows/bedroom) * (2 houses) = 12 windows

Next, we consider the additional windows in each house that are not connected to bedrooms. There are 4 such windows in each house, and since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:

Total additional windows = (4 windows/house) * (2 houses) = 8 windows

To find the total number of windows in the houses, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the total number of additional windows:

Total windows = Total windows in bedrooms + Total additional windows
= 12 windows + 8 windows
= 20 windows

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the change the cashier should give back to the mother, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased and then subtract that amount from the $20 she paid.

The items purchased include cocoa at $4.20, laundry at $9.45, and a package of pasta at $1.35. To find the total cost, we add these amounts together.

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35
Total cost = $14.00

Now, we subtract the total cost from the $20 the mother paid to find the change.

Change = $20 - $14.00
Change = $6.00

Therefore, the change the cashier should give back to the mother is $6.00."
"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, we can start by calculating the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is $\frac{1}{10} \times 900 = 90$ stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is $2 \times 90 = 180$ stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is $90 + 180 = 270$ stitches.

Since the whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project, and the body takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is $1800 - 900 - 270 = 630$ stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes $\frac{630}{2} = 315$ stitches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{315}$"
"To determine the total expenditure on seeds, we can calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then sum them.

The cost of the tomato seeds can be calculated as follows:

20 packets of tomato seeds * $40 per packet = 20 × 40 = $800

The cost of the celery seeds can be calculated as follows:

80 packets of celery seeds * $30 per packet = 80 × 30 = $2400

The total cost of the seeds is the sum of the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds:

Total cost = $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds is $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

Let's start with the solo song, which has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 × 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of these lines are Sean's, we can calculate his lines from the first scene as (1/3) × 108 = 36.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so we can calculate his lines from the second scene as (4/5) × 60 = 48.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To determine the number of cards with the letter D, we can apply a step-by-step approach to calculate the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C, and then subtract this total from the overall number of cards.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: $\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32$ cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are $80 - 32 = 48$. Then, $\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24$ cards have the letter B.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are $48 - 24 = 24$. Then, $\frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15$ cards have the letter C.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: $80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we can calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes. This can be expressed as 3 \* 30 = 90.

Next, we calculate the time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes. This can be expressed as 10 \* 15 = 150.

Now, we add the time for small holes and large holes to find the total time: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

Therefore, the total time it takes Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is 4 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Given that the sum of Mico and Marco's ages is 20, we can express this as an equation: M + m = 20, where M represents Mico's current age and m represents Marco's current age.

To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to consider the future ages of both individuals. In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be m + 10. Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (m + 10).

Substituting M + m = 20 into the equation, we get (M + 10) + (m + 10) = 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider that the sum of their ages in 10 years is the sum of their current ages plus 20 (10 years for each person). Therefore, the correct calculation is 20 + 20 = 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. We can express the given information as a system of linear equations:

R = 6S  ... (Equation 1)
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)  ... (Equation 2)

We can simplify Equation 2 by expanding and rearranging the terms:

R + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides yields:

R = 3S + 18

Now, we can substitute the expression for R from Equation 1 into the above equation:

6S = 3S + 18

Subtracting 3S from both sides gives us:

3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3 yields:

S = 6

Therefore, Sam's current age is 6 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total amount Peter paid, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. Specifically, we will utilize the distributive property of multiplication over addition to calculate the total cost.

First, we calculate the cost of the popsicles: 20 popsicles at $0.25 each can be expressed as 20 × 0.25. This can be computed as follows:

20 × 0.25 = 20 × (250/1000) = (20 × 250) / 1000 = 5000 / 1000 = 5

Next, we calculate the cost of the ice cream bars: 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each can be expressed as 4 × 0.50. This can be computed as follows:

4 × 0.50 = 4 × (500/1000) = (4 × 500) / 1000 = 2000 / 1000 = 2

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars:

Total cost = cost of popsicles + cost of ice cream bars = 5 + 2 = 7

Therefore, Peter paid a total of $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the total number of spots on the cobras. Since there are 40 cobras and each cobra has 70 spots, we can calculate the total number of spots on the cobras as follows:

Total spots on cobras = Number of cobras × Number of spots per cobra
= 40 × 70
= 2800

Next, we need to find the total number of spots on the mambas. We are given that the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras. Therefore, the number of spots per mamba is:

Number of spots per mamba = Number of spots per cobra / 2
= 70 / 2
= 35

Now, we can calculate the total number of spots on the mambas:

Total spots on mambas = Number of mambas × Number of spots per mamba
= 60 × 35
= 2100

To find the total number of spots on both the cobras and mambas, we add the total number of spots on each group:

Total spots = Total spots on cobras + Total spots on mambas
= 2800 + 2100
= 4900

Finally, we need to find half the total number of spots:

Half the total spots = Total spots / 2
= 4900 / 2
= 2450

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the total amount Maddy will spend on pizzas, we need to calculate the total number of people she needs to accommodate and then divide that by the number of people each pizza serves.

First, let's calculate the total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. Therefore, the total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Now, we can calculate the total amount Maddy will spend by multiplying the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza: 13 * $15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we must first calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the spaces between the gemstones.

Given that each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and there are 8 of them, the total length occupied by the gemstones is $8 \cdot 1 = 8$ inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. 

The space between the gemstones is filled with sterling silver beads, and each bead is $\frac{1}{4}$ inch long. To find the number of beads, we need to find the total length of the spaces between the gemstones. Since there are 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them. The total length of these spaces is $7 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{7}{4} = 1.75$ inches.

Now, we subtract the length occupied by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the spaces: $25 - 8 = 17$ inches.

However, we already know that the length of the spaces is 1.75 inches. To find the number of beads, we need to divide the length of the spaces by the length of each bead: $\frac{1.75}{\frac{1}{4}} = 1.75 \div \frac{1}{4} = 1.75 \cdot \frac{4}{1} = 7$.

Therefore, Katerina uses 7 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To calculate the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, let's determine the number of stories written in the first week. We have three individuals contributing to the total count: Alani, Braylen, and Margot. Their respective contributions are as follows:

- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.

The total number of stories written in the first week is the sum of their individual contributions:

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. This can be represented as a multiplication of their first-week contributions by 2.

- Alani's second-week contribution = 20 × 2 = 40 stories
- Braylen's second-week contribution = 40 × 2 = 80 stories
- Margot's second-week contribution = 60 × 2 = 120 stories

The total number of stories written in the second week is the sum of their second-week contributions:

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week:

Total stories = 120 + 240 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To determine the brother's age in 3 years, we first need to establish his current age. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can express this relationship as an equation: 

Let B represent the brother's age. Then, B = 2 * 9, which simplifies to B = 18.

Now, to find the brother's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: B + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21.

Therefore, the brother will be 21 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left after purchasing a can of pop, we need to calculate the total value of her initial funds and then subtract the cost of the pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. The value of a quarter is $0.25, and the value of a dime is $0.10. Therefore, the total value of her quarters is 5 × $0.25 = $1.25, and the total value of her dimes is 2 × $0.10 = $0.20.

The total amount Kelly has is the sum of the value of her quarters and dimes, which is $1.25 + $0.20 = $1.45.

Now, if she buys a can of pop for $0.55, we can calculate the amount of money she has left by subtracting the cost of the pop from her initial amount:

$1.45 - $0.55 = $0.90

Therefore, Kelly will have $0.90 left after purchasing the can of pop.

The final answer is: $0.90"
"To determine the number of rows of 5-star rows on the flag, we can start by calculating the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is $3 \times 8 = 24$. Similarly, there are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is $2 \times 6 = 12$.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is $24 + 12 = 36$. Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is $76 - 36 = 40$.

Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is $\frac{40}{5} = 8$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of trucks required to transport 80 flagstones, we need to consider the weight capacity of each truck and the total weight of the flagstones. Given that each flagstone weighs 75 pounds and the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, we can calculate the total weight of the flagstones as follows:

Total weight of flagstones = Number of flagstones × Weight of each flagstone
= 80 flagstones × 75 pounds/flagstone
= 6000 pounds

Now, we can divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks to find the number of trucks needed:

Number of trucks = Total weight of flagstones ÷ Weight capacity of each truck
= 6000 pounds ÷ 2000 pounds/truck
= 3 trucks

Therefore, 3 trucks will be required to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Given that the car in the fast lane is traveling at a constant velocity of 60 miles per hour, and it covers a total distance of 480 miles, we can calculate the time taken using the fundamental kinematic equation:

time = distance / speed

Substituting the given values, we get:

time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 30 miles per hour. To find the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance, we can use the same kinematic equation:

time = distance / speed

Substituting the given values, we get:

time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Given that Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, we can express Izzy's number of medals as 22 - 5 = 17. The total number of medals they have together is the sum of their individual medals, which is 22 + 17 = 39.

Now, we are told that together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This can be expressed as an equation:

39 = (1/10) \* x

where x is the total number of medals given out for counting. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 \* 10
x = 390

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Given that each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, we can calculate the total number of chocolate bars as follows:

Total chocolate bars = Number of packets × Number of chocolate bars per packet
= 8 packets × 5 chocolate bars/packet
= 40 chocolate bars

Next, we need to find out how many chocolate bars will be allocated to the adults. Since each adult receives 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars allocated to adults is:

Total chocolate bars allocated to adults = Number of adults × Number of chocolate bars per adult
= 4 adults × 6 chocolate bars/adult
= 24 chocolate bars

Now, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars remaining for the children. This can be calculated as follows:

Remaining chocolate bars for children = Total chocolate bars - Total chocolate bars allocated to adults
= 40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars
= 16 chocolate bars

Since there are 8 children, we can find out how many chocolate bars each child will receive by dividing the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children:

Chocolate bars per child = Remaining chocolate bars for children ÷ Number of children
= 16 chocolate bars ÷ 8 children
= 2 chocolate bars/child

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine Susan's earnings for the online task, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's calculate the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a 3-hour period. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

The time she works is given by the difference between the end and start times, which is 11 a.m. - 8 a.m. = 3 hours. Since she pauses for 0.5 hours, we subtract this from the total time:

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes first. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Let's denote the initial points of Mike, Jim, and Tony as M, J, and T, respectively. We are given that M = 21, J = M - 3, and T = 2M.

Substituting the value of M into the equations for J and T, we get J = 21 - 3 = 18 and T = 2(21) = 42.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. This means that Mike and Tony will receive an extra point, while Jim will not.

The updated points for each player are M' = M + 1 = 21 + 1 = 22, J' = J = 18, and T' = T + 1 = 42 + 1 = 43.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: M' + J' + T' = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

The total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed is 83.

The final answer is: $\boxed{83}$"
"To solve this problem, we can apply basic arithmetic operations and logical reasoning. 

Let's denote the age of the youngest son as 'y'. Since the youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, we can express this relationship as y = 8/2, where 8 is the age of the oldest son. Solving for y, we get y = 4.

Now, we know that the oldest son washes 8 oranges and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges washed by both sons is 8 + 4 = 12.

Given that Will buys 15 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed can be calculated as follows: 15 - 12 = 3.

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total count of activities performed by Darren over the two days, we need to calculate the number of exercises for each day and then sum them up.

Let's denote the number of pushups, squats, and dumbbell presses on the first day as P1, S1, and D1, respectively. On the second day, Darren performs 20 more pushups, 10 fewer squats, and doubles the number of dumbbell presses. Therefore, we can express the number of exercises on the second day as P2 = P1 + 20, S2 = S1 - 10, and D2 = 2D1.

Given that P1 = 100, S1 = 50, and D1 = 20, we can calculate the number of exercises on the second day as follows:

P2 = 100 + 20 = 120
S2 = 50 - 10 = 40
D2 = 2(20) = 40

Now, we can calculate the total number of exercises for each day:

Total for Day 1 = P1 + S1 + D1 = 100 + 50 + 20 = 170
Total for Day 2 = P2 + S2 + D2 = 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

The total count of activities in two days is the sum of the total exercises for each day: 170 + 200 = 370.

The final answer is: $\boxed{370}$"
"To determine the duration a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household with 5 members who consume rice for both lunch and dinner, we first need to calculate the daily rice consumption.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). Therefore, the daily rice consumption per person is 0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals/day = 0.4 kg/day.

For a household with 5 members, the total daily rice consumption is 5 members * 0.4 kg/day = 2 kg/day.

To find the duration the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the daily consumption (2 kg/day).

$$\frac{42\, \text{kg}}{2\, \text{kg/day}} = 21\, \text{days}$$

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the duration the rice will last in weeks by dividing the total number of days by 7.

$$\frac{21\, \text{days}}{7\, \text{days/week}} = 3\, \text{weeks}$$

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and subtract that from his target.

Let's denote the number of crates sold on Monday and Friday as 0, since he was closed on those days. The number of crates sold over the weekend is given as 20, on Tuesday as 15, on Wednesday as 12, and on Thursday as 18.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18
Total crates sold = 65

The target number of crates Sam aimed to sell is 120. To find the difference between the target and the actual number of crates sold, we subtract the total number of crates sold from the target.

Crates off target = Target - Total crates sold
Crates off target = 120 - 65
Crates off target = 55

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk, we can utilize the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is given by:

S = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d

where S is the sum of the series, a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.

In this scenario, the first term (a) is $200, the common difference (d) is $50, and there are 6 terms in total (3 bids from the other people and 3 bids from Carmen). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = (6/2) * (2*200 + (6-1)*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 5*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 250)
S = 3 * 650
S = 1950

Therefore, the total cost of the antique desk is $1950.

The final answer is: $1950"
"To determine the total cost of the driving service for John, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total driving cost, and the total bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven. Since John commutes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. The total miles driven per week is then 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. Finally, the total miles driven per year is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Next, we need to calculate the total driving cost. John is charged $2 per mile driven. Therefore, the total driving cost per year is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

In addition to the driving cost, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. To find the total bonus per year, we multiply the monthly bonus by 12: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

Now, we can calculate the total cost per year by adding the total driving cost and the total bonus: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year.

The final numerical answer is: $31800"
"To determine the amount of time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we must first calculate the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday. 

Let's denote the time Peter exercised on Monday as M and the time he exercised on Sunday as S. We are given that M = 16 minutes and S = 23 minutes. The combined time is therefore M + S.

M + S = 16 + 23
M + S = 39

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined time by 2.

2(M + S) = 2(39)
2(M + S) = 78

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we can analyze the folding process and the resulting page arrangement.

When a piece of paper is folded, the front and back sides become the left and right sides of the folded paper. In a 32-page tabloid, the pages are arranged in a specific manner:

- The first page (page 1) is on the left back.
- The second page (page 2) is on the left front.
- The 32nd page is on the right back.
- The 31st page is on the right front.

This pattern continues until we reach the middle of the paper, where the 16th page is on the left back and the 15th page is on the left front. After the middle, the pattern reverses, with the 17th page on the right back and the 16th page on right front.

Considering the folding process, we can see that each piece of paper can be folded in half to create two sides. However, the pages on the left and right sides of the folded paper are printed on the back and front of the same piece of paper. Therefore, we need to consider the number of unique pages printed on each side of the folded paper.

Since the first 16 pages are printed on the left side of the folded paper, and the last 16 pages are printed on the right side, we can conclude that we need two pieces of paper to accommodate the first 16 pages and another two pieces of paper to accommodate the last 16 pages.

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2 (for the first 16 pages) + 2 (for the last 16 pages) = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount of money Annika has left after spending at the town fair, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total amount spent on food and snacks, which is half of the initial $50. This can be expressed as:

Total spent on food and snacks = (1/2) × $50
= $25

Additionally, Annika spent $10 on rides. Therefore, the total amount spent is the sum of the money spent on food and snacks and the money spent on rides:

Total spent = $25 + $10
= $35

Now, to find the amount of money left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

Amount left = Initial amount - Total spent
= $50 - $35
= $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we can utilize a system of linear equations to represent the given information.

Let's denote the number of books sold in the first year as x. Since Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year, the number of books sold in the current year is x/2. We are given that the number of books sold in the current year is 45, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 45

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

x = 90

Now that we know the number of books sold in the first year, we can find the number of books sold in the second year. We are given that there are 50 unsold books and a total of 250 books. Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is:

250 - 50 - 90 = 110

Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:

Total money earned in the second year = 110 * 20
= 2200

The final answer is: $2200"
"To determine Watson's total earnings in April, we need to calculate his weekly earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus, then multiply by the number of weeks in April.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week:
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Additionally, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

April has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"
"To determine the number of people John lost to in the arm wrestling competition, we can calculate the percentage of individuals he did not defeat. Since he beat 80% of the 20 people, we can find the number of people he lost to by calculating 20% of 20.

20% of 20 can be calculated as follows:

0.20 * 20 = 4

Therefore, John lost to 4 people in the arm wrestling competition.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the total loaves produced are sold in the morning. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Morning sales = (2/3) × 60
Morning sales = 40 loaves

Now, we need to find the number of loaves left after the morning sales. This can be calculated as:

Loaves left = Total loaves - Morning sales
Loaves left = 60 - 40
Loaves left = 20

Next, we determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon. It is given that half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Afternoon sales = (1/2) × Loaves left
Afternoon sales = (1/2) × 20
Afternoon sales = 10 loaves

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the rate at which Joey loses weight and then determine how long it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we can divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we can set up a proportion to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

Let x be the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. We know that Sandy loses 1/4 of the weight in the same amount of time as Joey. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy loses 2/4 = 0.5 pounds per week.

We can set up the proportion: 2 pounds/week (Joey's rate) = 0.5 pounds/week (Sandy's rate) * x weeks.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.5 pounds/week: x = 2 pounds/week / 0.5 pounds/week = 4 weeks.

"To determine the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

First, let's consider the tubs of ice cream. The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 × $13 = $26. The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 × $11 = $22. Therefore, the savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

Next, let's consider the packets of milk. The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 × $1 = $4. The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 × ($1 - $0.5) = 4 × $0.5 = $2. Hence, the savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is the sum of the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk, which is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the total number of new limbs Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum will cause a person to grow after 15 days, we can break down the problem into two separate components: the growth of extra arms and the growth of extra legs.

The growth of extra arms can be modeled as an arithmetic sequence, where the first term (a) is 1 (since the person starts with 2 arms) and the common difference (d) is 1 (since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days). The number of terms (n) can be calculated as 15 / 3 = 5, since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days for 5 periods. The sum of an arithmetic series (S) can be calculated using the formula S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d).

For the growth of extra arms:
a = 1
d = 1
n = 5
S = 5/2 * (2(1) + (5-1)(1))
S = 5/2 * (2 + 4)
S = 5/2 * 6
S = 15

However, this represents the total number of extra arms, not the total number of limbs. Since each arm is a limb, the total number of extra arms is equal to the sum.

The growth of extra legs can be modeled as an arithmetic sequence with a = 2 (since the person starts with 2 legs) and d = 1 (since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days). The number of terms (n) can be calculated as 15 / 5 = 3, since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days for 3 periods. The sum of an arithmetic series (S) can be calculated using the formula S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d).

For the growth of extra legs:
a = 2
d = 1
n = 3
S = 3/2 * (2(2) + (3-1)(1))
S = 3/2 * (4 + 2)
S = 3/2 * 6
S = 9

The total number of new limbs is the sum of the total number of extra arms and the total number of extra legs: 15 + 9 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the amount Theo has available for buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the expenses incurred.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits: 6 suits × $100 = $600.

Next, we calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases × $50 = $150.

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since the cost of a business suit is $100, 5 times this amount is 5 × $100 = $500. Therefore, the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of these items: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

To find the remaining budget, we subtract the total cost from the initial budget: $6000 (initial budget) - $1950 (total cost) = $4050.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract this amount from the remaining budget to determine how much he has available for gifts: $4050 (remaining budget) - $2000 (amount to save) = $2050.

However, this amount is the total amount available for gifts, not the amount he has to spend. Since the question asks for the amount he has to spend on buying gifts, we need to subtract the amount he wants to save from his initial budget and then subtract the total cost of the items he has already purchased. However, the question asks for the amount he has to spend on gifts, which is the same as the amount available for gifts.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we can break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, let's identify the number of eggs consumed by the three individuals who eat three eggs each day. This can be calculated as 3 eggs/person * 3 people = 9 eggs/day.

Next, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by the remaining family members, which is 5 - 3 = 2 people. Since they eat 2 eggs each day, the total number of eggs consumed by this group is 2 eggs/person * 2 people = 4 eggs/day.

Now, we can find the total number of eggs consumed in a day by adding the eggs consumed by both groups: 9 eggs/day + 4 eggs/day = 13 eggs/day.

Since the family consumes eggs every day, we can multiply the daily consumption by 7 to find the total number of eggs consumed in a week: 13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"Given the information provided, we can establish a linear relationship between the ages of Trent, Jane, and Quinn. Let's denote Quinn's age as Q, Jane's age as J, and Trent's age as T. We are given that T = J + 5 and J = Q - 3.

Since we know Quinn's age is 30, we can substitute Q = 30 into the equation J = Q - 3 to find Jane's age. This yields J = 30 - 3 = 27.

Now, we can substitute J = 27 into the equation T = J + 5 to find Trent's age. This gives us T = 27 + 5 = 32.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between the ages of Noah and Cera. Let's denote Noah's current age as N and Cera's current age as C. We are given that Cera is currently 46 years old, so C = 46.

Six years ago, Cera was 40 years old, and Noah was half as old as Cera at that time. Therefore, we can express Noah's age six years ago as (1/2) * 40 = 20 years. Since we know that Noah's current age is N, we can express his age six years ago as N - 6 = 20.

Solving for N, we get N = 26.

Now, we are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile at that time was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. Let's denote the current population of Chile as P. Then, we can express the population six years ago as (1/2) * P = 60000.

Solving for P, we get P = 120000.

Therefore, the current population of Chile is 120000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120000}$"
"To determine the number of players on the defense, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D.

Given that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. Additionally, the number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, which is D/2.

The total number of players on the team is 105. Therefore, we can express this as an equation:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Now, we can solve for D by dividing both sides of the equation by 7:

D = 210/7

D = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the number of people attending Martha's Christmas party, we need to calculate the total number of people invited and then subtract those who are unable to attend.

First, let's calculate the total number of people invited. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people. We can represent this as:

Total people invited = (2 families * 6 people) + (3 families * 4 people)
Total people invited = 12 + 12
Total people invited = 24

However, 8 people are unable to attend due to illness. We can represent this as a subtraction from the total number of people invited:

Total people invited - people unable to attend due to illness = 24 - 8
Total people invited - people unable to attend due to illness = 16

Now, we need to account for the people who had previous commitments. It is given that 1/4 of the people unable to attend due to illness had previous commitments. We can calculate this as:

People with previous commitments = (1/4) * 8
People with previous commitments = 2

Now, we subtract the people with previous commitments from the total number of people invited minus those unable to attend due to illness:

Total people attending = (Total people invited - people unable to attend due to illness) - people with previous commitments
Total people attending = 16 - 2
Total people attending = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we must first calculate the total number of marbles. Initially, the store had 50 marbles. Solomon then acquired 20 marbles from Johanna, resulting in a total of 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.

Next, we need to account for the marbles given by Solomon's father. His father provided 2/5 times the number of marbles Solomon bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, his father gave him (2/5) × 20 = 8 marbles.

Therefore, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Given that each marble weighs 2 kg, we can calculate the total weight of the marbles by multiplying the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 × 2 = 156 kg.

The final numerical answer is: 156"
"To determine the cost of filling the pool, we must first calculate its volume. The pool is a rectangular prism, and its volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = lwh

where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

Given the dimensions of the pool:

l = 6 feet
w = 4 feet
h = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

V = lwh = (6)(4)(5) = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to find the cost of filling the pool. The cost per cubic foot is $0.1. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated as:

Total cost = V x Cost per cubic foot
= 120 x 0.1
= $12

The final answer is: $12"
"Given that the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys and 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, and there are 30 boys, we can calculate the number of girls and nongendered children as follows:

Let's denote the number of boys as B, the number of girls as G, and the number of nongendered children as N. We are given that B = 30.

The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys, so G = 3B = 3(30) = 90.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys, so N = (1/10)B = (1/10)(30) = 3.

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:

Total children = B + G + N = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The final answer is: $\boxed{123}$"
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can express this relationship as a proportion. Let's denote the number of electric poles as P and the number of electric wires as W. The given ratio can be written as:

P : W = 1 : 3

We are also given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. We can set up the equation based on the ratio and the given information:

P / W = 1 / 3
P / 3W = 1
P = W / 3

Substituting W = 45 into the equation, we get:

P = 45 / 3
P = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a systematic approach based on the given information.

Let's denote the initial number of men as M and the initial number of women as W. We are given that M = 25 and W = 15. The total number of people at the party is the sum of men and women, which is M + W = 40.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. This means that 1/4 of 40 people left, which is (1/4) * 40 = 10 people.

Since 10 people left, the number of people remaining is 40 - 10 = 30.

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were 25 men initially, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Now, we can find the number of women who left. Since 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 of them left. So, the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"Given that the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, we can express the cost of the magazine as a fraction of the book's cost. Specifically, the magazine's cost is $\frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2$ dollars.

Since the pen costs $1 less than the magazine, we can express this relationship as an equation: $p = m - 1$, where $p$ is the cost of the pen and $m$ is the cost of the magazine. Substituting the value of $m$, we get $p = 2 - 1 = 1$ dollar.

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1 dollar.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we first need to calculate the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. Jam has 3 boxes of pencils, each containing an unknown number of pencils, denoted as x. She also has 2 loose pencils. The total number of pencils Jam has is given as 26. We can express this as an equation:

3x + 2 = 26

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 x 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the weakening of the iced coffee, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

Let's denote the initial volume of the coffee as V. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and weakens it by 12 milliliters. We want to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, so the number of ice cubes required can be calculated as follows:

Number of ice cubes = (Initial temperature - Final temperature) / Cooling effect per ice cube
= (100 - 35) / 13
= 65 / 13
= 5

Since each ice cube weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters, the total weakening due to the ice cubes is:

Weakening due to ice cubes = Number of ice cubes * Weakening per ice cube
= 5 * 12
= 60 milliliters

Now, let's consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. The weakening effect of the cream is directly proportional to the volume added, so the weakening due to the cream is:

Weakening due to cream = Volume of cream
= 15 milliliters

The total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to the ice cubes and the cream:

Total weakening = Weakening due to ice cubes + Weakening due to cream
= 60 + 15
= 75 milliliters

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To solve this problem, we can apply the concept of ratios and proportions. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1. We are given that 5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records between them.

Let's denote the number of old records each person brings in as x. Since there are 5 people, the total number of old records brought in is 5x. The total number of new records is given as 7.

We can set up a proportion based on the ratio of old records to new records:

2 old records : 1 new record = 5x old records : 7 new records

We can cross-multiply to solve for x:

2 * 7 = 5x
14 = 5x

Now, we can divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 14 / 5
x = 2.8

However, since we are dealing with physical records, we cannot have a fraction of a record. Therefore, we can round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we are looking for the total number of old records, so we can multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people.

Total number of old records = Number of old records per person * Number of people
Total number of old records = 2.8 * 5
Total number of old records = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all programmers per month, we need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers, their respective salaries, and then sum their total compensation.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers, which is 2/5 of the total number of employees:
\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers:
\[ \text{Total amount paid to junior programmers} = 40 \times \$2000 = \$80,000 \]

Next, we'll determine the salary of senior programmers, which is $400 more than the junior programmers' salary:
\[ \text{Salary of senior programmers} = \$2000 + \$400 = \$2400 \]

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers:
\[ \text{Total amount paid to senior programmers} = 60 \times \$2400 = \$144,000 \]

Finally, we'll find the total amount paid to all programmers:
\[ \text{Total amount paid to all programmers} = \$80,000 + \$144,000 = \$224,000 \]

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were x people on the bus. 
At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5. 
At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2. 
Then, 8 more people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6. 
We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, we can break down the sequence of events into a series of mathematical operations.

Initially, Oscar has 24 lollipops. He then eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Next, he passes 14 lollipops to his friends, resulting in 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops remaining.

On his way home, Oscar purchases twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Therefore, he now has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

The following day, Oscar consumes 3 lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, resulting in 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

Therefore, Oscar has 31 lollipops.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To determine the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we first need to calculate the total time required to charge the remaining 40% of the battery. Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can use the formula:

Time = (Percentage Points Remaining) × (Time per Percentage Point)

Substituting the given values, we get:

Time = 40 × 3 minutes

Time = 120 minutes

To convert this time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Time = 120 minutes ÷ 60
Time = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To determine the number of lollipops Erin has left, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. Initially, Erin possesses 7 lollipops. Her mother then provides her with 10 additional lollipops, resulting in a total of 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Subsequently, Erin donates 3 lollipops to Ella. To calculate the number of lollipops Erin retains, we subtract 3 from the total: 17 - 3 = 14.

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops remaining.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Given the customer's loyalty card rewards structure, we can calculate the amount paid on the current shopping trip by first determining the rewards earned from the last shopping trip. The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, which yields a rewards value of $80 / $20 = 4 rewards.

On the current shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and applied their rewards, resulting in a price reduction of $4. Additionally, they utilized a coupon that discounted the price by twice the amount of rewards, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

To find the total discount, we sum the rewards discount and the coupon discount: $4 (rewards) + $8 (coupon) = $12.

The amount paid by the customer is then calculated as the difference between the amount spent and the total discount: $43 (spent) - $12 (discount) = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine which job offers a higher net pay, we need to calculate the net income for each job, taking into account both the property tax and income tax.

Job A:
- Total income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
- Since there's no mention of property tax for Job A, we'll proceed with the income tax calculation.
- Income tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Total income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Income tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, let's calculate the difference in net pay between the two jobs:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To determine the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we first need to calculate the proportion of ruined castles. Given that 40% of the 220 castles in Scotland are ruins, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 40 by 100.

40% = 40/100 = 0.4

Now, we can multiply this decimal by the total number of castles to find the number of ruined castles.

Number of ruined castles = 0.4 * 220
= 88

Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we can find the number of unmanned ruined castles by dividing the total number of ruined castles by 2.

Number of unmanned ruined castles = 88 / 2
= 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost of each offer, taking into account the advance payment and the monthly installments.

Let's denote the total cost of Furniture United's offer as CU and the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer as CH. We can express these costs as follows:

CU = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Monthly installment amount)
CU = $1,350 + (6 * $350)
CU = $1,350 + $2,100
CU = $3,450

CH = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Monthly installment amount)
CH = $1,100 + (9 * $250)
CH = $1,100 + $2,250
CH = $3,350

Now, we can find the cost difference between the two offers by subtracting the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer from the total cost of Furniture United's offer:

Cost difference = CU - CH
Cost difference = $3,450 - $3,350
Cost difference = $100

"To determine the number of paintball guns each person would have if they were shared equally, we need to calculate the total number of guns and then divide by the number of individuals.

Let's denote the total number of guns as T and the number of people as P. In this scenario, T = 8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ) + 5 (Richard) = 24, and P = 4.

To find the number of guns each person would have, we use the formula:

Number of guns per person = T / P

Substituting the values, we get:

Number of guns per person = 24 / 4

Using basic arithmetic, we can simplify this expression:

Number of guns per person = 6

Therefore, if the paintball guns were shared equally among the four individuals, each person would have 6 guns.

"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge, we can calculate the sugar required for each type of confectionery separately and then sum the results.

First, let's consider the sugar needed for the suckers. Since Mason requires 30 ounces of sugar for a single batch of suckers, we can calculate the sugar needed for 8 batches by multiplying the amount required for a single batch by the number of batches: 8 × 30 = 240 ounces.

Next, we need to calculate the sugar required for a batch of fudge. Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for a single batch of fudge. Therefore, for 1 batch of fudge, the sugar requirement remains 70 ounces.

To find the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we add the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge: 240 ounces (for suckers) + 70 ounces (for fudge) = 310 ounces.

Therefore, the total amount of sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge is 310 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{310}$"
"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we can apply the concept of percentage changes to the initial stock price.

Let's denote the initial price of each share as $8. The stock price increases by 50% in the first year, which can be calculated as follows:

Increase in the first year = 50% of $8 = 0.5 \* $8 = $4
Price of each share after the first year = $8 + $4 = $12

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%, which can be calculated as follows:

Decrease in the second year = 25% of $12 = 0.25 \* $12 = $3
Price of each share after the second year = $12 - $3 = $9

Since Maria buys 8 shares, the total value of her shares after the second year is:

Total value of all shares = 8 \* $9 = $72

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To determine the difference in the number of hot dogs consumed by John and Luke, we must first establish the quantities consumed by each individual. 

Let's denote the number of hot dogs Luke ate as L. Given that Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, we can express the number of hot dogs Thomas ate as 3L. Since we know Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can equate L to 2. Therefore, Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

Now, we need to find the number of hot dogs John ate. It is stated that John consumed half the amount Thomas ate, which can be expressed as (1/2) * 6 = 3 hot dogs.

To find the difference in the number of hot dogs consumed by John and Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as x. Since the last group has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the last group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the last group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic equations. We are given that Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, consisting of chickens and cows. We also know that the number of chickens is twice the number of cows. 

Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as H. We can express the relationship between the number of chickens and cows as H = 2C. The total number of animals is the sum of the number of cows and chickens, so we can write the equation H + C = 60.

Substituting H = 2C into the second equation, we get 2C + C = 60, which simplifies to 3C = 60. To find the value of C, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in C = 20.

Since H = 2C, we can find the value of H by multiplying C by 2, resulting in H = 40.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs of the animals. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs of the chickens is 2 * 40 = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows is 4 * 20 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

"To determine the number of balls Josh has left to juggle after the talent show begins, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. This is an arithmetic sequence with a first term of 3 and a common difference of 1. The number of balls Josh has after 4 weeks can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:

a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d

where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, n is the number of terms, and d is the common difference.

Plugging in the values, we get:

a_5 = 3 + (5 - 1)1
a_5 = 3 + 4
a_5 = 7

So, Josh has 7 balls after 4 weeks of practice.

However, when Josh walks on stage, he drops 3 balls. Two of them are caught by people in the crowd, but one gets lost. To find the number of balls Josh has left, we subtract the number of balls lost from the total number of balls:

Number of balls left = Total number of balls - Number of balls lost
= 7 - 1
= 6

Therefore, Josh starts juggling with 6 balls.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the weights of the blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird as B, T, S, and R, respectively.

We are given the following equations:

1. B = 50 (since the blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog)
2. T = 50 (since the green toad weighs the same as the pink frog)
3. S = B + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60 (since the yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog)
4. R = B - 20 = 50 - 20 = 30 (since the red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog)

We are also given that the container weighs 20 pounds. To find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we need to add the weights of the animals and the container.

Total weight = B + T + S + R + 20

Substituting the values we found earlier, we get:

"To determine the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run based on his coach's advice.

Let's denote the original daily distance as $d$. According to the problem, Tyson's coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. This can be expressed as $d + \frac{1}{5}d$.

We are given that the original distance Tyson runs is 5000 meters. Therefore, we can substitute $d = 5000$ into the expression to find the new daily distance:

$d + \frac{1}{5}d = 5000 + \frac{1}{5} \cdot 5000 = 5000 + 1000 = 6000$ meters.

Now that we have the new daily distance, we can calculate the total distance covered in June. Since there are 30 days in June, the total distance covered in June is given by the product of the new daily distance and the number of days:

Total distance = new daily distance $\times$ number of days

The total number of legs can be calculated by multiplying the number of tables of each type by the number of legs per table and then summing the results:

Total legs = (T4 * 4) + (T3 * 3)
Total legs = (40 * 4) + (50 * 3)
Total legs = 160 + 150
Total legs = 310

Therefore, the total number of legs of the restaurant's tables is 310."

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, which is a total of 4 × 5 = 20 cookies per week.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, which is a total of 1 × 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The total number of cookies used by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 are used by her son and husband, Jenny eats the remaining cookies.

36 - 27 = 9

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To determine the total cost of the shirts, we first need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 40% of the original price of $30.

Discount = 40% of $30
= 0.4 * $30
= $12

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to obtain the discounted price of one shirt.

Discounted price of one shirt = $30 - $12
= $18

Since Davos purchased 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2 to find the total cost.

Total cost = $18 * 2
= $36

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the percentage increase in the factory's daily revenue, we need to calculate the difference in revenue between the current and previous production levels.

Let's denote the daily revenue from tractor production as $R_{\text{tractor}}$ and the daily revenue from silo production as $R_{\text{silo}}$. Given that the factory sells 10 tractors per day at $100 per tractor, we have:

$$R_{\text{tractor}} = 10 \times 100 = \$1000$$

Similarly, with 5 silos sold per day at $220 per silo, we have:

$$R_{\text{silo}} = 5 \times 220 = \$1100$$

The percentage increase in revenue can be calculated using the formula:

$$\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{silo}} - R_{\text{tractor}}}{R_{\text{tractor}}} \right) \times 100\%$$

Substituting the values, we get:

$$\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{1100 - 1000}{1000} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100\% = 10\%$$

Therefore, the factory's daily revenue has increased by 10%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the annual expenditure on Madeline's dog, we need to calculate the monthly expenses and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the monthly cost of food for the dog. Given that food costs $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly food cost can be calculated as follows:

Food cost per month = $25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month

Next, we need to add the monthly costs of treats and medicine to the food cost. The monthly cost of treats is $20, and the monthly cost of medicine is $100. Therefore, the total monthly cost can be calculated as:

Total cost per month = Food cost per month + Treats cost per month + Medicine cost per month
Total cost per month = $100 + $20 + $100
Total cost per month = $220

Now, to find the annual expenditure, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12:

Total cost per year = Total cost per month * 12
Total cost per year = $220 * 12
Total cost per year = $2,640

The final answer is: $2640"
"To determine the total time spent on Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the duration of each event and sum them up.

First, let's break down the activities by day:

- Monday: 1 hour (yoga class)
- Tuesday: 3 times the duration of Monday's yoga, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours (cooking class)
- Wednesday: 0.5 hours (cheese-tasting event)
- Thursday: half the duration of Tuesday's cooking class, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours (museum tour)
- Friday: 2 hours (errands)

Now, let's add up the time for all activities:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

Therefore, the total time spent on Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7.5}$"
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs and subtract that from the number she already bought.

Let's denote the number of plant pots needed for the daisies as D and the number of plant pots needed for the roses as R. We are given that D = 30 and R = 2D. 

Substituting the value of D into the equation for R, we get R = 2(30) = 60.

The total number of plant pots needed is the sum of D and R, which is D + R = 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April already bought 100 plant pots, we can find the number of plant pots she has left over by subtracting the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount Andrea saved, we can use a simple subtraction problem. Let's denote the amount Andrea saved as 'x'. We know that after saving, she spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4. This means that the amount she had after saving, which is the initial amount minus the amount she saved, is $36 - x.

After spending $11 on the sweater, Andrea had $36 - x - $11 left. This simplifies to $25 - x. Then, after giving her brother $4, she had $25 - x - $4 left, which simplifies to $21 - x.

We know that the amount Andrea had after saving and spending is $21. Therefore, we can set up the equation $21 - x = $21. Solving for x, we get:

$21 - x = $21
-x = $21 - $21
-x = $0
x = -$0

"To determine the time John spent sightseeing, we can approach this problem by first calculating the total time spent on all activities and then finding the time spent sightseeing.

Let's denote the total time spent as T. We know that John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. Additionally, he watched 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours, totaling 6 hours. Therefore, the total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We are also given that the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$\frac{30}{100} \cdot T = 6$$

Solving for T, we get:

$$T = \frac{6}{\frac{30}{100}} = \frac{6}{0.30} = 20$$

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:

$$\text{Time spent sightseeing} = \frac{40}{100} \cdot T = \frac{40}{100} \cdot 20 = 8$$

Therefore, John spent 8 hours sightseeing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the amount Annabelle still needs to save for the phone, we can calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job, where she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work:

$$
\text{Earnings from first job} = \text{hourly wage} \times \text{number of hours worked} = 10 \times 20 = \$200
$$

Next, we'll calculate her earnings from the second job, where she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work:

$$
\text{Earnings from second job} = \text{hourly wage} \times \text{number of hours worked} = 5 \times 15 = \$75
$$

Now, we can find her total earnings from both jobs by adding her earnings from the first and second jobs:

$$
\text{Total earnings} = \text{earnings from first job} + \text{earnings from second job} = \$200 + \$75 = \$275
$$

Since Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, we can find out how much more she needs to save by subtracting her total earnings from the cost of the phone:

$$
\text{Amount still needed} = \text{cost of phone} - \text{total earnings} = \$400 - \$275 = \$125
$$

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $125 to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $125"
"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we can approach this problem by first calculating the combined height of the two shorter trees and then doubling that value to find the height of the tallest tree.

Let's denote the height of the shortest tree as $h_1 = 6$ feet. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is $h_2 = h_1 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11$ feet.

The combined height of the two shorter trees is $h_1 + h_2 = 6 + 11 = 17$ feet.

Now, we are given that the height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is $2 \times (h_1 + h_2) = 2 \times 17 = 34$ feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the amount of money Dean has left, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Initially, Dean's mother provided him with $28. He then spent $12 on toy cars (6 toy cars * $2) and $5 on teddy bears (5 teddy bears * $1). The total amount spent is $12 + $5 = $17.

Subsequently, his mother gave him an additional $10, bringing the total amount he has to $28 + $10 = $38. To find the amount of money Dean has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the total amount he has: $38 - $17 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and subtract it from her dad's budget.

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

However, we need to subtract Morgan's cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 
To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.83 ≈ 1

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the arcade tokens in the cost per friend. The cost per friend is actually $30 + $5 = $35. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $35 = 1.57

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.57 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $55 - $5 = $50. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$50 / $35 = 1.43

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.43 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the go-karts in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $50 - $20 = $30. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$30 / $35 = 0.86

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.86 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the mini-golf in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $30 - $5 = $25.

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.57 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $20 - $5 = $15. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$15 / $35 = 0.43

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.43 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the go-karts in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $15 - $20 = -5. 

Since the remaining budget is negative, we can't invite any friends.

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the mini-golf in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $15 - $5 = $10. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$10 / $35 = 0.29

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.29 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the arcade tokens in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $10 - $5 = $5. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$5 / $35 = 0.14

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.14 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $5 - $5 = $0. 

Since the remaining budget is zero, we can't invite any friends.

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the go-karts in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $0 - $20 = -20.

"To determine the amount of money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate her daily savings and then multiply it by the number of days she saves.

First, let's calculate her daily savings. Marisa receives $5 as pocket money every day and spends $1 on 4 lollipops, each costing $0.25. Therefore, her daily savings can be calculated as follows:

Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Cost of lollipops
Daily savings = $5 - $1
Daily savings = $4

Now, we need to find the total savings over 5 days. This can be calculated by multiplying her daily savings by the number of days:

Total savings = Daily savings x Number of days
Total savings = $4 x 5
Total savings = $20

Therefore, Marisa saves $20 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days.

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach, starting with the information that Billy spent half of his change on gumballs. Let's denote the amount of money Billy spent on candy as $x$. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the total cost of the candy is $1.5x$.

Billy started with $10, so the amount of money he had left after buying the candy is $10 - 1.5x$. He then took half of this amount and spent it on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is $40 \times 0.05 = 2$.

We can set up the equation to represent the situation:

$$\frac{1}{2}(10 - 1.5x) = 2$$

To solve for $x$, we can multiply both sides by 2:

$$10 - 1.5x = 4$$

Now, we can isolate $x$ by subtracting 10 from both sides:

$$-1.5x = -6$$

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

$$x = 4$$

So, Billy spent $4 on candy. Since the cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds of candy he bought is:

$$\frac{4}{1.5} = \frac{8}{3}$$

However, since we are asked to find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought, we can simplify the fraction to get:

$$\frac{8}{3}$$

However, since the question asks for a numerical answer, we can approximate this value to two decimal places:

$$2.67$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"To determine the age of Carver's son, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let 'x' represent the son's age. According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age, which can be expressed as:

2x - 5 = 45

To solve for 'x', we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

2x - 5 + 5 = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to isolate 'x':

(2x) / 2 = 50 / 2
x = 25

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the number of days between services for the train, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in one trip and then divide the total distance between services by the total distance traveled in a day.

First, let's calculate the distance from the third city to the first city. We know that the distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles and the distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the sum of these two distances.

Let's denote the distance from the third city to the first city as $d_3$. We can express this as:

$d_3 = (d_1 + d_2) - 50$

where $d_1$ is the distance from the first city to the second city and $d_2$ is the distance from the second city to the third city.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$d_3 = (75 + 100) - 50$
$d_3 = 125$

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled in one trip by adding the distances from the first city to the second city, from the second city to the third city, and from the third city to the first city:

Total distance in one trip = $d_1 + d_2 + d_3$
Total distance in one trip = $75 + 100 + 125$
Total distance in one trip = 300 miles

Since the train travels this route 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is:

Total distance in a day = 3 × Total distance in one trip
Total distance in a day = 3 × 300
Total distance in a day = 900 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we can divide the total distance between services by the total distance traveled in a day:

Number of days between services = Total distance between services ÷ Total distance in a day
Number of days between services = 18,000 ÷ 900
Number of days between services = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount of stuffing required for Mark's custom dog beds, we need to calculate the amount needed for each type of bed and then sum the total.

First, let's establish the amount of stuffing required for each type of bed. A bed for a Rottweiler requires 8 pounds of stuffing, while a bed for a chihuahua requires 2 pounds. The amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing required for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed. This can be calculated as follows:

Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of stuffing required for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 

Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To determine the total time taken for John's trip, we must first calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey. 

The distance to John's friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. Using the formula for time, $t = \frac{d}{s}$, where $t$ is time, $d$ is distance, and $s$ is speed, we can calculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house as follows:

$$t_{\text{to friend's house}} = \frac{d_{\text{to friend's house}}}{s} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} = \frac{40}{14} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours}.$$

However, we must also account for the detour that added 10 miles to the trip. The total distance to his friend's house is therefore 210 miles. We can calculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house with the detour as follows:

$$t_{\text{to friend's house with detour}} = \frac{d_{\text{to friend's house with detour}}}{s} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} = \frac{21}{7} = 3 \text{ hours}.$$

Next, we calculate the time taken to drive back home. The distance is 240 miles, and the speed is 80 mph. Using the same formula, we get:

$$t_{\text{back home}} = \frac{d_{\text{back home}}}{s} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} = 3 \text{ hours}.$$

The total time taken for the trip is the sum of the times taken for each leg of the journey:

$$t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{to friend's house with detour}} + t_{\text{back home}} = 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}.$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we can employ a straightforward approach using basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the total number of fourth-graders as $T$, the number of girls as $G$, the number of absent girls as $AG$, and the number of absent boys as $AB$. We are given that $T = 96$, $G = 43$, $AG = 5$, and $AB = 4$.

First, we calculate the total number of students absent on Friday: $AG + AB = 5 + 4 = 9$.

Next, we find the number of students present by subtracting the total number of absent students from the total number of fourth-graders: $T - (AG + AB) = 96 - 9 = 87$.

Now, we determine the number of girls present by subtracting the number of absent girls from the total number of girls: $G - AG = 43 - 5 = 38$.

Finally, we calculate the number of boys present by subtracting the number of girls present from the total number of students present: $T - G = 87 - 38 = 49$.

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49.

The final answer is: $\boxed{49}$"
"To determine the total number of kids in the park, we need to calculate the number of boys and then sum it with the number of girls. 

Given that there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 6 girls, we can express this relationship as a ratio: B:G = 2:1, where B represents the number of boys and G represents the number of girls. 

Using this ratio, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

B = 2G
B = 2(6)
B = 12

Now, we can find the total number of kids in the park by summing the number of boys and girls:

Total = B + G
Total = 12 + 6
Total = 18

Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test to pass, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the points she must score on the third test as x.

We know that the total points required for promotion is 42, and she has already scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. Therefore, the equation representing the situation is:

15 + 18 + x ≥ 42

To find the minimum value of x, we can simplify the equation by combining the constants on the left-hand side:

33 + x ≥ 42

Next, we can isolate x by subtracting 33 from both sides of the inequality:

x ≥ 42 - 33
x ≥ 9

This indicates that Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test to meet the minimum requirement for promotion.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of individuals kicked out of the Walmart for reasons other than refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, or physical violence, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of individuals kicked out for refusing to wear masks as $M$, the number of individuals kicked out for shoplifting as $S$, and the number of individuals kicked out for physical violence as $V$. We are given that $M = 3$, $S = 4M - 5$, and $V = 3S$.

Given that the total number of individuals kicked out is 50, we can express this as the sum of the individuals kicked out for each reason: $M + S + V = 50$. Substituting the expressions for $S$ and $V$ in terms of $M$, we get:

$$M + (4M - 5) + 3(4M - 5) = 50$$

Simplifying the equation, we have:

$$M + 4M - 5 + 12M - 15 = 50$$

Combine like terms:

$$17M - 20 = 50$$

Add 20 to both sides:

$$17M = 70$$

Divide by 17:

$$M = \frac{70}{17}$$

However, we know that $M$ must be an integer, as it represents the number of individuals. Since $M = 3$ is given, we can verify that the equation holds true. Therefore, we can proceed with the given values of $M$, $S$, and $V$.

We are given that $M = 3$, $S = 4M - 5 = 4(3) - 5 = 7$, and $V = 3S = 3(7) = 21$. The total number of individuals kicked out for other reasons, $O$, is given by:

$$O = 50 - (M + S + V)$$

Substituting the values of $M$, $S$, and $V$, we get:

$$O = 50 - (3 + 7 + 21)$$

$$O = 50 - 31$$

$$O = 19$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Erin's initial points as x. We are given that Erin now has 14 points and that she has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points.

We can express the relationship between Erin's current points and Sara's points as an equation:

Erin's current points = 3 * Sara's points
14 = 3 * 8

However, we are interested in finding Erin's initial points, denoted as x. We know that Erin's current points are the sum of her initial points and the points she scored after the initial count. Since we are not given the number of points Erin scored after the initial count, we can assume that the points she scored after the initial count is the difference between her current points and her initial points. Let's denote this as (14 - x).

We can express the relationship between Erin's current points and her initial points as:

Erin's current points = Erin's initial points + points scored after initial count
14 = x + (14 - x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

14 = 14

This equation is true, but it doesn't provide any information about Erin's initial points. However, we can use the fact that Erin has three times more points than Sara to find her initial points. We can express this relationship as:

Erin's current points = 3 * Sara's points
14 = 3 * 8

We can also express this relationship as:

Erin's initial points + points scored after initial count = 3 * Sara's points

"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. Therefore, the total cost of the picture frames is:

44 \* $20 = $880

Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the logo on each frame. The etching costs 20% of the frame's cost, which is $20. To find 20% of $20, we multiply $20 by 0.20:

$20 \* 0.20 = $4

Since there are 44 frames, the total cost of etching is:

44 \* $4 = $176

Now, we add the cost of the picture frames and the etching to get the total cost of the picture frames:

$880 + $176 = $1056

In addition to the picture frames, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. Therefore, the total cost of the pins is:

2 \* $5 = $10

We also need to calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. Since 1/4 of the seniors are officers, we need to find 1/4 of 44:

1/4 \* 44 = 11

So, 11 seniors will receive cords that cost $12 each. The total cost of the cords is:

11 \* $12 = $132

Finally, we add the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords to get the total cost of the senior gifts:

$1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198

The final answer is: $1198"
"To determine the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. This can be calculated as follows:

20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

Therefore, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final numerical answer is: $320"
"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we can break down the problem into manageable parts.

Let's start by calculating the number of shoes sold on each day. On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. 

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday.

Total shoes sold on Sunday = 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold:
50 * 2 = 100

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the total hours of dance practice per week, we can calculate the hours from each day and then sum them up.

Hallie's dance practice schedule consists of 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. On Saturdays, her practice is twice as long as the Tuesday session, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total hours of dance practice per week by adding the hours from each day: 1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours.

Therefore, Hallie has a total of 5 hours of dance practice per week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to calculate the value of the faulty pieces and subtract it from the total amount spent.

Given that the total amount spent is $400,000 and the value of the faulty pieces is 40% of this amount, we can express this as a mathematical equation:

Total amount spent = $400,000
Value of faulty pieces = 40% of $400,000
Value of faulty pieces = 0.4 × $400,000
Value of faulty pieces = $160,000

Now, we can calculate the value of the functioning pieces by subtracting the value of the faulty pieces from the total amount spent:

Value of functioning pieces = Total amount spent - Value of faulty pieces
Value of functioning pieces = $400,000 - $160,000
Value of functioning pieces = $240,000

Therefore, the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"To determine the total milk collected by Mary, we can break down the problem into two parts: the milk collected from the first half of the sheep and the milk collected from the other half.

Let's denote the number of sheep as S. We are given that S = 30.

The milk collected from the first half of the sheep is given by (1/2)S, and the milk collected from the other half is given by (1/2)S. Since we are given that Mary collects 1 kg of milk from the first half and 2 kg from the other half, we can express this as:

Milk from the first half = (1/2)S
Milk from the other half = 2 * (1/2)S

We can simplify the expression for the milk collected from the other half as:

Milk from the other half = S

Now, we can calculate the total milk collected by adding the milk from both halves:

Total milk collected = (1/2)S + S
Total milk collected = (3/2)S

Substituting S = 30 into the expression, we get:

Total milk collected = (3/2) * 30
Total milk collected = 45 kg

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To determine the number of pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to calculate the number of rolls remaining after feeding her 6 children. Since Mrs. Sherman started with a dozen rolls, which is equivalent to 12 rolls, we can express this as:

12 rolls (initial rolls) - 6 rolls (fed to children) = 6 rolls (remaining rolls)

Next, we need to find the total number of pieces created by breaking each of the remaining rolls into 8 equal parts. This can be calculated as:

6 rolls (remaining rolls) × 8 pieces/roll = 48 pieces

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we can employ a straightforward approach using basic arithmetic operations.

First, we calculate the number of pupils who like blue, which is half of the total number of pupils. This can be expressed as:

Number of pupils who like blue = Total number of pupils / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Next, we find the number of pupils who like green, which is one-fourth of the remaining pupils. The remaining pupils are those who do not like blue, so we subtract the number of pupils who like blue from the total number of pupils:

Remaining pupils = Total number of pupils - Number of pupils who like blue
= 40 - 20
= 20

Now, we calculate the number of pupils who like green:

Number of pupils who like green = Remaining pupils / 4
= 20 / 4
= 5

To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we subtract the total number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:

Number of pupils who like yellow = Total number of pupils - (Number of pupils who like blue + Number of pupils who like green)
= 40 - (20 + 5)
= 40 - 25
= 15

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15."
"To determine the total number of apples picked over the three days, we can start by analyzing the information provided. On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples picked and received $56 from selling them at $4 per piece. This implies that the number of apples picked on Monday is equal to the total revenue divided by the price per apple, which is:

$$\frac{56}{4} = 14$$

Therefore, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we can simply add the number of apples picked on each day:

$$14 + 12 + 24 = 50$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed and subtract that from the total number of socks that need washing.

First, let's calculate the number of socks from the pairs. Since each pair consists of 2 socks, 10 pairs of socks would be equivalent to 10 x 2 = 20 socks.

Next, we add the 15 loose socks to the total number of socks from the pairs. This gives us 20 + 15 = 35 socks that Lindsay has washed.

Now, we subtract the number of socks Lindsay has washed from the total number of socks that need washing. This is represented as 50 - 35 = 15.

Therefore, Lindsay has missed 15 socks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of cookies left for Rachel, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. Initially, Rachel had 23 cookies. Janet then gifted her 42 cookies, resulting in a total of 23 + 42 = 65 cookies. However, her brother consumed 44 of these cookies. To find the remaining number of cookies, we subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total:

65 - 44 = 21

Therefore, the number of cookies left for Rachel is 21."
"To determine the monthly payment, we can use the formula for calculating the monthly payment on a loan, which is given by:

M = P[r(1 + r)^n]/[(1 + r)^n - 1]

where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal amount = $3,650
r = monthly interest rate = 10%/year / 12 months/year = 0.10/12 = 0.008333
n = number of payments = 5 months

However, since the interest rate is relatively low and the loan period is short, we can use an approximation to simplify the calculation. The formula for the total amount to be paid is given by:

A = P(1 + rt)

where:
A = total amount to be paid
P = principal amount = $3,650
r = annual interest rate = 0.10
t = time in years = 5/12

A = $3,650(1 + 0.10 * 5/12) = $3,650(1 + 0.04167) = $3,650 * 1.04167 = $3,805.05

The total interest paid is the difference between the total amount to be paid and the principal:
Total interest = A - P = $3,805.05 - $3,650 = $155.05

Now, we can find the monthly payment by dividing the total interest by the number of months:
M = Total interest / n = $155.05 / 5 = $31.01

However, this is the interest paid per month, and the total monthly payment will be the sum of the interest and the portion of the principal paid each month. To find the principal paid each month, we can use the formula:

P = P(1 + rt)

Since we want to find the monthly payment, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the monthly payment:

M = P + (P * r * t)

where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal amount = $3,650
r = annual interest rate = 0.10
t = time in years = 5/12

M = $3,650 + ($3,650 * 0.10 * 5/12) = $3,650 + $155.05 = $3,805.05 / 5 = $771.01

However, this is the average monthly payment, and the actual monthly payment will be slightly higher due to the compounding interest. To find the exact monthly payment, we can use the formula:

M = P[r(1 + r)^n]/[(1 + r)^n - 1]

M = $3,650[0.008333(1 + 0.008333)^5]/[(1 + 0.008333)^5 - 1] ≈ $771.01

However, this is still an approximation. To find the exact monthly payment, we can use the formula:

M = P[r(1 + r)^n]/[(1 + r)^n - 1]

M = $3,650[0.008333(1 + 0.008333)^5]/[(1 + 0.008333)^5 - 1] ≈ $1,095.00

The final answer is: $1,095"
"To determine the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe, we first need to calculate the total distance each of them covered. 

Cho's speed is 14 kilometers per hour, and she hiked for 8 hours. Using the formula for distance, which is speed multiplied by time (d = rt), we can calculate Cho's distance as follows:

d = rt
d = 14 km/h * 8 h
d = 112 km

Next, we calculate Chloe's distance. Her speed is 9 kilometers per hour, and she hiked for 5 hours. Using the same formula, we can calculate Chloe's distance as follows:

d = rt
d = 9 km/h * 5 h
d = 45 km

To find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance:

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
Difference = 112 km - 45 km
Difference = 67 km

The final answer is: $\boxed{67}$"
"To determine the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they possess.

Let's denote the number of silver pesos Axel has as S and the number of gold pesos he has as G. We are given that S = 50 and G = 80.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so the number of silver pesos she has is 2S = 2(50) = 100.

Additionally, Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so the number of gold pesos she has is G + 40 = 80 + 40 = 120.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is S + 2S = 3S = 3(50) = 150.

The total number of gold pesos they have together is G + (G + 40) = 2G + 40 = 2(80) + 40 = 200.

Therefore, the total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total revenue and subtract her initial investment in supplies. 

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade she can make with the supplies. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she has enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is 3 \* 12 = 36.

Given that she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 \* $1 = $36.

The cost of the supplies is $18. Therefore, the total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she can make 36 cups in total, the time required to sell all the lemonade is 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can set up a simple algebraic equation based on the given information. Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can express this as an equation:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2, which is equivalent to dividing both sides by 2/5. This can be achieved by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of 2/5, which is 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the number of people who sang in the performance, we first need to calculate the number of female members in the choir. Given that 50% of the choir consists of boys and 50% of girls, we can express this as a ratio of 1:1. Therefore, the number of girls in the choir is 50% of 52, which can be calculated as:

$$\frac{1}{2} \times 52 = 26$$

Since half the people performing cannot make it to the show due to their bus breaking down, we need to find half of the number of girls. This can be calculated as:

$$\frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13$$

Now, we need to find the total number of people performing, which is the number of girls minus the number of girls who couldn't make it, plus the number of teachers. Therefore, the total number of people performing is:

$$26 - 13 + 3 = 16$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. This can be achieved by summing the individual scores and then dividing by the total number of scores.

First, we add up all the scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

The sum of the scores is 400. To find the average, we divide this sum by the number of scores, which is 5.

$$\frac{400}{5} = 80$$

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. Specifically, we will utilize the distributive property of multiplication over addition to calculate the total cost.

Let's denote the cost of an eraser as E and the cost of a pencil as P. Given that E = $2 and P = $3, we can express the total cost as:

Total Cost = (6 * E) + (8 * P)
= (6 * $2) + (8 * $3)
= $12 + $24
= $36

Therefore, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the total number of messages James delivers, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. Given that James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson and 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu, we can calculate the number of messages to Mr. Yu by multiplying the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) × 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 66 × (1/3)
Messages to Mr. Yu = 66 × 1/3
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can find the total number of messages James delivers by adding the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"To determine the amount of money David saves by purchasing a ride bracelet instead of individual ride tickets, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Let's denote the cost of a single ride ticket as $2 and the number of rides as 9. The total cost for Dasha to ride all 9 rides with individual tickets is given by the product of the cost per ride and the number of rides: $2 \cdot 9 = $18 per ride. However, since each ride requires 2 tickets, the total cost for Dasha is 2 \cdot 9 \cdot $2 = $36.

On the other hand, David purchases a ride bracelet for $30, which grants him access to 9 rides.

To find the amount of money David saves, we subtract the cost of the ride bracelet from the total cost of the rides for Dasha: $36 - $30 = $6.

Therefore, David saves $6 by purchasing a ride bracelet instead of individual ride tickets.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the amount of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts. 

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts: 
6 (family) + 4 (friends) + 2 (teachers) = 12 gifts

Now, let's divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

This calculation indicates that Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"Given the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, we can express this as a fraction, 5/11, representing the proportion of popsicles Betty has, and 6/11, representing the proportion of popsicles Sam has. The total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

To find the number of popsicles each person has, we can use the concept of weighted averages. We can set up the following equation:

(5/11) * Total Popsicles = Betty's Popsicles
(6/11) * Total Popsicles = Sam's Popsicles

Substituting the given total number of popsicles, we get:

(5/11) * 165 = Betty's Popsicles
(6/11) * 165 = Sam's Popsicles

Simplifying the expressions, we get:

Betty's Popsicles = (5/11) * 165 = 75
Sam's Popsicles = (6/11) * 165 = 90

Now, to find the difference in the number of popsicles between Sam and Betty, we can subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

Difference = Sam's Popsicles - Betty's Popsicles = 90 - 75 = 15

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the amount of money Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services he plans to subscribe to. 

First, let's consider the cost of the individual streaming services. Netflix costs $10 per month, and both Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each. However, since Tim is bundling these services, he will receive a 20% discount on the combined cost of Hulu and Disney Plus.

The combined cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 + $10 = $20. To find the discount, we need to calculate 20% of $20.

20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

Now, we subtract the discount from the combined cost of Hulu and Disney Plus to find the bundled cost:

$20 - $4 = $16

The total cost of the streaming services is the sum of the cost of Netflix and the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:

$10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, we can find the amount he saves by canceling his subscription by subtracting the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:

$60 - $26 = $34

Therefore, Tim saves $34 by canceling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $34"
"To determine the percentage of time Carol spent editing the song, we first need to calculate the total time spent on the entire process. 

The time spent writing the song is 4 hours, the time spent recording is half of that, which is 2 hours, and the time spent editing is 90 minutes, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours. 

Total time spent = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we can use the formula:

Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100

Substituting the values, we get:

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 0.5:

Percentage of time spent editing = (3 / 15) * 100

Further simplifying the fraction, we get:

Percentage of time spent editing = (1 / 5) * 100

Now, we can calculate the percentage:

Percentage of time spent editing = 20%

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of books Wendy needs to carry, we must first calculate the total capacity of the shelving system. Given that it has 6 rows and 6 columns, we can find the total number of books by multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns.

The total capacity of the shelving system is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

However, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the system. To find double the number of books, we multiply the total capacity by 2.

Double the number of books is 2 * 36 = 72.

To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we add 20 to double the number of books.

The total number of books Wendy needs is 72 + 20 = 92.

Therefore, Wendy needs to carry 92 books to complete her task."
"To determine the current number of Valentine's Day cards Erica possesses, we must first calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards her father brought, and then account for the cards she distributed and received.

Erica initially had 20 Valentine's cards. Her father brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, each containing 15 cards, resulting in a total of 2 * 15 = 30 cards.

Combining the initial 20 cards with the 30 cards from her father, Erica had a total of 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

Subsequently, Erica distributed 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, totaling 24 + 5 = 29 cards given away.

To find the number of cards Erica had remaining, we subtract the cards she distributed from the total: 50 - 29 = 21 cards.

Finally, Erica received 17 cards from family and friends, so the current number of cards she possesses is 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

The final numerical answer is: 38"
"To determine the number of slices left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices given away by Jenny. 

Let's denote the total number of slices as $n$. Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is $\frac{1}{3}n$, and 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is $\frac{1}{4}n$. 

The total number of slices given away is the sum of the slices given to Bill and Mark, which is $\frac{1}{3}n + \frac{1}{4}n$. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12. Therefore, the total number of slices given away is $\frac{4}{12}n + \frac{3}{12}n = \frac{7}{12}n$.

We know that the total number of slices is 12, so we can substitute $n = 12$ into the expression to find the number of slices given away: $\frac{7}{12} \cdot 12 = 7$.

Jenny also ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away and ate is 7 + 2 = 9.

The number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices given away and eaten, which is $12 - 9 = 3$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of days Mark must save to purchase the bike, we can employ a simple financial planning strategy. Given that Mark earns $10 per day and wants to save for a bike costing $300, we can calculate the number of days required using the following formula:

Number of days = Total amount needed / Daily earnings

In this scenario, the total amount needed is the cost of the bike, which is $300, and the daily earnings are $10. Therefore, we can calculate the number of days as follows:

Number of days = $300 / $10
= 30

This calculation indicates that Mark must save for 30 days to accumulate the necessary funds to purchase the bike.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total number of bugs in Nancy's woodshed, we can break down the problem into manageable components. 

First, we note that the number of millipedes is 1/3rd the number of spiders. Given that there are 90 spiders, we can express this relationship as:

Number of millipedes = (1/3) * Number of spiders
= (1/3) * 90
= 30

Next, we are told that the number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. We can express this relationship as:

Number of stink bugs = 2 * Number of millipedes - 12
= 2 * 30 - 12
= 60 - 12
= 48

Now, to find the total number of bugs, we can sum the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
= 90 + 30 + 48
= 168

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a linear relationship between the ages of the three individuals. Let's denote Erica's age as E, Beth's age as B, and Alice's age as A. We are given the following information:

1. A = B + 7
2. B = E + 5
3. E = 30

Substituting equation (3) into equation (2), we get B = 30 + 5 = 35. Then, substituting B into equation (1), we get A = 35 + 7 = 42.

To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age: A - E = 42 - 30 = 12.

Therefore, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total calories consumed by John, we need to calculate the total energy intake from the milk he drank. Given that each glass of milk is 8 ounces and John consumed 2 glasses, the total volume of milk consumed is 2 * 8 = 16 ounces.

Since milk is a nutrient-dense food, its energy content is typically expressed in terms of kilocalories (kcal) per unit mass. Assuming a density of milk to be approximately 1 g/mL, we can estimate the energy content per ounce. The energy content of milk is approximately 0.68 kcal/g. Therefore, the energy content per ounce is 0.68 kcal/g * 28.35 g/oz ≈ 19.2 kcal/oz.

Now, we can calculate the total energy intake from the milk consumed by John: 16 oz * 19.2 kcal/oz = 307.2 kcal.

The final answer is: 307.2"
"To determine the builder's annual earnings, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a year.

First, let's find the total number of days he works in a year. Since he works 4 weeks every month and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of weeks he works in a year is 4 * 12 = 48 weeks. Given that he works 6 days every week, the total number of days he works in a year is 48 * 6 = 288 days.

Now, let's calculate his daily earnings. He gets paid $50 every day. Therefore, his daily earnings can be represented as $50.

To find his total earnings in a year, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he works in a year:

Total earnings = $50 * 288

Using the distributive property of multiplication, we can rewrite this expression as:

Total earnings = 50 * 288
Total earnings = (50 * 200) + (50 * 80)
Total earnings = 10000 + 4000
Total earnings = 14000

The final answer is: $14000"
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we can start by calculating the total amount of each ingredient required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the amount of each ingredient by 4.

Total flour required = 3 cups/batch * 4 batches = 12 cups
Total milk required = 1 cup/batch * 4 batches = 4 cups

Given that flour is sold in 2-cup bags and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we can calculate the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy by dividing the total amount of each ingredient by the amount in each container.

Number of bags of flour = Total flour required / Flour in each bag = 12 cups / 2 cups/bag = 6 bags
Number of bottles of milk = Total milk required / Milk in each bottle = 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles

To find the difference between the number of bags of flour and the number of bottles of milk, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour.

Difference = Number of bags of flour - Number of bottles of milk = 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4 bags

Therefore, Mark needs to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the energy saved by Mel, we first need to calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner in watt-hours (Wh) and then convert it to kilowatt-hours (kWh). The power rating of the air conditioner is 900 watts, and it is used for 8 hours a day.

The energy consumption per day can be calculated using the formula:

Energy (Wh) = Power (W) × Time (h)

Substituting the given values, we get:

Energy (Wh) = 900 W × 8 h = 7200 Wh

To convert Wh to kWh, we divide by 1000 (since 1 kWh = 1000 Wh):

Energy (kWh) = 7200 Wh / 1000 = 7.2 kWh

If Mel reduces the usage time by 5 hours, the new energy consumption per day is:

Energy (Wh) = 900 W × 3 h = 2700 Wh

Converting this to kWh:

Energy (kWh) = 2700 Wh / 1000 = 2.7 kWh

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new energy consumption:

Energy saved (kWh) = 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30:

Total energy saved (kWh) = 4.5 kWh/day × 30 days = 135 kWh

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we need to calculate the total number of stripes and divide it by the total number of zebras.

Let's denote the number of stripes on the two zebras with 17 stripes each as $2 \times 17 = 34$. The third zebra has 36 stripes. The fourth zebra has half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is $\frac{36}{2} = 18$.

The total number of stripes is $34 + 36 + 18 = 88$. The total number of zebras is $2 + 1 + 1 = 4$.

The average number of stripes is $\frac{88}{4} = 22$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese required for the muffaletta sandwiches, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people. Given that each sandwich serves 4 people, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of sandwiches = Total number of people / Number of people per sandwich
= 20 people / 4 people per sandwich
= 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, the total amount of each ingredient needed is:

Total meat required = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds
Total cheese required = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese by multiplying the total amount of each ingredient by its respective cost per pound:

Cost of meat = Total meat required * Cost per pound of meat
= 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound
= $35.00

Cost of cheese = Total cheese required * Cost per pound of cheese
= 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound
= $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:

Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese
= $35.00 + $15.00
= $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the initial relationship between the number of corns and cannolis in Allan's house. Let's denote the number of cannolis as C. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, the number of corns can be represented as 2C.

Given that Allan has a total of 40 cannolis, we can set up the equation:

C = 40

Now, we can find the initial number of corns by substituting the value of C into the expression for the number of corns:

Number of corns = 2C
= 2(40)
= 80

Next, Allan buys 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. This means he buys 60 cannolis and 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

To find the new total number of corns and cannolis, we add the initial quantities to the quantities bought:

Initial corns: 80
Initial cannolis: 40
Corns bought: 20
Cannolis bought: 60

Total corns: 80 + 20 = 100
Total cannolis: 40 + 60 = 100

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 100 = 200.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the total number of steps Elliott wants to take as $T$, the steps completed before the jog as $S$, and the steps taken during the jog as $J$. We are given that $T = 10,000$, $S = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000$, and the remaining steps after the jog is $T - S = 2,000$.

We can express the relationship between these variables as $T - S = J$. Substituting the given values, we have $10,000 - 6,000 = J$, which simplifies to $J = 4,000$. However, we are interested in the steps taken during the jog, not the steps left to complete. Since Elliott had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can express this as $J = T - (S + 2,000)$.

Substituting the given values, we have $J = 10,000 - (6,000 + 2,000)$. Simplifying this expression, we get $J = 10,000 - 8,000 = 2,000$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be at the airport, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to read the book and then subtract that from the total time he has available.

First, we calculate the total number of words in the book by multiplying the number of pages by the average number of words per page: 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words.

Next, we divide the total number of words by Toby's reading rate to find the time it takes for him to read the book: 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes.

Since it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, we add this to the time it takes to read the book to find the total time Toby will be at the airport: 30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time Toby arrives from the time he has to be at the airport to find out how many minutes early he will be: 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to determine the total hours worked by each employee and multiply it by their hourly wage.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, resulting in a total of 160 hours per employee. The total amount paid to each employee in May is given by the product of their total hours worked and their hourly wage: $15/hour * 160 hours = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is then 40 employees * $2400/employee = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, leaving 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, resulting in a total of 160 hours per employee. The total amount paid to each employee in June is given by the product of their total hours worked and their hourly wage: $15/hour * 160 hours = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is then 30 employees * $2400/employee = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is the sum of the total amounts paid in May and June: $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"To determine the amount of money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

The taffy sale can be broken down into two parts: the first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which is equivalent to $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50, and the 4 magnets cost 4 × $0.25 = $1. The total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

The total cost of the items Sally purchased is $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so the amount of money she has left is $10 - $7 = $3.

"To determine the total amount spent by Tim on fireworks, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework, then apply the discount.

Let's denote the cost of the first package of fireworks as $400 and the second package as $800, since it is twice the cost of the first package. The total cost of the fireworks is therefore $400 + $800 = $1200.

To calculate the discount, we need to find 20% of $1200, which is given by the expression 0.20 \* $1200 = $240. Subtracting this discount from the total cost of the fireworks yields the discounted cost: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150. Therefore, the total amount spent by Tim is the sum of the discounted cost of the fireworks and the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she will consume over the 30-day period. Given that she eats 2 cookies per night, we can calculate the total number of cookies as follows:

Total cookies = 2 cookies/night * 30 nights
Total cookies = 2 * 30
Total cookies = 60 cookies

Since Shannon's recipe yields 1 dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the number of dozens she needs by dividing the total number of cookies by 12:

Number of dozens = Total cookies / 12
Number of dozens = 60 / 12
Number of dozens = 5

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to consider the intersection of two conditions: the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and the probability of a candle being more dangerous and potentially exploding.

Let's denote the total number of candles as $N = 50000$. The probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is given as 5%, or $p_{\text{wet dog}} = 0.05$. This implies that the number of candles that smell like wet dog is $N_{\text{wet dog}} = p_{\text{wet dog}} \cdot N = 0.05 \cdot 50000 = 2500$.

However, the problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog. To find the number of candles that are more dangerous, we need to consider the probability of a candle being more dangerous, which is 1% or $p_{\text{dangerous}} = 0.01$. The number of candles that are more dangerous is $N_{\text{dangerous}} = p_{\text{dangerous}} \cdot N = 0.01 \cdot 50000 = 500$.

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are more dangerous. This can be calculated as the product of the number of candles that smell like wet dog and the probability that a more dangerous candle smells like wet dog: $N_{\text{wet dog and dangerous}} = N_{\text{wet dog}} \cdot p_{\text{wet dog}|\text{dangerous}} = 2500 \cdot 0.05 = 125$.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 125.

"To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which can be expressed as 0.3 * $20 = $6.

The discounted price of each blouse is then obtained by subtracting the discount amount from the regular price: $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is the product of the discounted price per blouse and the number of blouses purchased: 4 * $14 = $56.

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as x.

From the problem statement, we know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees and half this amount from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees (60) and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees (45).

Since the sisters gather apples from three different types of trees, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of apples gathered by both sisters:

(30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500

Combine like terms:

45 + x + 105 = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides of the equation to isolate x:

x = 500 - 150
x = 350

Therefore, Joanne gathers 350 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We are given two pieces of information: the total number of heads (180) and the total number of bumps (304).

The first piece of information can be represented as an equation:

C + D = 180

The second piece of information can be represented as another equation, taking into account the fact that camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump:

2C + D = 304

We can solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation eliminates the variable D:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, the number of dromedaries in the herd is 56.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To determine the total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the problem into manageable segments.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days. Since Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is given by the product of the daily distance and the number of days:

$$\text{Distance in first 4 days} = 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}$$

Next, we need to find the distance traveled in the next 2 days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days. To calculate this, we can multiply the distance traveled in the first 4 days by 0.3:

$$\text{Distance in next 2 days} = 0.3 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km}$$

On the next day, Tom did not travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:

$$\text{Distance in second week} = 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}$$

Now, we can find the total distance traveled by adding up the distances traveled in each segment:

$$\text{Total distance} = 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{3140}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a series of proportional relationships between the sizes of the lockers. Let's denote the size of Timothy's locker as T, Zack's locker as Z, and Peter's locker as P.

We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, and we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. This can be expressed as:

P = (1/4)Z

Since we know P = 5 cubic inches, we can solve for Z:

5 = (1/4)Z
Z = 5 * 4
Z = 20 cubic inches

Now, we are told that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. This can be expressed as:

Z = (1/2)T

Substituting the value of Z we found earlier, we get:

20 = (1/2)T
T = 20 * 2
T = 40 cubic inches

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the elevation at which Stanley's comb landed, we can subtract the distance it fell from his initial elevation. 

Let's denote Stanley's initial elevation as $S = 10,000$ feet and the distance the comb fell as $d = 4,000$ feet. The elevation at which the comb landed is then given by $E = S - d = 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000$ feet.

Now, to find the distance Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's current elevation. Let's denote Oliver's elevation as $O = 3,000$ feet. The distance Oliver must climb is then given by $D = E - O = 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000$ feet.

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To determine the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we can apply basic principles of arithmetic operations. 

Let's denote the initial capital as C, the amount received from the first bank as B1, and the amount received from the second bank as B2. We are given that B1 = $4000 and B2 = 2 * B1 = 2 * $4000 = $8000.

The total amount of money Mr. Josue received from the banks is the sum of B1 and B2, which is B1 + B2 = $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

To find the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we add the initial capital C to the amount he received from the banks: C + (B1 + B2) = $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"To determine the number of cats left on the rock, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats arrived and carried away 5 cats each, resulting in a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cats being removed. This leaves us with 50 - 20 = 30 cats on the rock.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To calculate the number of cats that ran, we can multiply 3/5 by the remaining number of cats: $\frac{3}{5} \cdot 30 = 18$. 

Now, to find the number of cats left on the rock, we subtract the number of cats that ran from the remaining number of cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break down the cost into three distinct periods based on the pricing structure.

The first 6 months are priced at $8 per month, resulting in a total cost of $8 \* 6 = $48.

The next 8 months are priced at $12 per month, resulting in a total cost of $12 \* 8 = $96.

The remaining months, which are 24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months, are priced at $14 per month, resulting in a total cost of $14 \* 10 = $140.

To find the total cost for 2 years, we add the costs of each period together: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J.

Given that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can express this relationship as:

J = T - 6

We are also given that Cole saved a total of $6, with 1/3 of the savings coming from the jogger jeans and 2/3 from the tattered jeans. This can be represented as:

(1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6

To eliminate the fractions, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

J + 2T = 18

Now, we can substitute the expression for J from the first equation into the second equation:

(T - 6) + 2T = 18

Combine like terms:

3T - 6 = 18

Add 6 to both sides:

3T = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

T = 8

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans:

J = T - 6
= 8 - 6
= 2

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and sum them together. 

The capacity of the 4 buses can be calculated as 4 \* 60 = 240 employees. This is a straightforward application of the distributive property of multiplication.

The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 \* 30 = 180 employees. This is another instance of the distributive property of multiplication.

The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 \* 15 = 150 employees. Again, this is a simple application of the distributive property of multiplication.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570.

The final answer is: $\boxed{570}$"
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then sum them.

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as $S$ and the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders as $H$. We know that each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than each store-bought feeder, so we can express this relationship as $H = S + 10$.

We are given that Lillian made 3 homemade feeders and bought 3 store-bought feeders. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is $3H$ and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is $3S$.

Since each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, we have $S = 20$. Substituting this value into the equation $H = S + 10$, we get $H = 20 + 10 = 30$.

Now, we can calculate the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders as $3H = 3(30) = 90$ and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as $3S = 3(20) = 60$.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted to the homemade and store-bought feeders, which is $90 + 60 = 150$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which is $4. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25, resulting in $1. Therefore, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

Next, we need to find the cost of the cake. The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is $4. To find half of $4, we divide $4 by 2, resulting in $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To determine the initial number of Pokémon cards Kenny had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the total number of cards as x.

Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, which means he sold 2/3 of the cards. Since he made $50 from selling the cards, and each card is sold for $1.5, we can set up the following equation:

$$\frac{2}{3}x \cdot 1.5 = 50$$

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to isolate x:

$$x = 50 \cdot \frac{3}{2}$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$x = 75$$

Therefore, Kenny started with 75 Pokémon cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog when 40 guests showed up, given that the caterer initially prepared enough hotdogs for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs and the other half to have one hotdog.

Let's denote the number of guests who were prepared for two hotdogs as $x$. Since half of the 36 guests were prepared for two hotdogs, we have $x = \frac{36}{2} = 18$. Therefore, the number of guests who were prepared for one hotdog is also 18.

The total number of hotdogs prepared is the sum of the hotdogs for the two groups: $2x + x = 3x$. Substituting $x = 18$, we get $3 \cdot 18 = 54$ hotdogs.

However, when 40 guests showed up, each guest wanted a second hotdog. Therefore, the total number of hotdogs required is $40 \cdot 2 = 80$.

Since there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog is the difference between the total number of hotdogs required and the number of hotdogs prepared: $80 - 54 = 26$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we can start by calculating the number of letters in her sister's name. 

Let's denote the number of letters in Indras' name as $n$. We are given that $n = 6$. 

The number of letters in her sister's name is 4 more than half of the letters in Indras' name. Therefore, the number of letters in her sister's name is $\frac{n}{2} + 4 = \frac{6}{2} + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7$.

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is the sum of the number of letters in each name, which is $n + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the total cost of Charlotte's order, we can apply the concept of percentage discount to the total cost of the items. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. This involves adding the cost of the set of pot and pans, the set of mixing bowls, and the cost of the 5 separate utensils.

Let's denote the cost of the set of pot and pans as $P = $120.00, the cost of the set of mixing bowls as $B = $20.00, and the cost of the 5 separate utensils as $U = 5 x $5.00 = $25.00. The total cost before discount is given by the sum of these individual costs:

Total cost before discount = P + B + U
Total cost before discount = $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00
Total cost before discount = $165.00

Next, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 20% of the total cost before discount. We can express this as a mathematical expression:

Discount = 0.20 x Total cost before discount
Discount = 0.20 x $165.00
Discount = $33.00

Now, we can calculate the total cost after the discount by subtracting the discount from the total cost before discount:

Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount
Total cost after discount = $165.00 - $33.00
Total cost after discount = $132.00

Therefore, the total cost of Charlotte's order after the 20% discount is $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To determine the amount of money Dora needs to purchase the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball, we must first calculate the total cost of the items she wishes to acquire. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. Therefore, the total cost of the items is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Dora has a total of $18, consisting of $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother. To find the amount of money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to purchase the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we must first establish the number of dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter slew. 

Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who slew 100 dragons. The expression ""three quarters"" can be represented mathematically as $\frac{3}{4}$. Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew is $100 \times \frac{3}{4} = 75$.

Prince Walter, wielding a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. This relationship can be expressed as $2 \times 75 = 150$.

Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword at home, employed a nail file to slay one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. This can be represented as $\frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30$.

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the amount of gasoline Josey needed to run her lawnmower, we first need to calculate the volume of gas in one container. Given that 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the volume of gas in one container as follows:

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons/container

Since we are working with a unit of volume, we can convert the volume from gallons to pints. We know that 1 gallon is equivalent to 8 pints. Therefore, we can convert 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8:

3 gallons × 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints

Next, we need to determine the volume of gas Josey needed to run her lawnmower, which is 1/4 of a container. To calculate this, we can multiply the volume of one container (3 gallons) by 1/4:

3 gallons × 1/4 = 0.75 gallons

Now, we can convert 0.75 gallons to pints by multiplying 0.75 by 8:

0.75 gallons × 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline to run her lawnmower.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of candy bars George bought as x. The total amount of money George spent on chips is $1.20, and the amount of money he spent on candy bars is $3.79. Since each candy bar costs $0.75, we can set up the equation:

1.20 + 0.75x = 4.99

To solve for x, we can subtract 1.20 from both sides of the equation:

0.75x = 4.99 - 1.20
0.75x = 3.79

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.75 to isolate x:

x = 3.79 / 0.75
x = 5.0533

Since we cannot buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we can employ basic division. 

First, we need to calculate the number of lollipops Ray shared with his friends. This can be found by subtracting the number of lollipops he kept from the total number of lollipops he initially had: 25 - 5 = 20.

Next, we divide the number of lollipops shared by the number of friends: 20 ÷ 4 = 5.

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we can employ a straightforward approach by first calculating the weight of each piece and then subtracting the total weight consumed by Rory and her mom.

Given that the cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 equal pieces, we can calculate the weight of each piece as follows:

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Since Rory and her mom each consume one piece, the total weight of the cake they eat is:

Total weight eaten = 2 * Weight of each piece
Total weight eaten = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

Now, we can calculate the weight of the remaining cake by subtracting the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake:

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

Therefore, the weight of the remaining cake is 15 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of oranges each person will receive, we need to calculate the total number of oranges and then divide it by the total number of people sharing them.

First, let's find the total number of oranges. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. The total number of oranges is the sum of their individual quantities:

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Now, we need to determine the total number of people sharing the oranges. Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends make up a total of 8 people.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

Total oranges ÷ Total people = 56 ÷ 8 = 7

Therefore, each person will receive 7 oranges.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we must first calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

The cost of onions is a function of the quantity and unit price. Antoine requires 2 pounds of onions, but he wants to double the amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. Given that the onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Similarly, the cost of beef stock is a function of the quantity and unit price. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00. Therefore, the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of onions and beef stock, which is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, we can calculate the cost per serving by dividing the total cost of the ingredients by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

Therefore, the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup is $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne to arrive at the premiere first, we need to consider the time it takes for each of them to get to the theater.

Let's denote the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater as $t_W$. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, we have $t_W = 4$ minutes.

Given that Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, we can express the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater as $t_B = 4t_W$. Substituting the value of $t_W$, we get $t_B = 4 \times 4 = 16$ minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we need to find the time difference between their arrival times. Let's denote the time Bernadette leaves as $t_L$. Then, the time Bernadette arrives at the theater is $t_B + t_L$, and the time Wayne arrives is $t_W + t_L$.

We want Bernadette to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so we can set up the equation:

$$t_B + t_L = (t_W + t_L) - 5$$

Substituting the values of $t_B$ and $t_W$, we get:

$$16 + t_L = 4 + t_L - 5$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$16 = -1 + t_L$$

Solving for $t_L$, we get:

$$t_L = 17$$

This means Bernadette needs to leave 17 minutes before Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"Given that the area of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 360 square feet and the length of his room is 3 yards, we can first convert the length to feet, as 1 yard is equivalent to 3 feet. Therefore, the length in feet is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Using the formula for the area of a rectangle, A = lw, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width, we can solve for the width:

A = lw
360 = 9w
w = 360 / 9
w = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width:

P = 2(l + w)
P = 2(9 + 40)
P = 2(49)
P = 98 feet

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we can calculate the total number of beads each has. 

Let's denote the number of beads Elizabeth has as E and the number of beads Margareth has as M. Since each pack of beads contains 20 pieces, we can express the total number of beads each sister has as follows:

E = (1 pack of red beads) + (2 packs of clear beads)
E = 1 × 20 + 2 × 20
E = 20 + 40
E = 60

M = (3 packs of blue beads) + (4 packs of red beads)
M = 3 × 20 + 4 × 20
M = 60 + 80
M = 140

Now, we can find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
ΔM = M - E
ΔM = 140 - 60
ΔM = 80

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to consider the effects of the oven and the open window on the temperature.

The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Since Marcus bakes for 3 hours, the total temperature increase due to the oven is given by the product of the rate of increase and the duration:

ΔT_oven = 5°/h × 3 h = 15°

The window causes the house to cool down at a rate of 2° for every 10 minutes. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours, the temperature decrease due to the window is:

ΔT_window = (2°/10 min) × (0.5 h × 60 min/h) = 6°

The initial temperature of the house is 40°. Therefore, the final temperature is the sum of the initial temperature and the temperature changes due to the oven and the window:

T_final = T_initial + ΔT_oven - ΔT_window
= 40° + 15° - 6°
= 49°

The final answer is: 49"
"To determine the time it took James to complete the run, we must first calculate his total time for the triathlon. Given that Jon's total time is 170 minutes and he won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Next, we need to find James' times for the swim and bike. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, his swim time is 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes. Additionally, James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so his bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we can calculate James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time: 180 - (36 + 85) = 180 - 121 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{59}$"
"To determine the length of Movie A, we can start by converting the length of Movie C to minutes, as it is given in hours. We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equivalent to 1.25 × 60 = 75 minutes.

Next, we are informed that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B can be calculated as follows:

Movie B = Length of Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B = 80 minutes

Now, we are told that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we can divide the length of Movie B by 4:

Movie A = Length of Movie B ÷ 4
Movie A = 80 minutes ÷ 4
Movie A = 20 minutes

Therefore, the length of Movie A is 20 minutes."
"To determine the amount of change Michael has after purchasing hay for his horse, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs. Given that the horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is equivalent to 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Using the formula Distance = Speed * Time, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse consumes 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay consumed is:

Hay consumed = 16 miles * (1/2 bail/mile) = 8 bails.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is:

Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which amounts to a total of:

Initial amount = 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the total cost of hay from the initial amount of money:

Change = Initial amount - Total cost = $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs available. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the 4 dozen eggs can be calculated as 4 × 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, we have a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Given that each glass requires 5 eggs, the total number of glasses Rozanne can make is 50 ÷ 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the total number of trays Rozanne can put out is 10 ÷ 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the difference in points between Joey and Marcy after their respective turns in Scrabble, we need to calculate their updated scores.

Joey's initial score is 214 points. He scores 26 points during his turn, so his new score is:

214 + 26 = 240

Marcy's initial score is 225 points. She scores 10 points during her turn, so her new score is:

225 + 10 = 235

To find the difference in their scores, we subtract Marcy's new score from Joey's new score:

240 - 235 = 5

Therefore, Joey is winning by 5 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is given by the product of the number of sneakers sold and the price per sneaker:

$$\text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340$$

Next, we calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store. There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and they were sold for $25 each. The revenue from the department store sale is given by the product of the number of sneakers sold and the price per sneaker:

$$\text{Revenue from department store sale} = 31 \times 25 = 775$$

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale:

$$\text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115$$

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:

$$\text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539$$

The final answer is: $539"
"To determine the total number of crayons Beatrice purchased, we can calculate the number of crayons in the two distinct categories of packets.

First, we calculate the number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each. This can be represented as 6 × 8 = 48.

Next, we calculate the number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each. This can be represented as 4 × 16 = 64.

To find the total number of crayons, we add the number of crayons in both categories: 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, Beatrice purchased a total of 112 crayons for her Art class.

The final answer is: 112"
"To determine the regular price of popcorn, let's analyze the given information. We have two scenarios:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra.
2. The regular price of a soda is $3.
3. If you buy a regular ticket and don't buy the super ticket, you save $2.

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as $p. The cost of the super ticket can be expressed as $20 = $12 (regular ticket) + $p (popcorn) + $1 (extra for popcorn and soda) + $3 (soda). Simplifying this equation, we get:

$20 = $12 + $p + $1 + $3
$20 = $16 + $p
$p = $4

However, this is not the correct answer. The correct answer can be obtained by considering the savings. If you buy a regular ticket and don't buy the super ticket, you save $2. The cost of the regular ticket and a soda is $12 + $3 = $15. The cost of the super ticket is $20. The difference between the two scenarios is $20 - $15 = $5. This $5 difference is the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket. Since the super ticket includes the popcorn for $1 extra, the regular price of the popcorn is $5 - $1 = $4.

However, this is still not the correct answer. Let's re-evaluate the situation. The cost of the super ticket is $20, and the regular ticket costs $12. The extra $8 ($20 - $12) is for the popcorn and the soda. Since the soda costs $3, the cost of the popcorn is $8 - $3 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the original cost of filling one balloon. Let's denote the original cost as x. The total cost of filling 20 balloons is $900, so we can set up the equation 20x = 900.

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: x = 900 / 20 = 45.

This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45. Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65.

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. We can calculate this by multiplying the new cost of filling one balloon by 170: 65 \* 170 = 11050.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11050}$"
"To determine the average speed of the car during the trip, we can utilize the formula for average speed, which is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

Given that the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours and 30 mph for 1 hour, we can calculate the distance traveled during each segment of the trip.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance1 = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles
Distance2 = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances traveled during each segment, which is 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.

The total time taken is the sum of the times spent traveling at each speed, which is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

Therefore, the average speed of the car during the trip is 50 mph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Let's denote the initial number of sapphires as S = 8 and the initial number of rubies as R = 0. Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so the new number of sapphires is S' = S - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5, and the new number of rubies is R' = R + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2.

The value of a sapphire is given as $800, and the value of a ruby is given as $1200. Therefore, the total value of the sapphires Jenna has left is 5 * $800 = $4000, and the total value of the rubies she received is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is the sum of the value of the sapphires and the rubies, which is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To determine the total number of apples Marin and Nancy consume in 30 days, we can apply basic arithmetic principles. Given that each individual consumes 4 apples per day, the combined daily consumption is 4 + 4 = 8 apples.

To find the total consumption over a 30-day period, we can multiply the daily consumption by the number of days:

8 apples/day × 30 days = 240 apples

This calculation is a straightforward application of the distributive property of multiplication over addition, where the product of a sum is equal to the sum of the products. In this case, the product of 8 apples/day and 30 days is equivalent to the sum of 8 apples/day multiplied by each day individually.

The final answer is: 240"
"To determine the cost of potting soil for Bob's vegetable garden, we must first calculate the total volume of soil required. Given that each raised bed is a rectangular prism with dimensions 2 feet in width, 8 feet in length, and 2 feet in height, we can calculate the volume of one bed as follows:

Volume = length × width × height = 8 ft × 2 ft × 2 ft = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

Total Volume = 32 cubic feet/bed × 10 beds = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags required is:

Number of Bags = Total Volume / Volume per Bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags

Given that each bag costs $12, the total cost of potting soil is:

Total Cost = Number of Bags × Cost per Bag = 160 bags × $12/bag = $1920

The final answer is: $1920"
"To determine the total number of cards, we first need to calculate the number of green cards. Given that there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can express this relationship as:

Number of green cards = 1.6 × Number of red cards

Since there are 15 red cards, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Number of green cards = 1.6 × 15
= 1.6 × 15
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

The total number of cards is the sum of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of fairies remaining, we can break down the sequence of events.

Initially, Katelyn observed 50 fairies. 

Twenty minutes later, her friend witnessed half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the existing group. This implies that 25 fairies joined the initial 50, resulting in a total of 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. To find the number of fairies remaining, we subtract the number of fairies that departed from the total: 75 - 30 = 45.

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is 45.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To determine the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to calculate the total number of puppies and the number of puppies with spots.

Let's denote the total number of puppies as $T$ and the number of puppies with spots as $S$. We are given that Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

We can express the total number of puppies as the sum of the number of puppies from Jennifer's dog and the number of puppies from Brandon's dog:

$$T = 8 + 12 = 20$$

Similarly, we can express the total number of puppies with spots as the sum of the number of puppies with spots from Jennifer's dog and the number of puppies with spots from Brandon's dog:

$$S = 3 + 4 = 7$$

Now, we can calculate the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100:

$$\text{Percentage of puppies with spots} = \frac{S}{T} \times 100 = \frac{7}{20} \times 100 = 35\%$$

Therefore, the percentage of puppies with spots is 35%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make to transport the feed, we must first calculate the total weight of the feed. This can be done by summing the weights of each type of feed.

The weight of the sugar cubes is 2 pounds, as the farmer purchases two 1-pound boxes. The weight of the carrots is 48 pounds, as four 12-pound bags are purchased. The weight of the hay is 3150 pounds, as 42 bales of 75 pounds each are bought. Lastly, the weight of the oats is 1300 pounds, as 20 sacks of 65 pounds each are purchased.

The total weight of the feed is therefore 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

To find the number of trips required, we divide the total weight of the feed by the capacity of the farm truck, which is 2250 pounds.

$$\frac{3400}{2250} = 1.511$$

Since we cannot make a fraction of a trip, we must round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the farmer needs to make $\boxed{2}$ trips to transport all the feed."
"To determine Grayson's monthly earnings from recycling, we need to calculate the total value of the aluminum cans and plastic bottles she recycles in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles. 

The value of aluminum cans per week is given by the product of the number of cans consumed and the value per can: 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week.

Similarly, the value of plastic bottles per week is given by the product of the number of bottles consumed and the value per bottle: 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

The total weekly earnings from recycling is the sum of the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the total monthly earnings by multiplying the weekly earnings by 4: 21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the number of plants Shondra has, we need to establish the relationship between the number of plants each individual possesses. Given that Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has by considering that she has 60% more plants than Frederick.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (0.6 * Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has by subtracting 7 from Toni's total:
Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the amount Ali has now, we need to calculate the amount Leila gave him and add it to the amount he already had.

Leila gave Ali half of her $100, which can be calculated as follows:

$$\frac{100}{2} = 50$$

Therefore, Leila gave Ali $50.

Ali already had $21. 

So, the total amount Ali has now is $21 + $50 = $71.

The final answer is: $71"
"To determine the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to calculate the tip as a percentage of the cost of the pizza. Since the tip is equal to 1/5 of the cost of the pizza, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 1 by 5, which equals 0.2. 

Tip = 0.2 * $15
Tip = $3

The total amount Ashley should give the delivery man is the sum of the cost of the pizza and the tip.

Total amount = Cost of the pizza + Tip
Total amount = $15 + $3
Total amount = $18

"To determine the number of students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she possesses. 

Let's begin by calculating the total number of basketball cards. Since she has 6 decks with 25 cards in each deck, the total number of basketball cards is given by the product of the number of decks and the number of cards per deck: $6 \times 25 = 150$.

Next, we calculate the total number of baseball cards. With 5 boxes containing 40 cards in each box, the total number of baseball cards is the product of the number of boxes and the number of cards per box: $5 \times 40 = 200$.

The total number of cards is the sum of the basketball and baseball cards: $150 + 200 = 350$.

Since Miss Maria retains 50 cards, the number of cards she distributes to her students is $350 - 50 = 300$.

Given that each student receives 10 cards, the number of students can be found by dividing the total number of distributed cards by the number of cards per student: $\frac{300}{10} = 30$.

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the difference in the amount paid by Kelly and Becky, we first need to calculate the total cost of the apples for each individual.

Becky purchased 20 apples at a cost of $0.45 per apple. The total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Number of apples × Cost per apple
Total cost = 20 × $0.45
Total cost = $9.00

Becky received a $1 discount, which is equivalent to $0.10 (since $1 = $0.10). Therefore, the amount Becky paid is:

Amount paid by Becky = Total cost - Discount
Amount paid by Becky = $9.00 - $0.10
Amount paid by Becky = $8.90

Kelly purchased 20 apples at a cost of $0.50 per apple. The total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Number of apples × Cost per apple
Total cost = 20 × $0.50
Total cost = $10.00

Kelly received a 10% discount on the total cost. To calculate the discount amount, we can multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (10% = 0.10):

Discount = Total cost × Discount percentage
Discount = $10.00 × 0.10
Discount = $1.00

The amount Kelly paid is:

Amount paid by Kelly = Total cost - Discount
Amount paid by Kelly = $10.00 - $1.00
Amount paid by Kelly = $9.00

To find the difference in the amount paid by Kelly and Becky, we subtract the amount paid by Becky from the amount paid by Kelly:

Difference = Amount paid by Kelly - Amount paid by Becky
Difference = $9.00 - $8.90
Difference = $0.10

The final answer is: $0.10"
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply it by the total number of rooms.

Let's denote the number of sheets as S, the number of comforters as C, the number of pillow cases as P, and the number of towels as T. We are given that:

- S = 2 (since each room has two sheets)
- C = 1 (since each room has one comforter)
- P = 2S (twice as many pillow cases as sheets)
- T = 2P (twice as many towels as pillow cases)

Substituting the value of S into the equation for P, we get P = 2(2) = 4. Then, substituting the value of P into the equation for T, we get T = 2(4) = 8.

Now, we can calculate the total number of items per room by adding the number of sheets, comforters, pillow cases, and towels: S + C + P + T = 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15.

To find the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we multiply the total number of items per room by the total number of rooms: 15 * 80 = 1200.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1200}$"
"To determine the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has on Sunday, we need to calculate the cumulative number of shoes he acquires and then subtract the shoes he discards on Saturday.

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes.

On Monday, he acquires 5 pairs of shoes, which is equivalent to 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes, which amounts to 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.

On Friday, he acquires 30 new pairs of shoes, resulting in 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

The cumulative number of shoes he has after gaining new pairs is 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he discards 180 shoes.

Therefore, the total number of shoes he has on Sunday is 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

The final numerical answer is: 120"
"To determine the number of pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles she has. Given that each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, we can calculate the total number of cupcakes as follows:

Total cupcakes = Number of jars × Cupcakes per jar
Total cupcakes = 6 × 8
Total cupcakes = 48

Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we can determine the number of pans needed by dividing the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per pan:

Number of pans = Total cupcakes ÷ Cupcakes per pan
Number of pans = 48 ÷ 12
Number of pans = 4

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles."
"To determine the amount of change Theo received, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased and subtract that from the amount she paid.

The cost of the pen is $2. The cost of the paper is $1 less than three times the price of the pen, which can be expressed as 3p - 1, where p is the price of the pen. Substituting the value of p, we get 3(2) - 1 = 6 - 1 = $5.

The total cost of the items is the sum of the cost of the pen and the paper, which is $2 + $5 = $7.

Since Theo gave the cashier $10, the change she received is $10 - $7 = $3.

Therefore, the amount of change Theo received is $3."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. 

First, we need to determine the total number of pencils initially in the class. Since there are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils, we can calculate the total number of pencils as follows:

Total pencils initially = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

Next, we need to find the number of pencils used after two months. It is given that 1/5 of the total pencils were used. We can express this as a fraction of the total pencils:

Pencils used = (1/5) * 300 = 60 pencils

Now, we can find the remaining pencils after two months by subtracting the pencils used from the total pencils:

Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. We can calculate this as follows:

Pencils left = (1/3) * 240 = 80 pencils

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt must eat 6 carrot sticks to have the opportunity to eat 5 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras, we first need to calculate the combined length of the remoras. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' length from inches to feet.

Given that 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches, we can convert 6 inches to feet as follows:

6 inches = 6/12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are two remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:

2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras:

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras occupies 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of students at a particular grade level, we can utilize the information provided about the proportion of students without desktop computers. Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students fall into the latter category.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

(1/4)x = 20

where x is the total number of students. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate x:

x = 20 * 4

x = 80

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80."
"To determine how many days Jason has to walk in order to break in his new shoes, we need to calculate the total number of days he has available in three weeks and then divide that by the number of days he can walk per week.

First, let's calculate the total number of days Jason has available in three weeks:

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, we need to divide the total number of days by 4 to find out how many days he has to walk:

21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4

"To determine the number of books each child received, we can employ basic algebraic principles. Let's denote the number of books each child received as 'x'. Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, the total number of books she bought can be represented as 4x.

Given that the total amount spent on books is $300 and the cost of each book is $15, we can set up the equation:

4x = 300 / 15

To solve for x, we can simplify the right-hand side of the equation by performing the division:

4x = 20

Next, we can isolate x by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 20 / 4

x = 5

Therefore, each child received 5 books.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of kids in Gina's class who aren't allergic to anything, we can utilize the principle of inclusion-exclusion from set theory. This principle allows us to calculate the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts by adding the number of kids allergic to each, then subtracting the number allergic to both to avoid double-counting.

Let's denote the total number of kids in the class as $n = 32$, the number of kids allergic to dairy as $D = 9$, the number of kids allergic to peanuts as $P = 6$, and the number of kids allergic to both as $D \cap P = 3$.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts is given by:

$|D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12$

Now, to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class:

$n - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20$

Therefore, the number of kids in Gina's class who aren't allergic to anything is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and add the number of tour guides.

First, we calculate the total number of employees by multiplying the number of groups by the number of employees per group: 3 groups * 200 employees/group = 600 employees.

Next, we calculate the total number of tour guides by multiplying the number of groups by the number of tour guides per group: 3 groups * 7 tour guides/group = 21 tour guides.

Finally, we add the total number of employees and tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour: 600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621 people.

The total number of people going on the tour is 621.

The final answer is: $\boxed{621}$"
"To determine the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel separately and then sum them.

The cost of the plane tickets is straightforward, as it is a fixed amount of $5000 per person. Since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 \* $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel cost, however, is a bit more complex. We are given that the normal price is $1500 per day, but it is 20% more expensive due to a busy weekend. To find the new price, we can use the formula for percentage increase:

New price = Normal price + (Normal price \* Percentage increase)

In this case, the percentage increase is 20%, which can be expressed as 0.20 in decimal form. Therefore, the new price is:

New price = $1500 + ($1500 \* 0.20)
= $1500 + $300
= $1800 per day

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is:

Total hotel cost = New price per day \* Number of days
= $1800 \* 3
= $5400

Now, we can find the total cost of the trip by adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel:

Total cost = Cost of plane tickets + Total hotel cost
= $10,000 + $5400
= $16,400

The final answer is: $16,400"
"To determine the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he possesses.

Let's denote the number of tubes of blue paint Ben has as B. Given that Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, we can express this as J = B/2, where J represents the number of tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Since Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, we can substitute B = 4 into the equation to find J = 4/2 = 2.

Next, we need to calculate the number of tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. It is given that Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. Let's denote the number of tubes of yellow paint Ben has as Y. We can express this as J = 3Y, where J represents the number of tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. Since Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, we can substitute Y = 3 into the equation to find J = 3 * 3 = 9.

However, we need to note that the variable J is being used to represent both the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint Jasper has. To avoid confusion, let's denote the number of tubes of yellow paint Jasper has as Y'. We can then express Y' = 3Y, where Y' represents the number of tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. Since Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, we can substitute Y = 3 into the equation to find Y' = 3 * 3 = 9.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to add the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he possesses. This can be expressed as J + Y' = 2 + 9 = 11.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to establish the weight of the 2010 penny. Given that it is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can express this relationship as a mathematical equation.

Let's denote the weight of the 1959 penny as $w_{1959}$ and the weight of the 2010 penny as $w_{2010}$. We are given that $w_{1959} = 48$ grains. The relationship between the two weights can be expressed as:

$$w_{2010} = \frac{3}{4}w_{1959}$$

Substituting the given value for $w_{1959}$, we get:

$$w_{2010} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36$$

Therefore, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weights of the 1959 and 2010 pennies:

$$w_{\text{combined}} = w_{1959} + w_{2010} = 48 + 36 = 84$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the remaining amount needed to reach their goal, we can calculate the difference between the target amount and the total amount earned by Keegan and Tasha.

Let's denote the target amount as $200 and the total amount earned as $83 (Keegan) + $91 (Tasha) = $174.

The remaining amount needed can be calculated as follows:

Remaining amount = Target amount - Total amount earned
= $200 - $174
= $26

Therefore, Keegan and Tasha need to earn an additional $26 to reach their goal.

The final answer is: $26"
"To determine the difference in the number of songs Luri and Gabriel can add to their respective portable media players, we first need to calculate the number of songs each can add. 

Let's denote the capacity of the portable media player as C = 100 songs. Gabriel currently has 20 songs on his player, so the number of songs he can add is C - 20 = 100 - 20 = 80.

Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so the number of songs Luri has is 3 * 20 = 60. Therefore, the number of songs Luri can add is C - 60 = 100 - 60 = 40.

The difference in the number of songs Gabriel and Luri can add is 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to calculate the number of oranges he consumed and then multiply it by the amount he lost per orange.

Given that Stetson ate 2/5 of the total oranges picked, we can express this as a fraction of the total number of oranges, which is 60. 

Let's calculate the number of oranges Stetson ate:
(2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 oranges.

Now, we know that Stetson lost $10 for each orange he ate. Therefore, we can calculate the total amount of money he lost by multiplying the number of oranges he ate by the amount he lost per orange:
24 oranges * $10/orange = $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"Given that Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes, we can express this relationship as an algebraic equation. Let's denote the cost of her shoes as S and the cost of her handbag as B.

We are given that S = $80. To find the cost of the handbag, we need to calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes and then subtract $20.

3S = 3(80) = 240

Now, we can express the cost of the handbag as B = 3S - 20. Substituting the value of S, we get:

B = 3(80) - 20
B = 240 - 20
B = 220

Therefore, Jillian's handbag cost $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total hours James runs in a week, we first need to calculate the total distance he covers in a week. Given that he runs 12 miles per day for 5 days a week, we can calculate this as follows:

Total miles run in a week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
= 60 miles/week

Now, we can use James' running speed to find the total hours he runs in a week. His speed is 10 miles per hour, so we can calculate the total hours as follows:

Hours run in a week = Total miles run in a week / Speed
= 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
= 6 hours/week

Therefore, James runs 6 hours a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we must first calculate the total amount of oats consumed by his horses in a day. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, resulting in a daily consumption of 5 * 2 = 10 pounds per horse.

Given that Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds. To find the total consumption for five days, we multiply this value by 5, yielding 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we can calculate the number of bags needed by dividing the total consumption by the weight of a single bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of girl Pomeranians, we can break down the problem into manageable steps. First, we need to find the total number of Pomeranians, which is two thirds of Jana's 27 puppies. This can be calculated using the following proportion:

Pomeranians = (2/3) × 27
Pomeranians = 18

Next, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians, which is one third of the total Pomeranians. This can be calculated as follows:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) × 18
Girl Pomeranians = 6

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To calculate the average highest temperature of the three countries, we need to first find the sum of their highest recorded temperatures and then divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48°F, in Northlandia is 21°F, and in Midlandia is -3°F.

We can calculate the sum of these temperatures as follows:

-48 + 21 - 3 = -30

Now, we divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3:

-30 / 3 = -10

Therefore, the average highest temperature of the three countries is -10°F."
"To determine the number of days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the remaining amount first. The child already has $4 in savings and needs to save $12 for the toy car. 

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we can use the formula for simple interest to find the number of days it will take to save the remaining amount, where the daily savings is the interest rate (r) and the remaining amount is the principal (P). However, in this case, we are dealing with a fixed amount saved daily, so we can use the formula:

Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Number of days = $8 / $2
Number of days = 4

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of eggs that Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to calculate the total capacity of the trays and subtract that from the total number of eggs he has.

Given that each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, the total capacity of the trays is:
24 eggs/tray * 2 trays = 48 eggs

Jaime has 64 eggs, and the trays can hold 48 eggs, so the number of eggs that won't fit is:
64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

Therefore, the number of eggs that Jaime won't be able to place on the tray is 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total amount Sally spent on pizzas, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs three times as much as the small pizza, we can express this relationship as a mathematical equation:

Let x be the cost of the small pizza. Then, the cost of the family-size pizza is 3x.

Given that the cost of the small pizza is $8, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Cost of family-size pizza = 3x
Cost of family-size pizza = 3($8)
Cost of family-size pizza = $24

Now, we can find the total amount spent by adding the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza:

Total amount spent = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza
Total amount spent = $8 + $24
Total amount spent = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To determine the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to consider the sale and the coupon. The razors are buy one get one free, which means Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors at the discounted price. The original price of a pack is $4.00, but with the sale, she will only pay $4.00 / 2 = $2.00 for 2 packs.

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, which she can apply to the discounted price. The total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon is $2.00 - $2.00 = $0.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors. To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors: $0.00 / 8 = $0.00.

However, since we cannot divide by zero, we need to reconsider the calculation. The correct approach is to calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale, which is $2.00. Then, we can calculate the cost of each individual razor by dividing the cost of 2 packs by the number of razors in 2 packs: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

"To determine the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up. 

Let's start by calculating the height of each level. The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 

536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

Therefore, the total height of the human pyramid is 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44.67}$"
"To determine the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we can calculate the total number of minutes she walked in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma walks 5 minutes every hour. Since she works 8 hours a day, we can calculate the total number of minutes she walked in a day as follows:

Total minutes walked per day = 5 minutes/hour * 8 hours/day = 5 * 8 = 40 minutes/day

Since she worked for 5 days, we can calculate the total number of minutes she walked as follows:

Total minutes walked = Total minutes walked per day * Number of days worked
= 40 minutes/day * 5 days
= 40 * 5
= 200 minutes

Therefore, Charisma walked a total of 200 minutes after 5 days at the office.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic reasoning. Let's denote Angela's current age as A. Since Brett is 14 years old now, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. This can be expressed as:

A + 4 = 3 * 14

Simplifying the equation, we get:

A + 4 = 42

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation, we get:

A = 38

Therefore, Angela's current age is 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"To determine the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we can calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides can be calculated as follows:

Morning rides cost = Number of days × Cost per ride
= 14 days × $6 per day
= 14 × 6
= $84

The cost of the afternoon rides can be calculated as follows:

Afternoon rides cost = Number of days × Cost per ride
= 14 days × $2 per day
= 14 × 2
= $28

The total cost is the sum of the morning and afternoon rides costs:

Total cost = Morning rides cost + Afternoon rides cost
= $84 + $28
= $112

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is $112."
"To determine the number of Greek orange pies that Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have and then divide that by the number of oranges required for one pie.

Let's start by calculating the number of oranges Ashley brought. Since she has 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, we can express this as 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Next, we need to calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought. It is given that she brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so we can express this as 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

Now, we can find the total number of oranges they have by adding the number of oranges Ashley and Brianne brought: 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie requires 3 oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges required for one pie: 120 / 3 = 40 pies.

Therefore, Brianne and Ashley can make 40 Greek orange pies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

The cost of the first venue is a flat fee of $200 plus an additional $5 per guest for food, so the total cost is $200 + $5x.

The cost of the second venue is a per-person charge of $25, which includes the cost of food.

To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides of the equation yields:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides of the equation by 20 gives us:

x = 10

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B, the number of insects David found as D, and the number of insects Lily found as L.

We are given that Lily found 7 more insects than David, so we can write the equation L = D + 7.

We are also given that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write the equation D = B/2.

Lastly, we know that together they collected 43 insects, so we can write the equation L + D + B = 43.

Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now, substitute D = B/2 into the equation: 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B = 36.

Combine like terms: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we need to calculate the yards used by each of them separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the yards used by Mariah. Since she used 1/4 of a skein, we can express this as a fraction of the total yards in a skein, which is 364 yards. Therefore, the yards used by Mariah can be calculated as follows:

$$\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91$$

Next, let's calculate the yards used by her grandma. Since she used 1/2 of a skein, we can express this as a fraction of the total yards in a skein, which is 364 yards. Therefore, the yards used by her grandma can be calculated as follows:

$$\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182$$

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together to find the total yards used:

$$91 + 182 = 273$$

Therefore, the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma is 273 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{273}$"
"To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of gifts for her friends and then adding the 10 random gifts.

First, let's calculate the number of gifts for the friends who want 5 gifts each. This can be represented as 2 * 5 = 10 gifts.

Next, we calculate the number of gifts for the friends who want 2 gifts each. This can be represented as 3 * 2 = 6 gifts.

Now, we can find the total number of gifts for all friends by adding the gifts for the two groups: 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Finally, we add the 10 random gifts to the total number of gifts for her friends: 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.

Therefore, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"Given the problem, we can approach it by first determining the width of the rug, as it is directly related to the dimensions of the chair. The chair's width is provided as 3 feet, and we are informed that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Therefore, the rug's width can be calculated as follows:

rug_width = chair_width + 5
rug_width = 3 + 5
rug_width = 8 feet

Next, we need to find the length of the couch, which is stated to be 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. We can express this relationship as:

couch_length = 2 * rug_width + 2
couch_length = 2 * 8 + 2
couch_length = 16 + 2
couch_length = 18 feet

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x.

The total cost of the grape gum is $2, and the total cost of the green apple gum is $1. So, the total cost of all the gum is 2x + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2x.

We are given that the total cost is $7. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x = 7.

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, 2x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2, x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the optimal lumber purchase for Frederick's popsicle stick production, we need to calculate the cost-effectiveness of each type of wood. 

Let's denote the number of 2 x 4 pieces of wood as x and the number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood as y. The total cost of the lumber can be expressed as 4x + 6y = 24, since each 2 x 4 costs $4 and each 2 x 8 costs $6.

We also know that the total number of popsicle sticks is given by 200x + 400y.

To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, we need to find the optimal values of x and y that satisfy the cost constraint and give the maximum number of sticks.

First, let's solve the cost constraint equation for x: 4x = 24 - 6y, which simplifies to x = 6 - 1.5y.

Now, substitute this expression for x into the equation for the total number of popsicle sticks: 200(6 - 1.5y) + 400y.

Simplifying this expression, we get 1200 - 300y + 400y = 1200 + 100y.

To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, we need to find the maximum value of y that satisfies the cost constraint. Since y must be an integer (we can't buy a fraction of a piece of wood), we can try different values of y to find the maximum.

Let's try y = 4: 4 * 6 = 24, which satisfies the cost constraint.

Now, substitute y = 4 into the expression for the total number of popsicle sticks: 1200 + 100(4) = 1200 + 400 = 1600.

Therefore, the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1600}$"
"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's sled dogs, we must first calculate the total number of snowshoes required. Given that each dog has four legs and Mario has six dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00, so the total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To determine the amount Janet would save by purchasing a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips in a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass from this amount.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. Therefore, the total number of bus trips she takes in a week is 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week.

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20. To find the total weekly cost of bus trips, we multiply the cost of one trip by the total number of trips in a week:

Total weekly cost of bus trips = 2.20 trips/ride * 10 rides/week = $22.00/week

Now, we can calculate the amount Janet would save by purchasing a weekly bus pass for $20:

Amount saved = Total weekly cost of bus trips - Cost of weekly bus pass
= $22.00/week - $20/week
= $2.00/week

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Given the information provided, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of cows and sheep at the farm and the zoo.

Let F represent the number of cows at the farm, S represent the number of sheep at the farm, Z_c represent the number of cows at the zoo, and Z_s represent the number of sheep at the zoo.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. F = 30 (the farm has 30 cows)
2. Z_c = 2F (the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm)
3. Z_s = 2S (the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo)
4. Z_s = 20 (the zoo has 20 sheep)

Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get Z_c = 2(30) = 60.

Substituting equation (1) into equation (3), we get S = (1/2)F = (1/2)(30) = 15.

Now, we can substitute the value of S into equation (4) to verify the number of sheep at the zoo: Z_s = 2S = 2(15) = 30. However, we are given that Z_s = 20, which indicates an inconsistency in the problem statement.

Assuming the problem statement is correct, we can proceed with the given information. The total number of animals at the farm is F + S = 30 + 15 = 45. The total number of animals at the zoo is Z_c + Z_s = 60 + 20 = 80.

The total number of animals at both the farm and the zoo is 45 + 80 = 125.

The final answer is: 125"
"Let's analyze the problem. We are given that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. If Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'.

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can write the equation as:
x + y = 4(x + y)

However, this equation is not necessary to solve the problem. We can directly use the information that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, so we can write the equation as:
12 = 4x
4 = 4y

Simplifying the equations:
x = 3
y = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit required for Andy to reach his weight loss goal, we first need to calculate the total number of days he has to achieve this goal. Given that his birthday is on July 19th and today is December 31st, we can calculate the number of days as follows:

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day.
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days.
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days.
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days.
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days.
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days.
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days:

$$\frac{105,000}{171} \approx 613.5$$

Therefore, Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of approximately 613.5 calories to reach his weight loss goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{614}$"
"To determine Gerald's remaining funds after a week of work, we must first calculate his total earnings and then subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald's daily earnings are $30. Since there are 7 days in a standard week, we can calculate his total earnings as follows:

$$
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Daily Earnings} \times \text{Number of Days}
$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$
\text{Total Earnings} = \$30 \times 7 = \$210
$$

Now, to find out how much Gerald has left after spending $100, we subtract the amount spent from his total earnings:

$$
\text{Remaining Funds} = \text{Total Earnings} - \text{Amount Spent}
$$

Substituting the values, we get:

$$
\text{Remaining Funds} = \$210 - \$100 = \$110
$$

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left after a week of work."
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total distance she will run. Given that each lap is 0.25 km and she is required to run 8 laps, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

Total distance = Number of laps × Distance per lap
Total distance = 8 laps × 0.25 km/lap
Total distance = 2 km

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, given that she requires 60 ml of water per kilometer:

Total water consumption = Total distance × Water consumption per kilometer
Total water consumption = 2 km × 60 ml/km
Total water consumption = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 120 ml of water after running 8 laps."
"To determine the amount of money Julie had left after her purchases, we can apply the concept of percentage reduction. Initially, Julie had $500.

First, she spent 20% of her initial amount on clothes. This can be calculated as follows:

20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

The remaining amount after purchasing clothes is:

$500 - $100 = $400

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining amount on CDs. This can be calculated as follows:

25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

The remaining amount after purchasing CDs is:

$400 - $100 = $300

Therefore, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combining like terms, we get 4x = 120,000.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000.

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can calculate the cost of the house as 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To determine the profit earned by Tara on her canvas bags, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Tara purchased 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. The total number of bags can be found by multiplying the number of packs by the number of bags per pack: 8 packs * 5 bags/pack = 40 bags. The total cost is then calculated by multiplying the total number of bags by the cost per bag: 40 bags * $4/bag = $160.

Next, we calculate the total revenue. Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue is 40 bags * $8/bag = $320.

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: profit = total revenue - total cost = $320 - $160 = $160.

Therefore, the profit earned by Tara on her canvas bags is $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To determine the total number of punches Joe threw during the fight, we need to calculate the total duration of the fight in minutes and then multiply it by his average punching rate.

The fight consists of 5 rounds, each lasting 3 minutes. Therefore, the total duration of the fight is 5 rounds * 3 minutes/round = 15 minutes.

Given that Joe throws 25 punches per minute, we can calculate the total number of punches he threw as follows:

Total punches = Punching rate * Total duration
Total punches = 25 punches/minute * 15 minutes
Total punches = 25 * 15
Total punches = 375

Therefore, Joe threw a total of 375 punches during the fight."
"To determine the number of cookies Kelsie made, we can establish a relationship between the number of cookies each person made. Let's denote the number of cookies Josh made as J, the number of cookies Suzanne made as S, and the number of cookies Kelsie made as K.

Given that Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can express Josh's cookies as a fraction of Suzanne's: J = S/4. Substituting S = 36, we get J = 36/4 = 9.

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. This relationship can be expressed as K = 2J. Substituting J = 9, we get K = 2(9) = 18.

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. The total money from the $10 bills is given by the product of the number of bills and the value of each bill, which is $10 \times 4 = $40. Similarly, the total money from the $20 bills is $20 \times 6 = $120. Therefore, the total money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Next, we need to find the amount of money Ali gives to his sister. Since he gives her half of the total money, we can calculate this as $160 \div 2 = $80. This means that Ali has $160 - $80 = $80 left after giving his sister half of the money.

Finally, we need to determine the amount of money Ali uses to buy dinner. He uses 3/5 of the remaining money, which is given by the expression $\frac{3}{5} \times 80$. To evaluate this expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 20 to get $\frac{3 \times 20}{5 \times 20} \times 80 = \frac{60}{100} \times 80 = 0.6 \times 80 = $48. Therefore, Ali has $80 - $48 = $32 left after buying dinner.

The final answer is: $32"
"To determine the time it takes Royce to shingle a house, we first need to convert Rob's time from hours to minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we can calculate this as follows:

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Now, we are given that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Royce's time = 2 * Rob's time + 40 minutes

Substituting Rob's time (120 minutes) into the equation, we get:

Royce's time = 2 * 120 + 40
             = 240 + 40
             = 280 minutes

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool needed, we can calculate the total for each item and then sum the results.

Let's denote the number of children as $n$, the number of skeins required for a hat as $h$, a scarf as $s$, a sweater as $w$, a pair of mittens as $m$, and a pair of socks as $k$. Given that Martha has triplets, $n = 3$. The number of skeins required for each item is as follows:

- Hats: $n \cdot h = 3 \cdot 2 = 6$ skeins

"To determine the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

Let's denote the total number of math problems as T = 100. On Monday, Chris completes 12 problems, leaving him with T - 12 = 88 problems.

On Tuesday, Chris completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems. Therefore, the total number of problems completed by Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48.

The number of problems remaining after Tuesday is T - 48 = 100 - 48 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems. Therefore, the total number of problems completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61.

The number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is T - 61 = 100 - 61 = 39.

The final answer is: $\boxed{39}$"
"To determine the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm, we need to calculate the individual rates at which each of them can pick strawberries and then sum these rates.

Let's denote the number of quarts Tony can pick per hour as T, the number of quarts Bobby can pick per hour as B, the number of quarts Kathy can pick per hour as K, and the number of quarts Ricky can pick per hour as R.

We are given that Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour, so T = 6.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so B = T - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so K = 2B = 2(5) = 10.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so R = K - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8.

Now, we can calculate the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour by summing their individual rates:

T + B + K + R = 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29

"To determine the number of loaves of bread left, we can apply basic principles of arithmetic operations. The bakery initially baked 200 loaves of bread. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon, resulting in a total of 132 loaves sold. Additionally, 6 loaves were returned by a grocery store.

We can calculate the number of loaves left by subtracting the total number of loaves sold and the number of loaves returned from the initial number of loaves baked.

Let's denote the initial number of loaves as $I$, the number of loaves sold as $S$, and the number of loaves returned as $R$. We can express the number of loaves left as:

Loaves left = $I - S - R$

Substituting the given values, we get:

Loaves left = 200 - 132 - 6
Loaves left = 62

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread left is 62."
"To determine the number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant, we need to calculate the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips separately and then sum them.

First, let's find the number of rows of red tulips. We can do this by dividing the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

Number of red tulips = 36
Number of tulips per row = 6
Number of rows of red tulips = 36 ÷ 6 = 6

Next, we'll find the number of rows of blue tulips by dividing the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of tulips per row = 8
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 ÷ 8 = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips.

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins required for each batch of cookies.

First, let's calculate the number of cups of raisins allocated to the granola and snack mix. Since Heather divides the bag of raisins equally among the three items, each of them will receive 27 cups / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Now, we can find the number of cups of raisins remaining for the oatmeal cookies by subtracting the amount allocated to the granola and snack mix from the total number of cups of raisins: 27 cups - 9 cups = 18 cups.

Next, we need to determine the number of batches of oatmeal cookies that can be made with the remaining raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 cup of raisins. To find the number of batches, we can divide the number of cups of raisins remaining by the amount required for each batch:

$$\frac{18\text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4}\text{ cup/batch}} = 18 \times \frac{4}{3} = 24$$

Therefore, Heather can make 24 batches of oatmeal cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to calculate her daily and weekly energy consumption, then multiply it by the cost per kilowatt hour.

First, let's calculate the daily and weekly energy consumption before adding the device. Given that Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour, her weekly consumption can be calculated as follows:

Weekly energy consumption (before) = Daily energy consumption × Number of days in a week
= 12 kW/h × 7 days
= 84 kW/h

Next, we need to calculate the daily and weekly energy consumption after adding the device. The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, so the total daily consumption becomes:

Daily energy consumption (after) = Daily energy consumption (before) + Energy consumption of the new device
= 12 kW/h + 2 kW/h
= 14 kW/h

The weekly energy consumption after adding the device is:

Weekly energy consumption (after) = Daily energy consumption (after) × Number of days in a week
= 14 kW/h × 7 days
= 98 kW/h

Now, we can calculate the cost of the energy consumption before and after adding the device. Given that the cost per kilowatt hour is $1.50, we can calculate the weekly cost as follows:

Weekly cost (before) = Weekly energy consumption (before) × Cost per kilowatt hour
= 84 kW/h × $1.50
= $126

Weekly cost (after) = Weekly energy consumption (after) × Cost per kilowatt hour
= 98 kW/h × $1.50
= $147

The difference in weekly electric bill is:

Difference = Weekly cost (after) - Weekly cost (before)
= $147 - $126
= $21

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we can utilize the concept of work rate and the principle of inverse proportionality between the number of workers and the time required to complete a task.

Let's denote the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house as $T_1$ and the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house as $T_5$. We are given that one person can paint half a house in 5 days, which implies that $T_1 = 5 \times 2 = 10$ days to paint a whole house.

The work rate of one person is inversely proportional to the time it takes to complete the task. Therefore, the work rate of 5 people is 5 times the work rate of one person. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$\frac{1}{T_5} = 5 \times \frac{1}{T_1}$$

Substituting the value of $T_1$, we get:

$$\frac{1}{T_5} = 5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{2}$$

Solving for $T_5$, we find:

$$T_5 = 2$$

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house in hours is:

$$T_5 \times 24 = 2 \times 24 = 48$$

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of sofas and chairs Ophelia and Jenna possess.

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as C and the number of sofas as S. We are given that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so we can express this relationship as:

S = C - 2

We are also given that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so we can express this relationship as:

Jenna's chairs = 3C

Since we know Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chairs she has:

20 = C - 2
C = 22

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has by multiplying the number of Ophelia's chairs by 3:

Jenna's chairs = 3C = 3(22) = 66

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can find the number of sofas she has by subtracting 2 from the number of chairs:

Jenna's sofas = 66 - 2 = 64

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs is 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: $\boxed{172}$"
"To determine the number of additional CDs Tom could have purchased if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we first need to calculate the cost of the headphone set.

Let's denote the cost of the CD as $4 and the total amount Tom spent as $48. The cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

Cost of headphone set = Total amount spent - Cost of CD
Cost of headphone set = $48 - $4
Cost of headphone set = $44

Now, we can calculate the number of CDs Tom could have purchased with the money he spent on the headphone set:

Number of CDs that could have been bought with headphone set money = Cost of headphone set / Cost of CD
Number of CDs that could have been bought with headphone set money = $44 / $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought with headphone set money = 11

Next, we calculate the total number of CDs Tom could have purchased with the money he spent on both the CD and the headphone set:

Total number of CDs = Total amount spent / Cost of CD
Total number of CDs = $48 / $4
Total number of CDs = 12

Finally, we can determine the number of additional CDs Tom could have purchased if he had decided not to buy the headphone set:

Number of additional CDs = Total number of CDs - Number of CDs that could have been bought with headphone set money
Number of additional CDs = 12 - 11
Number of additional CDs = 1

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to consider the varying hours he spent each week. 

Let's break down the information: Josh spent 4 hours working out every week except for two instances. In one instance, he spent 5 hours for two consecutive weeks, and in another instance, he spent 6 hours in a single week.

We can calculate the total hours spent in the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours. Since there are 6 weeks where he spent 4 hours, we can express this as 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

Next, we consider the weeks where he spent 5 hours. There are 2 weeks where he worked out for 5 hours, so we can express this as 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

Lastly, we need to account for the week where he spent 6 hours. This is a single instance, so we can express this as 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we add up the hours from each instance: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
\[ 48 - 8 = 40 \]

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is $5 \times 8 = 40$. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is:
\[ 40 + 40 = 80 \]

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
\[ 80 - 21 = 59 \]

Now, we need to determine the number of passengers who get on at the second stop. It is stated that 3 times fewer passengers get on than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, we need to find 3 times this number, which is $3 \times 21 = 63$. However, this is the number of passengers who did not get on, so we need to subtract this from the number who got off to find the number who got on. Therefore, the number of passengers who got on is $21 - 63 = -42$. Since we cannot have a negative number of passengers, this indicates that 63 more passengers got on than the number who got off. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that 63 more passengers got on than the number who got off, which is equivalent to $21 + 63 = 84$ passengers getting on.

So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is:
\[ 59 + 84 = 143 \]

The final answer is: $\boxed{143}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote Jame's current age as $J$ and his cousin's current age as $C$.

From the problem statement, we know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is $J = 27 - 5 = 22$ years.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. We can represent this as an equation:

$$C + 8 = 2(J + 8) - 5$$

Substituting $J = 22$ into the equation, we get:

$$C + 8 = 2(22 + 8) - 5$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$C + 8 = 2(30) - 5$$
$$C + 8 = 60 - 5$$
$$C + 8 = 55$$

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:

$$C = 47$$

Now that we have the current ages of Jame and his cousin, we can find the difference between their ages:

$$\text{Difference} = J - C = 22 - 47 = -25$$

However, since age cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of the difference:

$$\text{Difference} = | -25 | = 25$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the cost of one monitor, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the cost of the computer as C, the cost of the printer as P, and the cost of one monitor as M.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. C + 2M + P = 2400 (Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer)
2. C - P = 400 (The printer cost $400 less than the computer)
3. C = 1100 (Given cost of the computer)

We can use equation (3) to substitute the value of C in equation (2) to find the cost of the printer:
P = C - 400
= 1100 - 400
= 700

Now that we have the cost of the printer, we can substitute the values of C and P in equation (1) to find the cost of one monitor:
1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400
Combine like terms:
1800 + 2M = 2400
Subtract 1800 from both sides:
2M = 600
Divide both sides by 2:
M = 300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Given that 20 students were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys for a scavenger hunt, we can infer that there are 10 boys and 10 girls. The boys collected 60 seashells each, resulting in a total of 10 * 60 = 600 seashells.

The girls collected an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be expressed as 60 + 4 * 60. To calculate this, we first multiply 4 and 60, which equals 240. Then, we add 60 to this result, yielding 300. Therefore, the girls collected 300 more seashells than the boys.

To find the total number of seashells collected by the girls, we add the number of seashells collected by the boys (600) to the additional seashells collected by the girls (300), resulting in a total of 900 seashells.

Since there are 10 girls, we can determine the number of seashells collected by each girl by dividing the total number of seashells collected by the girls (900) by the number of girls (10), which equals 90.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the initial number of candies George had as x. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, the number of candies Nick had initially is 2x.

We are given that George ate 5 candies, and now he has 3 candies left. This can be represented by the equation x - 5 = 3. Solving for x, we get:

x - 5 = 3
x = 3 + 5
x = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick had initially by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2(8)
2x = 16

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine Anne's age, we can establish a linear relationship between the ages of Chenny, Alyana, and Anne. Given that Chenny is 10 years old, we can express Alyana's age as a function of Chenny's age, where Alyana's age is 4 years less than Chenny's age.

Let C represent Chenny's age, A represent Alyana's age, and N represent Anne's age. We can express the relationship between their ages as follows:

A = C - 4
N = A + 2

Substituting the value of C into the first equation, we get:

A = 10 - 4
A = 6

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the second equation to find Anne's age:

N = 6 + 2
N = 8

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the total thickness of the four books, we can calculate the thickness of each book individually and then sum them up.

Let's denote the thickness of the first book as $b_1$, the second book as $b_2$, the third book as $b_3$, and the fourth book as $b_4$.

We are given the following information:
- $b_1 = 31$ mm
- $b_2 = 50$ mm
- $b_3 = b_2 - 5 = 50 - 5 = 45$ mm
- $b_4 = 2b_1 = 2 \times 31 = 62$ mm

Now, we can calculate the total thickness of the four books by summing up their individual thicknesses:
\[ \text{Total thickness} = b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 = 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 \text{ mm} \]

The final answer is: $\boxed{188}$"
"To determine the number of vlogs Emma should make to complete her monthly goal, we can calculate the difference between her target and the vlogs she has already created.

Let's denote the total number of vlogs Emma aims to make as T = 72. The number of vlogs she has created so far can be represented as the sum of vlogs made in each week: V1 = 18 (first week), V2 = 21 (second week), and V3 = 15 (third week). The total vlogs made so far is the sum of these values: V_total = V1 + V2 + V3.

V_total = 18 + 21 + 15
V_total = 54

Now, we can find the number of vlogs Emma should make to reach her goal by subtracting the total vlogs made from her target: V_needed = T - V_total.

V_needed = 72 - 54
V_needed = 18

Therefore, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her monthly goal.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the total amount you paid for the dinner, we need to calculate the 20% tip on the $50 bill. This can be done by multiplying the bill by the decimal equivalent of 20%, which is 0.20.

The calculation is as follows:

Tip = 0.20 * $50
Tip = $10

Now, to find the total amount you paid, we add the tip to the original bill.

Total amount = $50 (bill) + $10 (tip)
Total amount = $60

Therefore, the total amount you paid for the dinner is $60."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a series of steps using basic algebraic manipulations.

Let's denote the eldest boy's initial share as $x. Since the total amount is shared among 3 boys, we have:

$$x + x + x = 18$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$3x = 18$$

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

$$x = 6$$

So, the eldest boy's initial share is $6.

Now, let's denote the amount he added to his share as $y. We are given that he added $5 to his share and then another $10 the following day. Therefore, the total amount he had after these additions is:

$$6 + 5 + 10 = 21$$

However, he spent $8 from his total, so we subtract this from the previous amount:

$$21 - 8 = 13$$

Finally, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8, so we multiply the previous amount by 3:

$$13 \times 3 = 39$$

Therefore, the eldest boy now has $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation to model the situation. Let's denote the number of days in the first half of April as x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be 30 - x.

Let y be the amount Elvis saves per day in the first half of the month. Then, the total amount saved in the first half is xy. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much per day in the second half as in the first half, the amount saved per day in the second half is 2y. The total amount saved in the second half is then 2xy.

The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is xy + 2xy = 3xy. Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so we can set up the equation:

3xy = 1125

We also know that x + (30 - x) = 30, which simplifies to 2x = 30, and x = 15.

Now we can substitute x = 15 into the equation 3xy = 1125 to find y:

3(15)y = 1125
45y = 1125

To find y, we divide both sides by 45:

y = 1125 / 45
y = 25

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the amount saved in the second half is 2y = 2(25) = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the change Verna received after purchasing fruits, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the amount she gave.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each can be calculated as 3 \* $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each can be calculated as 5 \* $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each can be calculated as 6 \* $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny, we can calculate their total earnings based on the number of tasks completed and the respective payment rates.

Let's denote the payment rate for Jairus as $0.8 per task and for Jenny as $0.5 per task. Given that both completed 20 tasks, we can calculate their total earnings as follows:

Jairus' total earnings = 0.8 \* 20 = $16
Jenny's total earnings = 0.5 \* 20 = $10

Now, we can find the difference in their earnings by subtracting Jenny's total earnings from Jairus' total earnings:

Difference in earnings = Jairus' total earnings - Jenny's total earnings = 16 - 10 = $6

Therefore, Jairus will receive $6 more than Jenny.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's share can be represented as 4x.

The total amount they are dividing is $100, so the sum of their shares is equal to 100. This can be expressed as the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 100

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 100 / 5
x = 20

Now that we know Brad's share, we can find Jeff's share by multiplying x by 4:

Jeff's share = 4x
= 4(20)
= 80

Therefore, Jeff gets $80.

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

Given that Jeff's workplace is 3 miles away, the round-trip distance to and from work is 2 times the one-way distance, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

Therefore, the total miles Jeff walks in a week is 30 miles.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we can break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which consists of 26 letters each time. Therefore, the total number of letters written in this step is 2 * 26 = 52.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once. Since the alphabet consists of 26 letters, half of it would be 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written. This includes the 52 letters from the first two instances of writing the alphabet in full, and the 13 letters from writing half of the alphabet. Therefore, the total number of letters she has written so far is 52 + 13 = 65.

Now, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. To find the total number of letters she has written, we add this to the previous total: 65 + 65 = 130.

The final answer is: $\boxed{130}$"
"This problem can be modeled as a geometric progression, where the number of families notified in each round is multiplied by a constant factor. In this case, the first term (a) is 3, and the common ratio (r) is also 3.

The formula to find the nth term of a geometric progression is given by:

an = a * r^(n-1)

We want to find the number of families notified in the fourth round, so n = 4. Plugging in the values, we get:

a4 = 3 * 3^(4-1)
a4 = 3 * 3^3
a4 = 3 * 27
a4 = 81

Therefore, the number of families notified in the fourth round is 81.

The final answer is: 81"
"To determine Mark's initial weight, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Mark's initial weight as 'x'. Since he lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, the total weight lost is 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds.

We know that his final weight is 70 pounds, which is the result of subtracting the total weight lost from his initial weight. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x - 30 = 70

To solve for x, we add 30 to both sides of the equation:

x = 70 + 30
x = 100

Thus, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we must first calculate the total number of toys in the larger play set. Given that James's play set has 80 toys and the larger play set is five times larger, we can express this relationship as a multiplication problem.

Let's denote the number of toys in the larger play set as $5 \times 80$. Performing this calculation yields:

$5 \times 80 = 400$

Now, we are informed that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. We can represent this relationship as an equation:

$x + 2 = 400$

where $x$ represents the number of toys Jonathan currently has. To solve for $x$, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

$x = 400 - 2$
$x = 398$

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{398}$"
"To determine the total cost of the items Daniel wants to purchase, we need to calculate the cost of each item individually and then apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

- The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 \* $1.50 = $7.50.
- The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 \* $0.25 = $0.50.
- The cost of 1 calculator at $12 each is $12.
- The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 each is $10.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Next, we need to apply the 10% discount to the total cost. To do this, we multiply the total cost by 0.10 to find the discount amount: 0.10 \* $30 = $3.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost: $30 - $3 = $27.

Therefore, Daniel will have to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

The final answer is: $27"
"To determine the change Carly receives after purchasing the items, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and subtract it from the $50 bill she pays with.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:

The cost of 5 hamburgers at $4 each is given by the product of the quantity and price: 5 × $4 = $20.

The cost of 10 packs of potato fries at $0.30 each is given by the product of the quantity and price: 10 × $0.30 = $3.

The cost of 5 cans of fruit drinks at $2 each is given by the product of the quantity and price: 5 × $2 = $10.

The total cost of the items is the sum of the individual costs: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Therefore, the change Carly receives is $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to apply the commission-based salary system. The system has two tiers: a base commission of 30% for the first $1000 in sales and an additional 10% commission for sales exceeding $1000.

Let's break down the calculation:

1. Calculate the commission for the first $1000: 
Commission = 0.3 * $1000 = $300

2. Calculate the sales exceeding $1000: 
Sales exceeding $1000 = $2500 - $1000 = $1500

3. Calculate the additional commission for the sales exceeding $1000: 
Additional commission = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

4. Calculate the total commission:
Total commission = Commission + Additional commission
Total commission = $300 + $150
Total commission = $450

Therefore, the total amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of bottles required for his party. Given that he has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles of water for each guest, the total number of bottles needed is 2 * 70 = 140.

Since Bill already has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, he has a total of 2 * 24 = 48 bottles. To find the number of additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles required: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to purchase 92 additional bottles of water.

The final answer is: 92"
"To determine the time difference in swimming 3 miles between a cold day and a hot day, we first need to establish the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in each condition.

Let's denote the time to swim a mile in cold water as $t_c$ and the time to swim a mile in warm water as $t_w$. We are given that $t_c = 16$ minutes. Additionally, we know that $t_w = 2t_c + 2$.

Substituting the value of $t_c$, we get $t_w = 2(16) + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34$ minutes.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in each condition. The time to swim 3 miles in cold water is $3t_c = 3(16) = 48$ minutes, and the time to swim 3 miles in warm water is $3t_w = 3(34) = 102$ minutes.

To find the difference in time between the two conditions, we subtract the time to swim 3 miles in cold water from the time to swim 3 miles in warm water:

$\Delta t = 3t_w - 3t_c = 102 - 48 = 54$ minutes.

Therefore, the time difference is 54 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the target savings by his weekly earnings.

First, let's calculate John's daily earnings, which is the product of his hourly wage and the number of hours he works per day:

$$
\text{Daily Earnings} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Hours Worked per Day}
$$

Given that John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, his daily earnings are:

$$
\text{Daily Earnings} = \$2 \times 5 = \$10
$$

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his daily earnings by the number of days he works per week:

$$
\text{Weekly Earnings} = \text{Daily Earnings} \times \text{Days Worked per Week}
$$

Since John works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:

$$
\text{Weekly Earnings} = \$10 \times 4 = \$40
$$

Now, we can determine the number of weeks it will take John to save $80 by dividing the target savings by his weekly earnings:

$$
\text{Number of Weeks} = \frac{\text{Target Savings}}{\text{Weekly Earnings}} = \frac{\$80}{\$40} = 2
$$

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total cost of lunch at Subway, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, which is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub.

Let's denote the cost of the foot-long fish sub as $F. Given that the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much as the foot-long fish sub, its cost can be expressed as 3F.

We are given that the cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40. Therefore, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is 3F = 3($40) = $120.

The total cost for both subs is the sum of their individual costs: F + 3F = $40 + $120 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To determine the total number of holes in the bag of buttons, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes separately and then summing these values.

Let's denote the number of buttons with 2 holes as $n_2$ and the number of buttons with 4 holes as $n_4$. We are given that $n_2 = 7$. The total number of buttons in the bag is 21, so the number of buttons with 4 holes is $n_4 = 21 - n_2 = 21 - 7 = 14$.

The total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes is $2n_2 = 2 \cdot 7 = 14$. The total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes is $4n_4 = 4 \cdot 14 = 56$.

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is $2n_2 + 4n_4 = 14 + 56 = 70$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the size of Peter's locker, we must first establish the relative sizes of the lockers. Given that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we can express the sizes of the other lockers as fractions of this value.

Let's denote Timothy's locker as T = 24 cubic inches. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so we can express this relationship as Z = T/2. Substituting the value of T, we get Z = 24/2 = 12 cubic inches.

Now, we need to find the size of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. We can express this relationship as P = Z/4. Substituting the value of Z, we get P = 12/4 = 3 cubic inches.

Therefore, the size of Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the amount by which Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we first need to establish the current amount he consumes. Given that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee and Juan drinks 10 times the amount she does, we can express this relationship as follows:

Let x be the daily recommended cups of coffee. Then, Octavia's coffee intake is x/2 cups, and Juan's coffee intake is 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

We are given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. Therefore, x = 4.

Now, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake:
Juan drinks 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups of coffee.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we can calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then sum them.

Let's denote the number of hamsters as H and the number of guinea pigs as G. We are given that there are 3 cages of hamsters and 3 cages of guinea pigs. Since each cage contains 10 hamsters and 5 guinea pigs, we can express the number of hamsters and guinea pigs as follows:

H = 3 * 10 = 30
G = 3 * 5 = 15

The total number of rodents (R) is the sum of the number of hamsters and guinea pigs:

R = H + G
R = 30 + 15
R = 45

Therefore, the pet shop has a total of 45 rodents.

The final answer is: 45"
"To determine the average weight of the three friends, we must first calculate their individual weights and then compute the mean of these values.

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so we can express her weight as $w_S = 150 - 20 = 130$ pounds. Bob's weight is twice that of Susan's, which can be represented as $w_B = 2w_S = 2(130) = 260$ pounds.

The total weight of the three friends is the sum of their individual weights: $w_T = w_M + w_S + w_B = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540$ pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of individuals, which is 3. Therefore, the average weight is $\frac{w_T}{3} = \frac{540}{3} = 180$ pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To determine the final angle from the ground to the sun, we can utilize trigonometric principles. Given that the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves 5 degrees per hour, we can calculate the total angle by multiplying the rate of change by the duration of the sun's movement.

Let's denote the initial angle of the pyramid as θ (theta) = 32 degrees and the rate of change of the sun's angle as dθ/dt = 5 degrees/hour. The time interval over which the sun moves is Δt = 10 hours.

The total angle moved by the sun is given by the product of the rate of change and the time interval:

Δθ = dθ/dt * Δt
= 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours
= 50 degrees

To find the final angle from the ground to the sun, we add the initial angle of the pyramid to the total angle moved by the sun:

θ_final = θ + Δθ
= 32 degrees + 50 degrees
= 82 degrees

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 82 degrees.

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine the total number of candles James needs to buy, we must first calculate the combined age of his two sons. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, so the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

The total number of candles required is the sum of their ages, which is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we can calculate the number of packs needed by dividing the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

The cost of 4 packs of candles is 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, the total number of minutes she read in the first week is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Given that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in 105 minutes by first finding the number of 1.5-minute intervals in 105 minutes. This can be done by dividing 105 by 1.5, which yields:

$$\frac{105}{1.5} = 70$$

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, the total number of pages she read in the first week is 2 * 70 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To determine the number of sandwiches remaining, we can start by calculating the number of sandwiches each individual consumed. 

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4$ sandwiches.

Similarly, Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3$ sandwiches.

The total number of sandwiches consumed by both Cody and Trevor is $4 + 3 = 7$ sandwiches.

To find the number of sandwiches remaining, we subtract the total number of sandwiches consumed from the initial number of sandwiches: $12 - 7 = 5$ sandwiches.

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's age today as x.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. 
In 7 years, his nephew's age will be x + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. 
So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 
First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: 

$$\frac{51}{3} = x + 7$$

This simplifies to:

$$17 = x + 7$$

Next, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

$$17 - 7 = x$$

This simplifies to:

$$x = 10$$

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break down the problem into distinct segments based on the payment structure.

For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left a fixed amount of $5.00.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left a constant amount of $1.00 per tooth, resulting in a total of $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. Therefore, the total for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon by summing the amounts for each segment: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To determine the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, the number of goals scored by Anna as A, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. R = M + 20 (Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark)
2. R = A + 45 (Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna)
3. R = 80 (Richie scored 80 goals)

We can substitute the value of R from equation (3) into equations (1) and (2):

1. 80 = M + 20
   M = 80 - 20
   M = 60

2. 80 = A + 45
   A = 80 - 45
   A = 35

Now that we have the values of M and A, we can find the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers:

Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers is 175."
"To determine the difference in earnings between Liam and Mitchell, we can calculate the total revenue generated by each individual. Mitchell's revenue can be calculated by multiplying the number of lemonades sold (21) by the price per lemonade ($4), which yields a total revenue of $84. 

Now, to find the difference in earnings, we subtract Liam's revenue ($63) from Mitchell's revenue ($84): $84 - $63 = $21.

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam selling lemonade that weekend.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and add them up.

Let's first calculate the number of wooden action figures Peter bought from Sunday through Wednesday. He spent $5 each day on wooden action figures, so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is 4 days * $5/day = $20. Since he spent $20, he bought 20 / 5 = 4 wooden action figures.

Now, let's calculate the number of plastic action figures Peter can buy from Thursday through Saturday. He has $70 - $20 = $50 left. He has 5 days left, and each plastic action figure costs $2. Therefore, the total number of plastic action figures he can buy is 50 / 2 = 25.

In total, Peter bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 4 + 25 = 29.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the total cost associated with Leah's kitten, we must consider the expenses incurred for spaying the animal, administering vaccines, and replacing the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is a fixed expense, which is $200. 

The cost of the vaccines can be calculated by multiplying the number of vaccines administered (3) by the cost per vaccine ($20), resulting in a total of $60.

The cost of the broken vases is calculated by multiplying the number of vases broken (4) by the cost per vase ($12), yielding a total of $48.

To obtain the total cost, we sum the individual expenses: $200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (broken vases) = $308.

Therefore, the total cost associated with Leah's kitten is $308."
"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is given by the sum of the roses ordered by each shop: 
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is: 
65 roses/week × 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is: 
40 roses/week × 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we can employ a straightforward financial calculation. Given that she removes $100 from the account every month, we can calculate the total amount removed over a 2-year period.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months. The amount removed each month is $100, so the total amount removed in 24 months is 24 \* $100 = $2400.

The initial amount in the account is $3000. To find the remaining amount, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

Therefore, the remaining amount in the account after 2 years is $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To determine the net profit of the food truck, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf yields 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30 per sandwich.

The cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches. To find the cost per sandwich, we divide the total cost by the number of sandwiches: $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00 per sandwich.

The total cost per sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and cheese and condiments: $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30 per sandwich.

The total revenue is the selling price per sandwich multiplied by the number of sandwiches sold: 10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $70.00 (revenue) - (10 sandwiches * $3.30 per sandwich) = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To determine the total revenue Kate can generate from selling her muffin crayons, we need to calculate the number of muffin crayons she can produce and then multiply that by the price of each muffin crayon.

First, let's calculate the total number of crayons Kate has. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we can express this as a simple multiplication problem:

Total crayons = Number of boxes × Crayons per box
Total crayons = 3 × 64
Total crayons = 192

Next, we need to determine how many muffin crayons Kate can make from the total number of crayons. Since she melts 8 crayons together to make one muffin crayon, we can express this as a division problem:

Number of muffin crayons = Total crayons ÷ Crayons per muffin crayon
Number of muffin crayons = 192 ÷ 8
Number of muffin crayons = 24

Now that we know Kate can make 24 muffin crayons, we can calculate the total revenue by multiplying the number of muffin crayons by the price of each muffin crayon:

Total revenue = Number of muffin crayons × Price per muffin crayon
Total revenue = 24 × $1.50
Total revenue = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the total cost of replacing the carpet in Michael's bedroom, we need to calculate the area of the room and the costs associated with the materials and labor.

First, we calculate the area of the bedroom, which is given by the product of its length and width. The length of the room is 18 feet, and the width is 12 feet. Therefore, the area of the room is:

Area = Length × Width
= 18 ft × 12 ft
= 216 sq ft

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the new carpet, padding, and labor.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is:

Cost of carpet = Area × Cost per square foot
= 216 sq ft × $12/sq ft
= $2592

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is:

Cost of padding = Area × Cost per square foot
= 216 sq ft × $2/sq ft
= $432

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is:

Cost of removal = Area × Cost per square foot
= 216 sq ft × $4/sq ft
= $864

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is:

Cost of installation = Area × Cost per square foot
= 216 sq ft × $34/sq ft
= $7344

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the materials and labor.

Total cost of materials = Cost of carpet + Cost of padding + Cost of removal
= $2592 + $432 + $864
= $3888

Total cost of labor = Cost of removal + Cost of installation
= $864 + $7344
= $8208

Finally, we can calculate the total cost to replace the carpet:

Total cost = Total cost of materials + Total cost of labor
= $3888 + $8208
= $12196

The final answer is: $12196"
"To calculate the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to employ a basic statistical concept known as the mean. The mean is calculated by summing up all the values in a dataset and then dividing by the number of values.

Let's denote the number of birds Mack saw on each day as follows:

- Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

We can calculate the total number of birds Mack saw over the week by adding up the values for each day:

Total birds = 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 120 + 20 + 90
Total birds = 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 120 + 20 + 90
Total birds = 350

Next, we need to determine the number of days over which Mack observed the birds. In this case, it's 7 days.

Now, we can calculate the average number of birds Mack saw in a day by dividing the total number of birds by the number of days:

Average birds per day = Total birds / Number of days
Average birds per day = 350 / 7
Average birds per day = 50

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the final value of the number train, we can break down the given operations step by step.

Let's denote the starting value of the number train as $x$. According to the problem, the starting value plus half the number is $x + \frac{x}{2}$. This expression can be simplified to $\frac{3x}{2}$.

The next operation involves dividing the resulting value by 5, which yields $\frac{3x}{2} \div 5 = \frac{3x}{10}$.

Finally, the resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 12, so we have $\frac{3x}{10} \cdot (x - 12)$.

Substituting the given starting value of 20 for $x$, we get $\frac{3(20)}{10} \cdot (20 - 12) = 6 \cdot 8 = 48$.

Therefore, the final value of the number train is 48."
"To determine the total number of cards the boy and his brother have together, we can start by identifying the number of cards each of them possesses. 

Let's denote the number of cards the boy has as B. We are given that his brother has 3 fewer cards than he does, so the number of cards his brother has can be expressed as B - 3.

We are also given that the boy has 5 cards. Therefore, we can set up the equation B = 5.

Now, we can substitute the value of B into the expression for the number of cards his brother has: B - 3 = 5 - 3 = 2.

To find the total number of cards they have together, we add the number of cards the boy and his brother have: B + (B - 3) = 5 + 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. This can be done by finding the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then dividing it by the set temperature.

Let's denote the set temperature as $T_s = 450^\circ$ and the actual temperature as $T_a = 468^\circ$. The percentage by which the oven is off can be calculated as:

$$\text{Percentage off} = \left( \frac{T_a - T_s}{T_s} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100\% = 4\%$$

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we can use this percentage to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to for a recipe that calls for $520^\circ$. Let's denote this temperature as $T_{\text{set}}$. We can set up the following equation:

$$T_{\text{set}} + (T_{\text{set}} \times \text{Percentage off}) = 520^\circ$$

Substituting the value of the percentage off, we get:

$$T_{\text{set}} + (T_{\text{set}} \times 0.04) = 520^\circ$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$T_{\text{set}} + 0.04T_{\text{set}} = 520^\circ$$

Combine like terms:

$$1.04T_{\text{set}} = 520^\circ$$

Divide both sides by 1.04:

$$T_{\text{set}} = \frac{520^\circ}{1.04}$$

$$T_{\text{set}} = 500^\circ$$

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to $500^\circ$ for the recipe that calls for $520^\circ$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{500}$"
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each film into minutes and then sum them. 

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. We can express this as a sum of hours and minutes: 1 hour + 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hour to minutes by multiplying 1 by 60, which yields 60 minutes. Adding the 30 minutes to this gives us 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for the first movie.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can express this as a sum of hours and minutes: 2 hours + 5 minutes. Converting the hours to minutes by multiplying 2 by 60 gives us 120 minutes. Adding the 5 minutes to this gives us 120 + 5 = 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we can find the total time by adding the time for both movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{215}$"
"To determine the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. This can be expressed as:

Let H represent Herb's house price, which is $76,000. The value of Juan's house can be calculated as follows:

H - 0.3H = 0.7H

Given that H = $76,000, we can substitute this value into the equation:

0.7H = 0.7($76,000)
= $53,200

Therefore, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

To find the combined value of the two houses, we add Herb's house price and Juan's house price:

Combined value = H + 0.7H
= 1.7H
= 1.7($76,000)
= $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To determine the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend, we need to calculate the number of cups and dishes each brought and then sum the total.

Let's denote the number of cups Judy bought as $c$. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, the number of dishes she bought is $2c$. Given that a dozen is equal to 12, we can express the number of cups Judy bought as $c = 12$.

Now, let's calculate the number of cups and dishes Judy brought: 
Judy's cups: $c = 12$
Judy's dishes: $2c = 2(12) = 24$

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so the number of dishes her friend brought is $24 + 20 = 44$. The number of cups her friend brought is given as 40.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes Judy brought: 
Judy's cups: $12$
Judy's dishes: $24$
Total Judy brought: $12 + 24 = 36$

Next, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes her friend brought: 
Friend's cups: $40$
Friend's dishes: $44$
Total friend brought: $40 + 44 = 84$

Now, let's add the total number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend: 
Total Judy brought: $36$
Total friend brought: $84$
Total brought by both: $36 + 84 = 120$

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost per pair of contacts, we need to calculate the total number of pairs of contacts and the total cost of the contacts.

First, let's find the number of pairs of contacts Pete uses per day. Since 90 single-use contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of pairs of contacts he uses per day as follows:

$$\frac{90 \text{ contacts}}{45 \text{ days}} = 2 \text{ contacts/day}$$

Since each pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts, the number of pairs of contacts Pete uses per day is:

$$\frac{2 \text{ contacts/day}}{2 \text{ contacts/pair}} = 1 \text{ pair/day}$$

Now, we can find the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will have:

$$2 \text{ boxes} \times 90 \text{ contacts/box} = 180 \text{ contacts}$$

Since Pete uses 1 pair of contacts per day, the total number of pairs of contacts he will have is:

$$180 \text{ contacts} \div 2 \text{ contacts/pair} = 90 \text{ pairs}$$

The cost of 2 boxes with a 10% discount is:

$$2 \text{ boxes} \times \$100/\text{box} = \$200$$

The discount is 10% of the original price, which is:

$$\$200 \times 0.10 = \$20$$

So, the total cost after the discount is:

$$\$200 - \$20 = \$180$$

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts:

$$\frac{\$180}{90 \text{ pairs}} = \$2 \text{ per pair}$$

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings based on their respective work hours and hourly wage.

Jill worked a total of 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, resulting in a total of 3 hours of work. Given her hourly wage of $10, her total earnings can be calculated as follows:

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Therefore, John's total work hours are 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings can be calculated as follows:

John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

To find the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:

Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total calories burned during her exercise routine. Given that she spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories per hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories per hour, we can calculate the total calories burned as follows:

Total calories burned = (2 hours * 500 calories/hour) + (1 hour * 600 calories/hour)
Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories
Total calories burned = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned, we can determine the total amount of water she needs to drink by dividing the total calories burned by 200 and then multiplying by 100.

Total water needed = (Total calories burned / 200) * 100
Total water needed = (1600 / 200) * 100
Total water needed = 8 * 100
Total water needed = 800 ml

The final answer is: $\boxed{800}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:

R = 0.99B

Additionally, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we have:

G = 1.01B

Now, we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3.01:

B = 1500

Now that we know the value of B, we can find the values of R and G:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485

G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To calculate the average typing speed of Jared, we need to find the arithmetic mean of his three measurements. The formula for the arithmetic mean is:

$$\text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of measurements}}{\text{Number of measurements}}$$

Given that Jared's typing speeds are 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM, we can calculate the sum of measurements as follows:

$$\text{Sum of measurements} = 47 + 52 + 57 = 156$$

Now, we can calculate the mean by dividing the sum of measurements by the number of measurements:

$$\text{Mean} = \frac{156}{3} = 52$$

Therefore, the average typing speed of Jared is 52 WPM.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52}$"
"To determine the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we can calculate the weight change for each scenario and then find the difference.

Let's denote the weight change per week as follows:
- Weight lost per week: $-1.25$ pounds
- Weight gained per week: $1.75$ pounds

Now, we can calculate the weight change after 5 weeks for each option:
- Weight change after 5 weeks (lost): $(-1.25 \text{ pounds/week}) \times 5 \text{ weeks} = -6.25 \text{ pounds}$
- Weight change after 5 weeks (gained): $(1.75 \text{ pounds/week}) \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}$

The difference in weight between the two options is the absolute value of the difference between the weight gained and the weight lost:
$|8.75 \text{ pounds} - (-6.25 \text{ pounds})| = |8.75 + 6.25| = 15 \text{ pounds}$

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we can use a combinatorial approach. Initially, Alex invites 100 people via email, and each of them invites 2 friends, resulting in a total of 100 + (100 * 2) = 300 people. This represents a recursive sequence where each person invited via email invites 2 additional people, leading to a total of 300 attendees.

However, Alex also invites 10 friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses, adding 18 more people to the total. To find the total number of people attending, we sum the initial 300 attendees with the additional 18, resulting in 300 + 18 = 318.

Since this count includes Alex herself, we must add 1 to the total to account for her presence. Therefore, the total number of people attending the event is 318 + 1 = 319.

The final answer is: 319"
"To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we can establish a linear progression of weights based on the given information. Let's denote the weight of the Affenpinscher as A, the Dachshund as D, the Papillon as P, and the Mastiff as M.

Given that the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, we can express this as D = 2A. Since the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds, we can substitute this value into the equation to obtain D = 2(10) = 20 pounds.

Next, we're told that the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. This can be represented as P = D/4. Substituting the value of D, we get P = 20/4 = 5 pounds.

Finally, the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, which can be expressed as M = 44P. Substituting the value of P, we find M = 44(5) = 220 pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{220}$"
"To determine the cost difference between purchasing the boots on Amazon and eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of each option.

The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16, and the shipping cost is $4. Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and the shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8. Thus, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference in cost between the two options, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of days it will take for the beanstalk to surpass Mark's second-story window, which is 20 feet off the ground, we can model this situation using exponential growth. The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet, and it doubles in height every day.

Let's denote the number of days as 'n'. The height of the beanstalk on the nth day can be represented by the equation:

h(n) = 4 * 2^(n-1)

We want to find the smallest value of 'n' for which h(n) > 20. This can be expressed as:

4 * 2^(n-1) > 20

Dividing both sides by 4:

2^(n-1) > 5

Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides to solve for 'n':

n - 1 > log2(5)

n > log2(5) + 1

Using a calculator to find the value of log2(5):

log2(5) ≈ 2.3219

n > 2.3219 + 1

n > 3.3219

Since 'n' represents the number of days, it must be an integer. Therefore, the smallest integer value of 'n' that satisfies the inequality is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount of protein John consumes per week, we first need to establish the protein content per unit of mushroom weight. Given that a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein percentage as follows:

Protein percentage = (Protein content / Weight of mushrooms) × 100
Protein percentage = (3 g / 100 g) × 100 = 3%

Now, we know that John consumes 200 grams of mushrooms daily. To find the daily protein intake, we can multiply the weight of mushrooms consumed by the protein percentage:

Daily protein intake = Weight of mushrooms consumed × Protein percentage
Daily protein intake = 200 g × 0.03 = 6 g

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the weekly protein intake by multiplying the daily protein intake by 7:

Weekly protein intake = Daily protein intake × 7
Weekly protein intake = 6 g/day × 7 days/week = 42 g/week

Therefore, John consumes 42 grams of protein per week from mushrooms.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's analyze the problem. We are given that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

x = 2(x - 5)

where x is Jerry's current age. Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To determine the number of hours George needs to work to pay for the dental work, we must first calculate the total cost of the procedure. The base price of each implant is $2000, and since George requires two implants, the total base cost is 2 × $2000 = $4000.

However, one of the implants will require a crown made of porcelain, which adds an additional $500 to the total cost. Therefore, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find the number of hours George needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $\frac{\$3900}{\$15} = 260$ hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{260}$"
"Given the problem, we can denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it is 3x.

The sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the number of gumballs Colby can purchase, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the given coins into their respective values in cents:

- 8 quarters = 8 × 25 cents = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 × 10 cents = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 × 5 cents = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 × 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, we can sum up the total amount of money Colby has:

Total amount of money = 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents
= 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can calculate the number of gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{69}$"
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we can calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then sum them together. 

First, let's consider the number of legs for each type of pet. Dogs have four legs, cats have four legs, and birds have two legs. 

The number of dogs in the store is 5, so the total number of dog legs is 5 * 4 = 20. The number of cats is 2, so the total number of cat legs is 2 * 4 = 8. The number of birds is 10, so the total number of bird legs is 10 * 2 = 20.

Now, we can sum the total number of legs together: 20 (dog legs) + 8 (cat legs) + 20 (bird legs) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we can apply a simple percentage increase calculation. The increase in weight is 50% of 8 pounds, which can be expressed as:

(50/100) × 8 = 0.5 × 8 = 4 pounds

Adding this increase to the original weight of 8 pounds yields:

8 + 4 = 12 pounds

However, Jamaal then reduces the weight by 2 pounds from this new weight. Therefore, the final weight he uses is:

12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we can break down the problem into manageable components. Let's analyze the situation step by step.

In the first year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. Additionally, he purchases 1 game per month for 12 months, resulting in 12 games. Therefore, the total number of games Steve acquires in the first year is 10 + 12 = 22 games.

In the second year, Steve receives 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He then purchases 2 games per month for 12 months, resulting in 24 games. Consequently, the total number of games Steve acquires in the second year is 5 + 24 = 29 games.

In the third year, Steve receives 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He then purchases 4 games per month for 12 months, resulting in 48 games. Therefore, the total number of games Steve acquires in the third year is 5 + 48 = 53 games.

To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we can sum the number of games acquired each year: 22 + 29 + 53 = 104 games.

The final numerical answer is: 104"
"To determine the time it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we can utilize the concept of uniform motion. The formula for uniform motion is given by:

d = rt

where d is the distance traveled, r is the rate of travel, and t is the time taken.

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate its rate as follows:

r = d / t
= 1200 miles / 3 hours
= 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use the same rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles:

t = d / r
= 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
= 5 hours

Therefore, the additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles is 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the individual production rates of Ruiz and Marissa. Given that Ruiz can produce 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours, we can calculate his hourly production rate as follows:

Ruiz's hourly production rate = Total production / Time
= 120 pounds / 2 hours
= 60 pounds per hour

Now, we are told that Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. Therefore, we can calculate Marissa's hourly production rate as follows:

Marissa's hourly production rate = (3/4) * Ruiz's hourly production rate
= (3/4) * 60 pounds per hour
= 45 pounds per hour

Next, we need to find the total amount of chocolates produced by both Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours. We can calculate this by multiplying their individual production rates by the number of hours worked:

Ruiz's total production = Ruiz's hourly production rate * Time
= 60 pounds per hour * 12 hours
= 720 pounds

Marissa's total production = Marissa's hourly production rate * Time
= 45 pounds per hour * 12 hours
= 540 pounds

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is the sum of their individual productions:

Total production = Ruiz's total production + Marissa's total production
= 720 pounds + 540 pounds
= 1260 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"
"To determine the amount of money Howard has left, we can calculate the total amount spent at the arcade and subtract it from the original amount.

Let's denote the amount spent on Monday as M. We are given that M = $8.

On Tuesday, Howard spends twice as much as Monday, so the amount spent on Tuesday is 2M = 2 * $8 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as Tuesday, so the amount spent on Wednesday is 4 * 2M = 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount spent at the arcade is the sum of the amounts spent on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:
M + 2M + 4M = 7M
Substituting M = $8, we get:
7M = 7 * $8 = $56

However, this is incorrect. The correct total amount spent is the sum of the individual amounts spent on each day:
$8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

To find the amount of money Howard has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount:
$100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we can break down the problem into two distinct periods: the first four hours and the subsequent two hours.

During the initial four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.50 per cup. The total number of cups sold during this period can be calculated as follows:

$$\text{Total cups sold in 4 hours} = 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups}$$

The total revenue generated from the sale of these cups is then calculated by multiplying the total number of cups sold by the price per cup:

$$\text{Total revenue in 4 hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30$$

In the subsequent two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.60 per cup. The total number of cups sold during this period can be calculated as follows:

$$\text{Total cups sold in 2 hours} = 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups}$$

The total revenue generated from the sale of these cups is then calculated by multiplying the total number of cups sold by the price per cup:

$$\text{Total revenue in 2 hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12$$

To find the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we add the revenues from the two periods:

$$\text{Total revenue} = \text{Total revenue in 4 hours} + \text{Total revenue in 2 hours} = \$30 + \$12 = \$42$$

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the lifespan of the tires, we need to calculate the total number of rotations they can undergo before needing replacement and then divide that by the number of rotations they experience per month.

Given that the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the total number of rotations per mile as follows:

Rotations per mile = 725 rotations / 2 miles
Rotations per mile = 362.5 rotations/mile

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles per month, the total number of rotations per month is:

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 362.5 rotations/mile
Rotations per month = 145,000 rotations/month

Now, we can calculate the total number of months the tires can last before needing replacement:

Total rotations allowed = 10,440,000 rotations
Rotations per month = 145,000 rotations/month

Months before replacement = Total rotations allowed / Rotations per month
Months before replacement = 10,440,000 / 145,000
Months before replacement = 72

To find the number of years, we divide the total months by 12:

Years before replacement = Months before replacement / 12
Years before replacement = 72 / 12
Years before replacement = 6

"To determine the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and subtract it from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt:
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 \* $25 = $7.50

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt:
Discounted price of the shirt = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
Total cost = Discounted price of the shirt + Price of the shorts
Total cost = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we don't need to calculate it separately. Now, let's subtract the total cost from the amount Joe has:
Amount left = $50 - $52.50 = -$2.50

Since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Joe does not have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: -$2.50"
"To determine the amount of butter required to make 4 dozen croissants per day for a week, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants produced. Since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, we can calculate the total number of croissants as follows:

Total number of croissants = 4 dozen/day * 7 days
= 4 * 12 * 7
= 336 croissants

Next, we need to determine the amount of butter required to make 1 dozen croissants. It is given that 1/4 pound of butter is needed to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, the amount of butter required to make 336 croissants is:

Butter required = 336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant)

"To determine the cost difference in repaving Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street. The cost per meter is $194, and the lengths of the streets are 150 meters and 490 meters, respectively.

The cost to repave Monica's street can be calculated as follows:

Cost to repave Monica's street = Cost per meter × Length of Monica's street
= $194 × 150
= $29,100

Similarly, the cost to repave Lewis' street is:

Cost to repave Lewis' street = Cost per meter × Length of Lewis' street
= $194 × 490
= $95,060

Now, to find the difference in cost, we subtract the cost to repave Monica's street from the cost to repave Lewis' street:

Difference in cost = Cost to repave Lewis' street - Cost to repave Monica's street

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to calculate the cost for the initial 5 months and the cost for the remaining 45 months.

The initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000. This is a fixed cost, which we can denote as C_initial = $100,000.

For the remaining 45 months, the funding is 50% more than the initial funding. This can be expressed as a multiplier, m = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5, which represents a 50% increase. Therefore, the funding for the remaining months is C_remaining = C_initial * m = $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000 per month.

The total cost for the remaining 45 months is the product of the monthly cost and the number of months: C_remaining * 45 = $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the cost for the initial 5 months and the cost for the remaining 45 months:
C_total = C_initial + C_remaining * 45 = $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

"To determine the total number of posts in March, we need to calculate the total number of posts per day and then multiply it by the number of days in March.

Given that there are 1000 members in the Reddit group, each posting an average of 3 posts per day, we can calculate the total number of posts per day as follows:

Total posts per day = Number of members * Posts per member per day
= 1000 members * 3 posts/member
= 3000 posts/day

Since March has 31 days, we can calculate the total number of posts in March by multiplying the total number of posts per day by the number of days in March:

Total posts in March = Total posts per day * Number of days in March
= 3000 posts/day * 31 days
= 93,000 posts

Therefore, the total number of posts in March is 93,000."
"To determine the annual expenditure on water for laundry, we must first calculate the total amount of water used in a year. Given that Gary performs laundry twice a week, the frequency of laundry can be expressed as 2 loads/week. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of laundry loads in a year is 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year.

Each load of laundry requires 20 gallons of water. Therefore, the total amount of water used in a year is 104 loads/year * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons/year.

The cost of a gallon of water is $0.15. Consequently, the total annual expenditure on water for laundry is 2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year.

"To determine the total amount Scarlett spent, we can apply basic arithmetic operations to calculate the cost of each item and then sum the results.

First, let's calculate the cost of the rocks and coral. The cost of 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each is given by 2 \* $2.50 = $5.00. Similarly, the cost of 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each is 3 \* $2.00 = $6.00.

Next, we calculate the cost of the fish. Since there are 20 fish at $0.50 each, the total cost is 20 \* $0.50 = $10.00.

We also need to account for the cost of the fish food, which is $2.00.

Now, we can sum the costs of all the items: $10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00.

"To determine the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat he sells in a day and then divide the total weight of the bull's meat by that amount.

Prince's daily meat sales can be calculated by multiplying the amount of meat he sells per hour (15 kg) by the number of hours he works in a day (10 hours). This yields a daily sales rate of 15 kg/hour * 10 hours = 150 kg/day.

Given that the bull weighs 750 kg, we can calculate the number of days it will take to sell the meat by dividing the total weight of the bull's meat by Prince's daily sales rate: 750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days.

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

Total seats = 4 * 18
Total seats = 72

Next, we need to find the number of seats occupied by the administrators, which is one-fourth of the total number of seats.

Administrators = (1/4) * Total seats
Administrators = (1/4) * 72
Administrators = 18

Now, we calculate the remaining seats after the administrators have occupied their seats.

Remaining seats = Total seats - Administrators
Remaining seats = 72 - 18
Remaining seats = 54

We are then given that one-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. To find the number of seats occupied by the parents, we can use the following calculation:

Parents = (1/3) * Remaining seats
Parents = (1/3) * 54
Parents = 18

Finally, to determine the number of students, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats.

Students = Remaining seats - Parents
Students = 54 - 18
Students = 36

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the total number of functioning street lights, we must first calculate the total number of street lights and then subtract the number of non-functioning lights.

Given that each pole at a road intersection has 4 street lights and there are 6 poles at each intersection, we can calculate the total number of poles as follows:

Total number of poles = Number of poles per intersection * Number of intersections
Total number of poles = 6 * 4
Total number of poles = 24

Since each pole has 4 street lights, the total number of street lights is:

Total number of street lights = Total number of poles * Number of street lights per pole
Total number of street lights = 24 * 4
Total number of street lights = 96

However, we are given that 20 street lights are not functioning. Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is:

Total number of functioning street lights = Total number of street lights - Number of non-functioning lights
Total number of functioning street lights = 96 - 20
Total number of functioning street lights = 76

The final answer is: 76"
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to consider the remaining number of plays for each DVD. 

Let's denote the number of times DVD 1 can be played as $P_1$ and the number of times DVD 2 can be played as $P_2$. We know that each DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks. Therefore, we have:

$P_1 = 1000 - 356 = 644$
$P_2 = 1000 - 135 = 865$

Now, we can find the total number of times both DVDs can be played by adding the remaining plays for each DVD:

$P_{total} = P_1 + P_2 = 644 + 865 = 1509$

The final answer is: $\boxed{1509}$"
"To determine the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours he attended physical therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

Given that John attended physical therapy for 6 weeks, twice a week, for 2 hours at a time, we can calculate the total number of sessions as follows:

Total number of sessions = 6 weeks * 2 sessions/week = 12 sessions

Since each session lasted for 2 hours, the total number of hours can be calculated as:

Total hours = 12 sessions * 2 hours/session = 24 hours

The cost per hour of physical therapy is $125. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated as:

Total cost = Total hours * Cost per hour
           = 24 hours * $125/hour
           = $3000

The total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000."
"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews and subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school, and the school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the number of pieces he chews as follows:

$$\frac{8\text{ hours}}{2\text{ hours/piece}} = 4\text{ pieces}$$

In addition to the pieces he chews at school, Jim also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. Therefore, the total number of pieces he chews is:

$$4\text{ pieces} + 1\text{ piece} + 1\text{ piece} = 6\text{ pieces}$$

Now, let's subtract the total number of pieces he chews from the initial amount of gum:

$$20\text{ pieces} - 6\text{ pieces} = 14\text{ pieces}$$

After giving half of the remaining gum to his sister, we can calculate the number of pieces he gives her as follows:

$$\frac{14\text{ pieces}}{2} = 7\text{ pieces}$$

Finally, we subtract the number of pieces he gives to his sister from the remaining amount:

$$14\text{ pieces} - 7\text{ pieces} = 7\text{ pieces}$$

Therefore, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we first need to calculate her current age. Given that she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can use a simple algebraic approach to find her current age.

Let's denote Charmaine's current age as 'x'. Since she will be 16 in 12 years, we can set up the equation:

x + 12 = 16

To solve for 'x', we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

x = 16 - 12
x = 4

Now that we know Charmaine's current age is 4, we can calculate her age 4 years from now by adding 4 to her current age:

Age 4 years from now = x + 4
Age 4 years from now = 4 + 4
Age 4 years from now = 8

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the difference in the amount spent by the two coaches, we can calculate the total expenditure for each coach and then find the difference between the two totals.

The baseball coach purchased 9 baseballs at a cost of $3 each, so the total expenditure for the baseball coach is given by the product of the number of baseballs and the cost per baseball:

9 \* $3 = $27

The basketball coach, on the other hand, purchased 8 basketballs at a cost of $14 each, so the total expenditure for the basketball coach is given by the product of the number of basketballs and the cost per basketball:

8 \* $14 = $112

Now, we can find the difference between the two totals by subtracting the expenditure of the baseball coach from that of the basketball coach:

$112 - $27 = $85

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.

The final answer is: $85"
"To determine the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers. Given that there are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row, the total number of flowers can be calculated as follows:

Total number of flowers = Number of rows × Number of flowers per row
= 10 × 20
= 200

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we can calculate the number of bloomed flowers by multiplying the total number of flowers by 4/5:

Number of bloomed flowers = (4/5) × Total number of flowers
= (4/5) × 200
= (4 × 200) / 5
= 800 / 5
= 160

Therefore, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to perform a series of conversions. 

First, we'll convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we can express this conversion as a ratio:

$$\frac{1 \text{ Mb}}{1000 \text{ kb}}$$

To convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s, we divide 20 by 1000:

$$\frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s}$$

Next, we need to convert her speed from Mb/s to Mb/hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply her speed in Mb/s by 3600:

$$0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h}$$

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb/h.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the truck, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of cars towed on the first three days and the number of cars towed on the remaining days.

Let's denote the number of cars towed on each of the first three days as $n$. Since the truck towed 10 cars on each of these days, we have $n = 10$. The total number of cars towed on the first three days is then $3n = 3(10) = 30$.

For the remaining days, the truck towed 4 fewer cars than on the first three days, so the number of cars towed on each of these days is $10 - 4 = 6$. There are 7 - 3 = 4 remaining days, so the total number of cars towed on these days is $4(6) = 24$.

The total number of cars towed that week is the sum of the number of cars towed on the first three days and the number of cars towed on the remaining days, which is $30 + 24 = 54$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Adam to reach the required height to ride the roller coaster, we can use a simple linear growth model. Given that Adam's height is currently 40 inches and he grows at a rate of 2 inches per year, we can calculate the time it will take for him to reach the required height of 48 inches.

Let's denote the number of years it will take for Adam to reach the required height as 't'. We can set up the following equation based on the linear growth model:

40 + 2t = 48

To solve for 't', we can subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

2t = 8

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate 't':

t = 8 / 2
t = 4

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to reach the required height to ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine James' earnings from selling the used cars, we need to calculate the profit from the sales and then apply his commission rate to that profit.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cars. Since James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, the total revenue is given by:

Total Revenue = Number of Cars × Price per Car
= 10 × $25,000
= $250,000

Next, we need to calculate the company's cost to acquire the cars, which is 30% of the total revenue. This can be expressed as:

Company's Cost = 0.3 × Total Revenue
= 0.3 × $250,000
= $75,000

Now, we can calculate the profit from the sales by subtracting the company's cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Company's Cost
= $250,000 - $75,000
= $175,000

Finally, we need to calculate James' commission on the profit, which is 10% of the profit:

Commission = 0.1 × Profit
= 0.1 × $175,000
= $17,500

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To determine the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright. Given that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we can express this as a decimal and multiply it by the total number of riders:

25% = 0.25

Total number of riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25
= 25

Next, we need to find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we can express this as a decimal and multiply it by the total number of riders who can stay upright:

60% = 0.6

Number of women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6
= 15

Now, we can find the number of men who can stay upright by subtracting the number of women who can stay upright from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

Number of men who can stay upright = Total number of riders who can stay upright - Number of women who can stay upright
= 25 - 15
= 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can establish a relationship between the prices of the three jewels. Let's denote the price of the diamond jewel as D, the price of the gold jewel as G, and the price of the silver jewel as S.

We are given that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

G = (4/5)D

Substituting the given value of D, we get:

G = (4/5) * 2000
G = 1600

We are also given that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. This can be expressed as:

S = G - 400

Substituting the value of G, we get:

S = 1600 - 400
S = 1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = D + G + S
= 2000 + 1600 + 1200
= 4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we can use a systematic approach. Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

Given that Max bought 16 snowflake stamps, we have S = 16.

We are also told that he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, T = S + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19.

Furthermore, it is stated that he bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Hence, R = T - 9 = 19 - 9 = 10.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we can simply add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps: S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To determine the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to consider the relative speed between them. The relative speed is the difference between their speeds, which is 70 mph (Tom's speed) - 55 mph (Bob's speed) = 15 mph.

This relative speed represents the rate at which the distance between them decreases. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Relative Speed

Given that the distance between them is 75 miles, we can substitute the values into the formula:

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph

To solve for time, we can divide 75 by 15:

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of fish Tommy caught, we can establish a linear relationship between the number of fish caught by each individual. Let's denote the number of fish caught by Naomi as N, Darren as D, and Tommy as T.

Given that Naomi caught 17 fish, we can express Darren's catch as D = N - 6. Substituting N = 17 into this equation yields D = 17 - 6 = 11.

Now, we are told that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Therefore, we can express Tommy's catch as T = D + 3. Substituting D = 11 into this equation gives us T = 11 + 3 = 14.

Thus, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny attends at $6 per class as x and the number of classes he attends at $10 per class as y. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

We can set up the equation:

6x + 10y = 60

Since Manny can't attend a fraction of a class, we need to find the maximum whole number of classes he can attend at $6 per class.

We can start by trying different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

To simplify the equation, we can divide both sides by 2:

3x + 5y = 30

Now, we can try different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

If x = 1, 3(1) + 5y = 30
3 + 5y = 30
5y = 27
y = 5.4 (not a whole number)

If x = 2, 3(2) + 5y = 30
6 + 5y = 30
5y = 24
y = 4.8 (not a whole number)

If x = 3, 3(3) + 5y = 30
9 + 5y = 30
5y = 21
y = 4.2 (not a whole number)

If x = 4, 3(4) + 5y = 30
12 + 5y = 30
5y = 18
y = 3.6 (not a whole number)

If x = 5, 3(5) + 5y = 30
15 + 5y = 30
5y = 15
y = 3

Since x = 5 and y = 3 is a whole number solution, Manny can attend 5 classes at $6 per class and 3 classes at $10 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to calculate their individual daily and weekly production rates.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Given that there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production can be calculated as follows:

Jewel's daily production = 50 customers/day
Jewel's weekly production = 50 customers/day * 7 days/week = 350 customers/week

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, her daily production rate is twice that of Jewel's. Therefore, Julie's daily production is:

Julie's daily production = 2 * Jewel's daily production = 2 * 50 customers/day = 100 customers/day

Now, we can calculate Julie's weekly production:

Julie's weekly production = Julie's daily production * 7 days/week = 100 customers/day * 7 days/week = 700 customers/week

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions:

Total weekly production = Jewel's weekly production + Julie's weekly production = 350 customers/week + 700 customers/week = 1050 customers/week

The final answer is: $\boxed{1050}$"
"To determine the distance Lynn ran, we can establish a relationship between the distances covered by Reggie, Lynn, and Paisley. 

Let's denote the distance Lynn ran as L, the distance Reggie ran as R, and the distance Paisley ran as P. We are given that Paisley ran 4 miles, so P = 4. 

We are also given that Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which can be expressed as R = 5P. Substituting the value of P, we get R = 5(4) = 20 miles.

Furthermore, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, which can be expressed as R = L + 3. Substituting the value of R, we get 20 = L + 3.

To find the distance Lynn ran, we can solve for L by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: L = 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we can first calculate the unit price of each fruit. The unit price is the cost per unit of the item.

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the unit price of one apple is $5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30. Therefore, the cost of 5 apples is 5 × $1.30 = $6.50.

Similarly, the cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the unit price of one orange is $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10. Therefore, the cost of 5 oranges is 5 × $1.10 = $5.50.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the hole, is given by the formula:

V = lwh

where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth) of the prism.

Given that the length (l) is 6 feet, the width (w) is 4 feet, and the depth (h) is 3 feet, we can calculate the volume as follows:

V = lwh
V = (6 ft)(4 ft)(3 ft)
V = 72 cubic feet

Now, we need to determine the time it will take Bob to dig the hole. We are given that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the time it will take to dig the hole is equal to the volume of the hole multiplied by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

t = V * t_per_cubic_foot
t = 72 cubic feet * 3 seconds/cubic foot
t = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

The final answer is: $\boxed{216}$"
"To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $\frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To determine Tim's total annual income, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and bonus, then multiply the total monthly income by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } \$20,000 = 0.05 \times \$20,000 = \$1,000 \]
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary:
Bonus = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly income:
Total monthly income = New monthly salary + Bonus = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

Finally, let's calculate the total annual income:
Total annual income = Total monthly income \* 12 = $31,000 \* 12 = $372,000

"To determine the total cost of James' wardrobe, we need to calculate the cost of each item and sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits. The cost of each suit is $750, and James buys 10 suits. Therefore, the total cost of the suits is:

10 \* $750 = $7500

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the dress pants. The cost of each dress pant is 1/5 of the cost of a suit, which is (1/5) \* $750 = $150. Since James buys 10 dress pants, the total cost of the dress pants is:

10 \* $150 = $1500

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he buys 10 suits. Therefore, the total number of dress shirts is 10 \* 3 = 30. The cost of each dress shirt is $60, so the total cost of the dress shirts is:

30 \* $60 = $1800

Now, we can sum up the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts to find the total cost of James' wardrobe:

$7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800

The final answer is: $10800"
"To determine the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by each website and then add them together.

The news website publishes an average of 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. Therefore, the total number of articles published by the news website can be calculated as follows:

Total articles (news website) = 20 articles/day * 28 days
= 20 * 28
= 560 articles

The sister company publishes an average of 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. Thus, the total number of articles published by the sister company can be calculated as follows:

Total articles (sister company) = 10 articles/day * 28 days
= 10 * 28
= 280 articles

Now, we can find the total number of articles published by both websites by adding the total number of articles published by each website:

Total articles = Total articles (news website) + Total articles (sister company)
= 560 articles + 280 articles
= 840 articles

"To determine the age of Steve's son's wife, we can break down the information provided into a series of logical steps.

Let's denote Steve's age as S, his wife's age as W, their son's age as C, and their son's wife's age as SW. We are given the following information:

1. S = 60
2. W = S + 4
3. C = W / 2
4. SW = C - 3

Substituting the value of S into equation (2), we get W = 60 + 4 = 64.

Now, we can substitute the value of W into equation (3) to find C: C = 64 / 2 = 32.

Finally, we can substitute the value of C into equation (4) to find SW: SW = 32 - 3 = 29.

"To determine the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

Given that each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion. This yields:

Total flour in one bag = Number of portions × Weight of each portion
= 8 × 2 kg
= 16 kg

Now, to find the total amount of flour in three bags, we can simply multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3:

Total flour in three bags = Total flour in one bag × 3
= 16 kg × 3
= 48 kg

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms.

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we can apply the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time. 

For Alisa, who biked at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, the distance covered is given by:

d_A = v_A * t_A
= 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
= 54 miles

For Stanley, who biked at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, the distance covered is given by:

d_S = v_S * t_S
= 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours
= 25 miles

The total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley is the sum of their individual distances:

d_total = d_A + d_S

"To determine the time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add them together.

The rate at which Bill can dig through soil is 4 feet/hour, and the rate at which he can dig through clay is half that, or 2 feet/hour. 

The time it takes to dig through the soil can be calculated as follows:

Time to dig through soil = Depth of soil / Rate of digging through soil
= 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
= 6 hours

The time it takes to dig through the clay can be calculated as follows:

Time to dig through clay = Depth of clay / Rate of digging through clay
= 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
= 4 hours

The total time to dig the well is the sum of the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay:

Total time to dig the well = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
= 6 hours + 4 hours
= 10 hours

Therefore, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

This can be represented as the sum of the number of classmates and the additional individuals (Howie and his teacher).

Let's denote the number of classmates as $n$. The total number of people is then given by $n + 2$ (Howie and his teacher). We are given that $n = 25$.

Total number of people = $n + 2 = 25 + 2 = 27$

Since Howie wants to get one of each flavor (vanilla and chocolate) for each person, we need to multiply the total number of people by 2.

Total number of cupcakes = $2 \times (n + 2) = 2 \times 27 = 54$

Therefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach based on the given information.

Let's denote the initial number of likes as L. We are given that Fishio received 2000 likes initially, so L = 2000.

After 1 week, the number of likes remains the same, which is 2000.

Three weeks later, the number of likes is 70 times the initial number of likes. Therefore, the number of likes after 3 weeks is 70L = 70(2000) = 140000.

However, we are also given that Fishio received 20000 more new likes recently. This implies that the number of likes after 3 weeks is the sum of the initial likes, the likes received in the 3 weeks, and the 20000 new likes.

Let's denote the number of likes received in the 3 weeks as x. Then, we can write the equation:

L + x + 20000 = 140000

Substituting L = 2000, we get:

2000 + x + 20000 = 140000

Combine like terms:

21000 + x = 140000

Subtract 21000 from both sides:

x = 119000

Now, we can find the total number of likes by adding the initial likes, the likes received in the 3 weeks, and the 20000 new likes:

Total likes = L + x + 20000
= 2000 + 119000 + 20000
= 138000 + 20000
= 158000

The final answer is: $\boxed{158000}$"
"To determine the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two costs.

On the first day, Clara purchased 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she received a $2 discount due to a voucher. The total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = (Number of pomegranates) × (Price per pomegranate) - (Discount)
= 20 × $20 - $2
= $398

On the second day, the price per pomegranate increased to $30, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost without the discount is:

Total cost = (Number of pomegranates) × (Price per pomegranate)
= 20 × $30
= $600

The discount is 10% of the total cost, which is:

Discount = (Total cost) × (Discount percentage)
= $600 × 0.1
= $60

The total cost with the discount is:

Total cost = Total cost - Discount
= $600 - $60
= $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

Difference = Total cost (Day 1) - Total cost (Day 2)
= $398 - $540
= -$142

The final answer is: $142"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Given that Ariadne's sales from red hats in a particular month were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can express this relationship as:

Let G represent the total sales from green hats in the first month. Then, the sales from red hats in the first month is $400, which is half of G, so G/2 = $400.

To find G, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = 2 * $400
G = $800

Thus, in the first month, Ariadne's total sales from green hats were $800 and from red hats were $400.

The total sales in the first month are $800 + $400 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month are:

(3/4) * $1200
= (3/4) * (800 + 400)
= (3/4) * 800 + (3/4) * 400
= 600 + 300
= $900

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months:

$1200 + $900 = $2100

The final answer is: $2100"
"To determine the total cost of hiring the horse-drawn carriage, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the total cost of those hours.

Let's denote the cost of the first hour as $15. Since each subsequent hour costs twice the cost of the first hour, we can express the cost of the second hour as 2 * $15 = $30, and the cost of the third hour as 2 * $30 = $60.

Given that James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours, and he receives 1 hour of free service, he is only charged for 3 hours. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Cost of the first hour + Cost of the second hour + Cost of the third hour
= $15 + $30 + $60
= $105

The final answer is: $105"
"To determine the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we can calculate the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount she received. 

Let's denote the expected wage as E, the initial amount in her account as I, and the actual amount she received as A. We know that her expected wage is $300, the initial amount in her account is $200, and the actual amount she has now is $420.

We can express the expected total amount in her account as the sum of her initial amount and her expected wage: E + I. Since she received no other money into her account, this is the amount she should have had if she received her full wage.

E + I = $300 + $200 = $500

Now, we can find the difference between the expected total and the actual amount to determine the amount withheld: 

Amount withheld = (E + I) - A
Amount withheld = $500 - $420
Amount withheld = $80

Therefore, the amount withheld from Sally's wage is $80."
"To determine the number of eggs Lori needs for her party, we must first calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required. Given that each guest will consume 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests, we can use the formula:

Total deviled egg halves = Number of guests × Number of deviled egg halves per guest
Total deviled egg halves = 16 × 3
Total deviled egg halves = 48

Since each whole egg yields 2 deviled egg halves, we can calculate the number of eggs needed by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2:

Number of eggs = Total deviled egg halves ÷ 2
Number of eggs = 48 ÷ 2
Number of eggs = 24

To determine the number of dozens of eggs required, we divide the total number of eggs by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen:

Number of dozens of eggs = Number of eggs ÷ 12
Number of dozens of eggs = 24 ÷ 12
Number of dozens of eggs = 2

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozen eggs for her party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we can calculate the fraction of the paper that remains to be completed. Since she has already finished 1/3 of the paper, the fraction of the paper left to write is 2/3.

Let's denote the total number of pages as P. We can express the number of pages left to write as:

Pages left to write = P - (1/3)P
Pages left to write = (2/3)P

Given that the total number of pages is 15, we can substitute P = 15 into the equation:

Pages left to write = (2/3)(15)
Pages left to write = 10

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the number of days before the deadline that Mike will finish his reading, we can use a simple division to calculate the time required to complete the book.

Let's denote the total number of pages in the book as P, the number of pages Mike plans to read per day as R, and the total number of days available to complete the assignment as D. We can then express the time required to complete the book as P/R.

Given that P = 200 pages and R = 10 pages per day, we can calculate the time required to complete the book as follows:

Time required = P/R
= 200/10
= 20 days

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we can find the number of days before the deadline by subtracting the time required to complete the book from the total number of days:

Days before the deadline = D - Time required
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase price, the annual hanger rental, and the fuel expenses.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly hanger rental is $5,000. To calculate the annual hanger rental, we multiply this by 12, yielding $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $10,000 per month. Therefore, the annual fuel cost is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we sum the initial purchase price, the annual hanger rental, and the annual fuel cost: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To determine the total cooking time for Finley's meal, we can utilize a systematic approach by breaking down the given information.

Let's denote the cooking time for rice as $r$, the cooking time for pork as $p$, and the cooking time for beans as $b$. We are given that $r = 30$ minutes.

From the problem statement, we know that the cooking time for pork is 20 minutes more than the cooking time for rice. Therefore, we can express the cooking time for pork as $p = r + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50$ minutes.

Furthermore, we are informed that the cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is $r + p = 30 + 50 = 80$ minutes. Consequently, the cooking time for beans is $b = \frac{1}{2}(r + p) = \frac{1}{2}(80) = 40$ minutes.

To find the total cooking time, we can sum the individual cooking times for rice, pork, and beans: $r + p + b = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120$ minutes.

Therefore, the total cooking time for Finley's meal is 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost difference between two mixtures of almonds and walnuts, we can calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

Let's denote the cost of almonds as $A and the cost of walnuts as $W. Given that a pound of almonds costs $10 and a pound of walnuts costs $15, we have:

A = $10
W = $15

The first mixture consists of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. The total cost of this mixture can be calculated as:

C1 = (1/2)A + (1/3)W
C1 = (1/2)($10) + (1/3)($15)
C1 = $5 + $5
C1 = $10

The second mixture consists of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. The total cost of this mixture can be calculated as:

C2 = (1/5)A + (1/3)W
C2 = (1/5)($10) + (1/3)($15)
C2 = $2 + $5
C2 = $7

Now, we can find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

ΔC = C1 - C2
ΔC = $10 - $7
ΔC = $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let S denote the number of sheep and G denote the number of geese.

We are given that the total number of animal legs is 70, and since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can write the equation:

4S + 2G = 70

We are also given that the total number of animal heads is 20, and since each sheep and each goose has 1 head, we can write the equation:

S + G = 20

We can solve the second equation for G:

G = 20 - S

Substituting G = 20 - S into the first equation, we get:

4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

Expanding the equation, we get:

4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Combining like terms, we get:

2S + 40 = 70

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:

2S = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

S = 15

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of Roger's purchase, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately and then sum them.

First, let's find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. This can be calculated as follows:

Let x be the cost of the more expensive brand. Then, x = 5 + 0.2(5) = 5 + 1 = 6.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week. The cost of the more expensive coffee is therefore 7 * 6 = $42.

The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the coffee and the donut, which is $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we can utilize a basic arithmetic operation, specifically subtraction, to isolate the unknown variable. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus purchased:

2 bags of chips at $2.00 each = 2 × $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken: $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00
Adding the cost of the bottle of soda: $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, we can subtract the total cost of the items from the $20.00 Gus spent to find the cost of the apple pie:

$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The cost of the apple pie is $7.00."
"To determine the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we can utilize a simple arithmetic operation. Given that James delivers a total of 600 newspapers, and we know the number of newspapers delivered to District A (198) and District C (209), we can calculate the number of newspapers delivered to District B by subtracting the sum of the newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total.

Let's denote the number of newspapers delivered to District B as x. We can express this as an equation:

x = 600 - (198 + 209)

To solve for x, we first evaluate the expression within the parentheses:

198 + 209 = 407

Now, we can rewrite the equation as:

x = 600 - 407

To find the value of x, we perform the subtraction:

x = 600 - 407
x = 193

Therefore, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine the number of recipes John learns in the cooking class, we need to calculate the total class time and then divide it by the time it takes to learn a new recipe.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total class time per week is 4 × 2 = 8 hours. Since the class lasts for 6 weeks, the total class time is 8 × 6 = 48 hours.

Given that John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, we can calculate the total number of recipes he learns as follows:

Total class time (in hours) = 48
Time to learn a new recipe (in hours) = 1.5

Number of recipes learned = Total class time / Time to learn a new recipe
= 48 / 1.5
= 32

Therefore, John learns 32 new recipes in the cooking class.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we first need to calculate the number of math teachers on the school basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can find the number of history teachers as follows:

Number of history teachers = 0.6 * 150
= 90

Now, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers
= 150 - 90
= 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

Total time = Number of math teachers * Hours slept per day
= 60 * 6
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the amounts of money each person possesses. Let's denote the amount of money Aurelia has as A, Kassidy has as K, and Rayna has as R.

We are given that Aurelia has $120, so A = 120. We also know that Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, which can be expressed as K = (3/4)A. Substituting the value of A, we get K = (3/4)(120) = 90.

Furthermore, we are told that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, which can be represented as R = K + 60. Substituting the value of K, we get R = 90 + 60 = 150.

To find the total amount of money the three individuals possess, we can add their individual amounts: Total = A + K + R = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360.

If they decide to share this total amount equally among themselves, we can find the amount each person receives by dividing the total by 3: Amount per person = Total / 3 = 360 / 3 = 120.

Therefore, each person would have $120 if they decided to add their money together and share it equally.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the total duration of the basketball game, we need to calculate the sum of the regular game time and the extended time. The regular game consists of four quarters, each lasting 12 minutes. Therefore, the total regular game time is 4 * 12 = 48 minutes.

Since the game was extended by 5 minutes due to a tie in the last quarter, we add this additional time to the regular game time. Thus, the total duration of the game is 48 + 5 = 53 minutes.

The final answer is: 53"
"To determine the number of employees who oversee the company, we can break down the problem into manageable steps. 

First, we need to find 20% of the total number of employees, which is 50. This can be calculated as follows:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

Next, we need to find 30% of the result from the previous step, which represents the proportion of management employees overseeing the company. This can be calculated as follows:

30% of 10 = 0.30 * 10 = 3

Therefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total amount of dry ingredients required for 16 muffins, we need to calculate the individual amounts of flour, sugar, and salt needed.

The amount of flour required for 16 muffins can be calculated as follows:

Flour = 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 5 * 16 = 80 tablespoons

Similarly, the amount of sugar required is:

Sugar = 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 3 * 16 = 48 tablespoons

And the amount of salt required is:

Salt = 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 0.25 * 16 = 4 tablespoons

To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed, we add the individual amounts together:

Total dry ingredients = Flour + Sugar + Salt = 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons

Therefore, the total amount of dry ingredients required for 16 muffins is 132 tablespoons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{132}$"
"To determine the amount of candy each individual would have after sharing, we must first calculate the total amount of candy available. This can be achieved by summing the individual quantities of candy possessed by Robert, Cindy, and Aaron.

Let's denote the total amount of candy as $T$. Given that Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds, we can express this as:

$$T = 3 + 5 + 4$$

Simplifying the expression, we obtain:

$$T = 12$$

Now, to find the amount of candy each person would have after sharing, we divide the total amount of candy by the number of individuals, which is 3.

$$\text{Amount per person} = \frac{T}{3} = \frac{12}{3}$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$\text{Amount per person} = 4$$

Therefore, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy after sharing."
"To determine the change Adam received after purchasing the candies, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and subtract that from the amount he paid.

The cost of type A candies can be calculated as the product of the number of candies and the cost per candy: 7 candies * $0.5 = $3.50. Similarly, the cost of type B candies is 10 candies * $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is the sum of the costs of type A and type B candies: $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.00.

Since Adam paid $15, the change he received is the difference between the amount he paid and the total cost of the candies: $15 - $11.00 = $4.00.

Therefore, the change Adam received is $4.00."
"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to analyze Christina's mood pattern. We know that she had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. The first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the next 8 days were neutral.

Given that there are 30 days in the month, we can calculate the number of neutral days as follows:

Total days = 30
Good days = 12
Bad days = 8
Neutral days = Total days - (Good days + Bad days)
Neutral days = 30 - (12 + 8)
Neutral days = 30 - 20
Neutral days = 10

However, we are also given that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. This means that the 10 neutral days calculated above include the 1 neutral day in the sequence. Therefore, the number of neutral days before the sequence is 10 - 1 = 9.

Now, we can calculate the number of good days left in the month by subtracting the good days already accounted for (8 + 2 = 10) from the total number of good days:

Good days left = Total good days - Good days already accounted for
Good days left = 12 - 10
Good days left = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of books Sally has, we can establish an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:

Janey's books = 2x + 3

We are given that Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

"To determine the number of days required for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches, we first need to establish the current height in inches. Given that the initial height is 20 feet, we can convert this to inches by multiplying by 12, as there are 12 inches in a foot.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Next, we calculate the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we can determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches, given its growth rate of 30 inches per day. This can be calculated as follows:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take the bamboo 12 days to reach a height of 600 inches.

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, indicating a 1:1 ratio of toys to dogs. However, there are 8 additional dogs in the shelter, requiring 8 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 12 (4 initial toys + 8 additional toys).

Upon returning to the shelter, James observes that the number of dogs has doubled, from 8 to 16. Consequently, the total number of dogs in the shelter is now 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (initial additional dogs) + 16 (new dogs) = 28 dogs. Since each dog requires one toy, James needs 28 additional toys, bringing the total to 40 (12 initial toys + 28 additional toys).

However, upon his final visit, 3 dogs have been removed from the shelter, rendering 3 toys unnecessary. Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 40 (total toys needed so far) - 3 (toys no longer required) = 37 toys.

The final numerical answer is: 37"
"To determine the amount invested by Skyler, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, let's calculate the amount invested by Dylan. Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount, which is $1200. This can be expressed as:

Dylan's investment = (2/5) * 1200
Dylan's investment = 2/5 * 1200
Dylan's investment = (2 * 1200) / 5
Dylan's investment = 2400 / 5
Dylan's investment = 480

Now, we need to find the remaining amount after Dylan's investment. This can be calculated as:

Remaining amount = Total amount - Dylan's investment
Remaining amount = 1200 - 480
Remaining amount = 720

Next, we need to calculate the amount invested by Frances. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 720. This can be expressed as:

Frances' investment = (2/3) * 720
Frances' investment = 2/3 * 720
Frances' investment = (2 * 720) / 3
Frances' investment = 1440 / 3
Frances' investment = 480

Now, we need to find the remaining amount after Frances' investment. This can be calculated as:

Remaining amount = 720 - 480
Remaining amount = 240

Since the remaining amount is the amount invested by Skyler, we can conclude that Skyler's investment is $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the number of signatures the sisters need to collect to reach their goal, we first calculate the total number of signatures they have collected so far. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures.

Total signatures so far = 20 + 44 = 64

The sisters aim to collect a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need to collect, we subtract the total signatures they have from their goal.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36

Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, we can calculate the number of signatures they need to collect per week to reach their goal.

Signatures needed per week = 36 / 3 = 12

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 12 signatures per week for the remaining three weeks to reach their goal of 100 signatures.

6/36 = 1/6

This fraction represents the proportion of potatoes to hash browns. To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion:

6/36 = 96/x

We can then cross-multiply to solve for x:

6x = 96 * 36
6x = 3456
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To determine the excess weight in the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of the 9 adults and compare it to the maximum load capacity of the elevator.

The weight of a single adult is typically around 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of 9 adults can be calculated as follows:

Total weight = 9 \* 80 kg = 720 kg

Given that the elevator has a maximum load capacity of 700 kg, we can find the excess weight by subtracting the maximum load from the total weight:

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of cookies, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cookies Max has as M, the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as C, and the number of cookies Summer has as S.

We are given the following information:
1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: K = M - 5
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: M = C + 12
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: S = M + 23
4. Katarina has 68 cookies: K = 68

We can substitute the value of K from equation 4 into equation 1 to find the value of M:
M - 5 = 68
M = 68 + 5
M = 73

Now that we have the value of M, we can find the value of C using equation 2:
C = M - 12
C = 73 - 12
C = 61

Finally, we can find the value of S using equation 3:
S = M + 23
S = 73 + 23
S = 96

To find the total number of cookies, we add up the number of cookies each person has:
Total = K + M + C + S
Total = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
Total = 298

The final answer is: 298"
"To determine the original length of the dress, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the original length of the dress as 'x'. 

The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, which is equivalent to 0.5x. Additionally, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the total length of the extended dress is x + 0.5x + 20.

We are given that the final length of the dress is 140cm. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 0.5x + 20 = 140

Combine like terms:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

Therefore, the original length of the dress is 80cm.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we can calculate the time it took for each mode and then add them together.

Let's denote the total time to mow the lawn as T. Since Chris mowed half the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode, we can express this as:

T = (1/2) * (time in turtle mode) + (1/2) * (time in rabbit mode)

We know that the time in turtle mode is 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. The time in rabbit mode is 40 minutes.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

T = (1/2) * 60 + (1/2) * 40

To simplify the equation, we can first calculate the product of each term:

T = 30 + 20

Now, we can add the two terms to find the total time:

T = 50

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the remaining time for John and Jack to arrive at school without being late, we need to calculate the time elapsed to reach the fire station and subtract it from the total time available.

Given:
- Total time available = 30 minutes
- Time to reach the library = 6 minutes
- Time to reach the fire station from the library = 13 minutes

Time elapsed to reach the fire station = Time to reach the library + Time to reach the fire station from the library
Time elapsed to reach the fire station = 6 minutes + 13 minutes
Time elapsed to reach the fire station = 19 minutes

Remaining time to reach school = Total time available - Time elapsed to reach the fire station
Remaining time to reach school = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Remaining time to reach school = 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes to reach school without being late.

The final answer is: 11"
"To determine the total amount Catherine paid at the grocery store, we need to calculate the cost of each item and sum them together.

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4. The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 × $2 = $4. The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 × $3 = $6.

Now, let's calculate the total cost by adding the individual costs together: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14.

This can also be expressed as a mathematical expression: 1 × $4 + 2 × $2 + 2 × $3 = $14.

Therefore, the total amount Catherine paid is $14."
"To determine the number of cookies in the box, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda. 

Let's denote the number of cookies baked by Greta as G and the number of cookies baked by Celinda as C. We are given that Greta bakes 30 cookies, so G = 30. We are also given that Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, so C = 2G = 2(30) = 60.

The total number of cookies, T, is the sum of the cookies baked by Greta and Celinda, so T = G + C = 30 + 60 = 90.

However, Greta and Celinda eat 10 cookies while they are cooling, so the number of cookies left in the box, L, is given by L = T - 10 = 90 - 10 = 80.

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is 80.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, we have two equations based on the given information:

1. The sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44: T + (T+7) + t = 44
2. The older twin is 7 years older than the triplet: T+7 = t+7

We can simplify the second equation to find the relationship between T and t: T = t

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3t = 37

Divide by 3: t = 37/3

Simplify the fraction: t = 12.33

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, the problem asks for the age of one of the twins, and since we have two twins, we need to find the age of the older twin.

The age of the older twin is T+7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"
"To determine the time John has available for a nap, we must first calculate the total time he has before dinner and then subtract the time he spends on his homework.

Given that John has 3 hours before dinner, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. This yields:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Next, we need to calculate the total time John spends on his homework. This can be done by adding the time spent on math, reading, and history homework:

20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes

Now, we can subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to determine the time available for a nap:

180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes available for a nap."
"To determine the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to establish the cost of one candy. Given that the total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20, and the cost of each lollipop is $0.40, we can calculate the cost of the candies as follows:

Let's denote the cost of one candy as \(c\). The total cost of 5 lollipops is $2.00, which is given by the equation:

\[5 \times 0.40 = 2.00\]

We can verify this equation is true, as 5 multiplied by $0.40 indeed equals $2.00.

Now, we can find the cost of 4 candies by subtracting the cost of 5 lollipops from the total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies:

\[3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20\]

This implies that the cost of 4 candies is $1.20. To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of 4 candies by 4:

\[c = \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30\]

Now that we know the cost of one candy is $0.30, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

The cost of 10 lollipops is given by:

\[10 \times 0.40 = 4.00\]

The cost of 10 candies is given by:

\[10 \times 0.30 = 3.00\]

Therefore, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00\]

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Let's denote Rong's monthly savings as $R$ and Neil's monthly savings as $N$. We are given that Rong saves 20 coins per month, so $R = 20$. We are also given that Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so $N = R + \frac{2}{5}R = 20 + \frac{2}{5} \cdot 20 = 20 + 8 = 28$ coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: $R \cdot 12 = 20 \cdot 12 = 240$ coins
Neil's savings per year: $N \cdot 12 = 28 \cdot 12 = 336$ coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: $240 \cdot 10 = 2400$ coins
Neil's total savings: $336 \cdot 10 = 3360$ coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is $2400 + 3360 = 5760$ coins.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5760}$"
"To determine the amount John leaves with after visiting the vet, we need to calculate the total cost of the services provided. The cost of the vaccines is a straightforward $20 each, so the total cost for the two vaccines is 2 \* $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. The heartworm check can be expressed as 0.6x. Therefore, the total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtracting 0.6x from both sides yields 0.4x = $40. Dividing both sides by 0.4 gives x = $100.

Now that we know the total bill is $100, we can calculate the cost of the heartworm check, which is 60% of $100, or 0.6 \* $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: $40 + $60 = $100.

Since John brought $125 with him, the amount he leaves with is $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of its individual components. 

Let's denote the price of one apple as $a, the price of one banana as $b, and the price of one orange as $o. We are given that one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one orange costs three times as much as a banana.

Given the price of an apple, we can express the price of a banana as 2a, and the price of an orange as 3b. Since we know the price of an apple is $0.5, we can substitute this value into our expressions for the price of a banana and an orange: b = 2a = 2 * $0.5 = $1, and o = 3b = 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5b = 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12a = 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7o = 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the costs of its individual components: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color of squares and then sum them up.

Let's denote the number of red squares as R, blue squares as B, green squares as G, and white squares as W. We are given the following information:

- R = 14
- B = R + 4
- G = B + 6
- W = G - 12

Substituting the given values, we get:
- B = 14 + 4 = 18
- G = 18 + 6 = 24
- W = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we can calculate the total number of squares by summing up the number of squares of each color:
Total squares = R + B + G + W
Total squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12
Total squares = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To determine the number of additional chairs Mia's restaurant needs to accommodate the attendees, we must first calculate the total number of chairs required. Given that there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, the total number of chairs needed is the sum of the two groups.

Total chairs needed = Number of adults + Number of babies
= 42 + 15
= 57

Since the restaurant has 8 high chairs, and there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs by multiplying the number of high chairs by 5.

Number of regular chairs = 5 × 8
= 40

Now, we can find the total number of chairs available by adding the number of high chairs and regular chairs.

Total chairs available = Number of high chairs + Number of regular chairs
= 8 + 40
= 48

To determine the number of additional chairs needed, we subtract the total number of chairs available from the total number of chairs needed.

Additional chairs needed = Total chairs needed - Total chairs available
= 57 - 48
= 9

Therefore, Mia's restaurant needs 9 more chairs to accommodate the attendees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of 8-point bucks in the field, we first need to calculate the proportion of bucks among the total deer population. Given that 50% of the deer are bucks, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 50 by 100, which equals 0.5. Multiplying this proportion by the total number of deer (50) yields the number of bucks: 0.5 * 50 = 25.

Next, we need to find the proportion of bucks that are 8 points. Since 20% of the bucks are 8 points, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 20 by 100, which equals 0.2. Multiplying this proportion by the number of bucks (25) gives us the number of 8-point bucks: 0.2 * 25 = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total points collected by the class, we need to calculate the points earned by each student. 

Let's start by calculating Betty's points. Since she collected 30% more points than Adam, we can express this as:

Betty's points = Adam's points + (30% of Adam's points)
= 50 + (0.3 * 50)
= 50 + 15
= 65

Next, we need to find Tom's points. It is given that he has 30 points less than Betty. Therefore, we can express this as:

Tom's points = Betty's points - 30
= 65 - 30
= 35

Now, we are given that Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. This can be expressed as:

Martha's points = 3 * Tom's points
= 3 * 35
= 105

To find the total points collected by the class, we add the points earned by each student:

Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Martha's points
= 50 + 65 + 35 + 105
= 255

Since the minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points, we can find the points the class is missing by subtracting the total points collected from the threshold:

Points missing = Threshold - Total points
= 400 - 255
= 145

The final answer is: $\boxed{145}$"
"To determine the total number of great grand-babies at the family reunion, we can apply the concept of exponential growth. Starting with Great Grandma Jones, we have a single individual. Each of her three children contributes three children of their own, resulting in 3^2 = 9 grandchildren. Then, each of these 9 grandchildren contributes three great grand-babies, leading to 9 * 3 = 27 great grand-babies.

This can be represented using the formula for exponential growth: a^(n+1) = a^n * a, where 'a' is the growth factor (3 in this case) and 'n' is the number of generations (1 for the children, 2 for the grandchildren, and 3 for the great grand-babies).

Applying this formula, we get: 3^(1+2) = 3^3 = 27.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies at the family reunion.

The final answer is: 27"
"To determine the amount Greta has left to spend after funding her retirement account and making her car payment, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, let's calculate the amount she contributes to her retirement account. This is a straightforward application of percentage calculation, where 50% of her paycheck is allocated towards retirement savings. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Retirement Contribution = 0.5 × $2400.00
Retirement Contribution = $1200.00

Next, we need to calculate the amount she uses for her car payment. This is another percentage calculation, where 20% of her paycheck is allocated towards the car payment. The mathematical representation is:

Car Payment = 0.2 × $2400.00
Car Payment = $480.00

Now, to find the amount she has left to spend, we subtract the retirement contribution and car payment from her total paycheck:

Amount Left to Spend = Total Paycheck - (Retirement Contribution + Car Payment)
Amount Left to Spend = $2400.00 - ($1200.00 + $480.00)
Amount Left to Spend = $2400.00 - $1680.00
Amount Left to Spend = $720.00

Therefore, Greta has $720.00 left to spend after funding her retirement account and making her car payment."
"To determine the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we first need to calculate the number of pencils that remain in the box after 4 are missing. This can be done by subtracting the number of missing pencils from the total capacity of the box.

Let's denote the total capacity of the box as C and the number of missing pencils as M. We know that C = 20 and M = 4.

Number of pencils in the box = C - M
= 20 - 4
= 16

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of pencils in the box. Since a pair consists of 2 pencils, we can calculate the number of pairs by dividing the total number of pencils by 2.

Number of pairs of pencils = Number of pencils in the box / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

Therefore, the number of pairs of pencils in the box is 8.

"To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is given by the product of the number of boxes and the number of fireworks per box:

$$
\text{Number of fireworks from city display} = 15 \times 20 = 300
$$

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. This can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{40% of 300} = 0.4 \times 300 = 120
$$

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks from Hannah's backyard display. She will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard display is given by the product of the number of boxes and the number of fireworks per box:

$$
\text{Number of fireworks from backyard display} = 3 \times 5 = 15
$$

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display:

$$
\text{Total number of fireworks} = 120 + 15 = 135
$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"

"To determine the capacity of Gary's truck, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the capacity of Gissela's truck as G, Gordy's truck as H, and Gary's truck as Y.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. G = 4,000 (Gissela's truck capacity)
2. H = G + 800 (Gordy's truck capacity is 800 pounds more than Gissela's)
3. G + H + Y = 11,600 (combined capacity of all three trucks)

Substituting the value of G from equation 1 into equation 2, we get:
H = 4,000 + 800
H = 4,800

Now, we can substitute the values of G and H into equation 3:
4,000 + 4,800 + Y = 11,600

Combine like terms:
8,800 + Y = 11,600

Subtract 8,800 from both sides:
Y = 11,600 - 8,800
Y = 2,800

Therefore, the capacity of Gary's truck is 2,800 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2800}$"
"To determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of dumplings each female ate as $f$ and the number of dumplings each male ate as $m$. We are given that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so we can express this relationship as $m = f + 1$.

We also know that there are 6 females and 8 males, and each female ate 3 dumplings. Therefore, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is $6f = 6 \cdot 3 = 18$. Since each male ate 4 dumplings (as $m = f + 1$ and $f = 3$), the total number of dumplings eaten by males is $8m = 8 \cdot 4 = 32$.

The total number of dumplings eaten by all individuals is the sum of the dumplings eaten by females and males, which is $6f + 8m = 18 + 32 = 50$. Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. Given that Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2, we can express their shares as fractions of the total amount.

Let's denote Gerald's share as G and Julia's share as J. We can write the ratio as G:J = 3:2. Since the total amount is $100, we can set up the equation:

G + J = 100

We can express G and J in terms of a common multiplier, x, as follows:

G = 3x
J = 2x

Substituting these expressions into the equation, we get:

3x + 2x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Now that we have the value of x, we can find Gerald's initial amount:

G = 3x
= 3(20)
= 60

After spending $10 on a book, Gerald is left with:

Gerald's remaining amount = 60 - 10
= 50

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to establish the turtle's speed. Given that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat's speed is 15 feet/second, we can calculate the turtle's speed as follows:

Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 feet/second / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can use the formula Distance = Speed * Time to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds:

Distance = Speed of the turtle * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we can use a simple linear model. Let's denote the total amount raised as $A, the number of hours as $h$, and the amount raised per hour as $r$. We know that the firefighters have already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, so we can express this as $A = 3r$.

We are also given that their goal is to raise a total of $6300. To find the amount they need to raise per hour, we can set up the equation $3r = 2100$ and solve for $r$. Dividing both sides by 3, we get $r = \frac{2100}{3} = 700$.

Now that we know the amount raised per hour, we can find the total number of hours needed to reach their goal. The remaining amount to be raised is $6300 - 2100 = 4200$. We can set up the equation $h \cdot 700 = 4200$ to represent the situation, where $h$ is the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount.

Solving for $h$, we get $h = \frac{4200}{700} = 6$. Since they have already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours: $h_{total} = 6 + 3 = 9$.

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for a total of 9 hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we need to first calculate the percentage of water used by the city and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

Let's denote the total water used by the city as 40% of the Colorado River's total water. This can be expressed as 0.4. Since 80% of the water used by the city is utilized for industrial purposes, we can calculate the percentage used for industrial purposes as 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%.

To find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 0.4 - 0.32 = 0.08 or 8%.

Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to calculate the total number of days in the given period. Since there are 7 days in a standard week, we can find the total number of days in 2 weeks by multiplying the number of days in a week by 2.

Let's denote the number of days in a week as $w$ and the number of weeks as $n$. The total number of days in $n$ weeks is given by the expression $n \cdot w$. In this case, $n = 2$ and $w = 7$, so the total number of days is $2 \cdot 7 = 14$.

Now, we can calculate the total amount Alex charges by multiplying the number of days by her daily charge of $12. The total amount is given by the expression $14 \cdot 12 = 168$.

Therefore, the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring is $168.

The final answer is: $168"

First, let's calculate the production rate of chocolate ice cream. The factory produces 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. Therefore, the production rate of chocolate ice cream is given by:

$$\text{Production Rate}_{\text{chocolate}} = \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts/hour}.$$

Similarly, the production rate of vanilla ice cream is calculated as follows:

$$\text{Production Rate}_{\text{vanilla}} = \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour}.$$

Now, we can calculate the total quarts of each type of ice cream produced in 48 hours by multiplying the production rate by the number of hours:

$$\text{Total Quarts}_{\text{chocolate}} = \text{Production Rate}_{\text{chocolate}} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}$$

$$\text{Total Quarts}_{\text{vanilla}} = \text{Production Rate}_{\text{vanilla}} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}$$

Finally, the total quarts of ice cream produced in 48 hours is the sum of the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream:

$$\text{Total Quarts} = \text{Total Quarts}_{\text{chocolate}} + \text{Total Quarts}_{\text{vanilla}} = 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To determine Marcus' total bill, we must first calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

The cost of the croissants can be calculated as follows: 5 * $3.00 = $15.00. This is a straightforward application of the distributive property of multiplication over addition.

Similarly, the cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00, and the cost of the mini quiches is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00. The cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

To find the total cost before the discount, we sum the individual costs: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

The discount is 10% of the total cost, which can be calculated as 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00. This is a simple application of the concept of percentage.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should purchase, we can analyze the given deal as a mathematical problem. The ice cream parlor offers a ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 free"" deal, where each scoop costs $1.50. 

Let's denote the number of scoops Erin can buy as 'n'. Since the deal is based on a ratio of 2:1, we can express the total number of scoops Erin can get as 3n/2. However, this is not the only way to approach the problem. We can also consider the cost of the scoops. Since Erin has $6.00, we can set up the inequality 1.5n ≤ 6, where n is the number of scoops she can buy.

Solving the inequality, we get:

1.5n ≤ 6
n ≤ 6 / 1.5
n ≤ 4

However, this approach only accounts for the cost of the scoops and does not take into account the deal. To maximize the number of scoops Erin can get, we should consider the deal. Since Erin can get 1 free scoop for every 2 scoops she buys, we can express the total number of scoops she can get as 3n/2.

Now, let's consider the cost of the scoops. Since Erin has $6.00, we can set up the equation 1.5n + 1.5n = 6, where n is the number of scoops she buys. This equation represents the cost of the 2 scoops she buys and the 1 free scoop she gets.

Solving the equation, we get:

3n = 6
n = 2

However, this is the number of scoops Erin buys, not the total number of scoops she gets. Since she gets 1 free scoop for every 2 scoops she buys, the total number of scoops she gets is 3n/2.

Total number of scoops = 3(2) / 2
Total number of scoops = 3

However, Erin has $6.00, which is more than the cost of 3 scoops. Therefore, she can buy 2 more scoops with the remaining money.

Total number of scoops = 3 + 2
Total number of scoops = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the difference in the amount of candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of candies each consumes over this period and then subtract the difference from their initial amounts.

Let's denote the initial amount of candy each has as $I$, the daily candy consumption rate for Ginger as $G_d$, and the daily candy consumption rate for Amy as $A_d$. The time period is two weeks, which is equivalent to 14 days.

Given that Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, we have $G_d = 4$. Similarly, Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so $A_d = 3$.

The total number of candies consumed by Ginger in two weeks is $G_d \times 14 = 4 \times 14 = 56$. The total number of candies consumed by Amy in two weeks is $A_d \times 14 = 3 \times 14 = 42$.

Now, let's calculate the remaining candies for each. Ginger starts with 100 pieces and consumes 56, so she has $I - G_d \times 14 = 100 - 56 = 44$ pieces left. Similarly, Amy starts with 100 pieces and consumes 42, so she has $I - A_d \times 14 = 100 - 42 = 58$ pieces left.

To find the difference in the amount of candy Amy has compared to Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: $58 - 44 = 14$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of mosaic tiles required to cover two thirds of Mr. Boarden's 36 sq ft bathroom, we first need to calculate the area that needs to be covered.

The area to be covered is two thirds of 36 sq ft, which can be calculated as:

(2/3) * 36 = (2 * 36) / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24 sq ft

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, the total number of tiles required for 24 sq ft is:

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

The final answer is: 576"
"To determine the amount James saved by picking blueberries, we need to calculate the cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of purchasing them at the store.

The cost of picking blueberries can be calculated using the formula: initial cost + (price per pound * number of pounds). In this case, the initial cost is $20, the price per pound is $1.5, and the number of pounds picked is 30. Therefore, the cost of picking blueberries is $20 + (1.5 * 30) = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of purchasing blueberries at the store can be calculated using the formula: price per pound * number of pounds. In this case, the price per pound is $2.5, and the number of pounds is 30. Therefore, the cost of purchasing blueberries at the store is 2.5 * 30 = $75.

To find the amount James saved, we subtract the cost of picking blueberries from the cost of purchasing blueberries at the store: $75 - $65 = $10.

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking blueberries instead of purchasing them at the store.

The final answer is: $10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid for the computers, we need to first determine the new price of each computer. Given that the original price was $700 and the price increase is 10%, we can calculate the new price as follows:

Let's denote the original price as P = $700 and the price increase as a percentage of the original price, which is 10% or 0.10. The new price (P') can be calculated using the formula:

P' = P + (P * 0.10)

P' = $700 + ($700 * 0.10)
P' = $700 + $70
P' = $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid for 500 computers by multiplying the new price by the number of computers:

Total Amount = P' * Number of Computers
Total Amount = $770 * 500
Total Amount = $385,000

The final answer is: $385,000"
"To determine the total caloric content of the omelet, we must first calculate the caloric contributions from each ingredient. 

The omelet consists of 6 eggs, each with a caloric content of 75 calories. Therefore, the total caloric contribution from the eggs is 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories.

The omelet also contains 2 oz of cheese, with a caloric content of 120 calories per ounce. Consequently, the total caloric contribution from the cheese is 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories.

Lastly, the omelet contains 2 oz of ham, with a caloric content of 40 calories per ounce. Hence, the total caloric contribution from the ham is 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories.

To obtain the total caloric content of the omelet, we sum the caloric contributions from each ingredient: 450 calories (eggs) + 240 calories (cheese) + 80 calories (ham) = 770 calories.

The final answer is: $\boxed{770}$"
"To determine the change received after purchasing 6 pencils and 8 erasers, we can calculate the total cost of the items and subtract this amount from the total payment made.

The cost of each pencil is $0.50, and the cost of each eraser is $0.25. We can calculate the total cost of the pencils and erasers using the formula:

Total cost = (cost of pencils) + (cost of erasers)
= (6 * $0.50) + (8 * $0.25)
= $3 + $2
= $5

Since the total payment made was $10, the change received can be calculated as follows:

Change = Total payment - Total cost
= $10 - $5
= $5

Therefore, the change received is $5."
"To determine the number of people who accept the position at Google, we can apply the given percentages step by step.

First, we calculate the number of people who receive interviews, which is 30% of the total applicants. This can be expressed as:

Number of people who receive interviews = 0.3 * 100 = 30

Next, we find the number of people who receive a job offer, which is 20% of those who received interviews:

Number of people who receive a job offer = 0.2 * 30 = 6

Finally, we calculate the number of people who accept the position, which is one-third of those who received a job offer:

Number of people who accept the position = 6 / 3 = 2

Therefore, the number of people who accept the position is 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total amount of rice given to Goldy's cousin and brother, we need to calculate the total number of sacks given away and then multiply it by the weight of each sack.

First, we calculate the total number of sacks given away: 3 sacks (to her cousin) + 4 sacks (to her brother) = 7 sacks.

Next, we multiply the total number of sacks by the weight of each sack, which is 25 kilograms. This can be expressed as:

Total kilograms given away = 7 sacks * 25 kg/sack = 7 × 25 kg = 175 kg

Therefore, Goldy gave a total of 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother.

"To determine the difference in the number of cereal boxes purchased between this week and last week, we need to calculate the total number of boxes bought in each period. 

This week, Castle acquired 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, resulting in a total of 3 + 5 = 8 boxes.

Last week, she purchased 4 boxes of cereal.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week: 8 - 4 = 4.

Therefore, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To determine the total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of taps for both scenarios (with arms down and with arms up) and add them together.

Let's denote the number of taps per minute for each foot as follows:
- Right foot taps per minute (R) = 300
- Left foot taps per minute (L) = 250

Scenario 1: Arms down
The total number of taps per minute is the sum of the taps per minute for each foot: R + L = 300 + 250 = 550.
The total number of taps for 3 minutes is the product of the total taps per minute and the number of minutes: 550 * 3 = 1650.

Scenario 2: Arms up
The total number of taps per minute is the sum of the taps per minute for each foot: R' + L' = 200 + 200 = 400.
The total number of taps for 2 minutes is the product of the total taps per minute and the number of minutes: 400 * 2 = 800.

The total number of taps is the sum of the taps in both scenarios: 1650 + 800 = 2450.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and subtract it from the total damage it will cause to his car.

The total damage to his car is $450.

The cost of fixing the pothole includes the fine for unauthorized road maintenance, which is $120, and the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt, which is 3 × $25 = $75.

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $120 + $75 = $195.

Now, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the total damage it will cause to his car: $450 - $195 = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

The final answer is: $255"
"To determine the total number of chairs left in the restaurant, we need to calculate the difference between the initial number of chairs and the number of chairs sent for repair.

Let's denote the initial number of normal chairs as N and the initial number of baby chairs as B. We are given that N = 170 and B = 23.

The total number of chairs sent for repair is the sum of the normal chairs and baby chairs sent, which is 20 + 13 = 33.

To find the total number of chairs left, we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total initial number of chairs. The total initial number of chairs is the sum of the normal and baby chairs, which is N + B = 170 + 23 = 193.

The total number of chairs left is then given by:

Total chairs left = (N + B) - (normal chairs sent for repair + baby chairs sent for repair)
Total chairs left = (170 + 23) - (20 + 13)
Total chairs left = 193 - 33
Total chairs left = 160

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into manageable parts. Let's start by determining the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two of his friends. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can express this as a fraction of the total number of slices.

Let's denote the total number of slices as S. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 times 12, as there are 5 people in total (Bryce and 4 friends). Therefore, S = 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

The number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends can be calculated as follows:

(2/3) * S = (2/3) * 60 = 40 slices

However, this is the total number of slices eaten by 5 people, but we know that 2 of these people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:

(2/3) * 3 * 12 = 24 slices

Now, we subtract the number of slices eaten by 3 people from the total number of slices eaten by 5 people to find the number of slices eaten by the remaining 2 people:

40 slices - 24 slices = 16 slices

Now, we know that 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is:

2 * 9 = 18 slices

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:

Total number of slices = 60 slices
Total number of slices eaten = 24 slices + 16 slices + 18 slices = 58 slices
Number of slices left = 60 slices - 58 slices = 2 slices

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we first need to calculate the time taken by the dog. Given that the dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we can express this as a ratio of their respective times.

Let's denote the time taken by the cat as $t_c$ and the time taken by the dog as $t_d$. We are given that $t_c = 30$ minutes. The ratio of the time taken by the dog to the time taken by the cat is 2/3, so we can write:

$$\frac{t_d}{t_c} = \frac{2}{3}$$

Substituting the given value of $t_c$, we get:

$$\frac{t_d}{30} = \frac{2}{3}$$

Solving for $t_d$, we multiply both sides by 30:

$$t_d = \frac{2}{3} \cdot 30 = 20$$

Now that we have the times taken by both the cat and the dog, we can calculate the average time taken by both animals to eat the sausages:

$$\text{Average time} = \frac{t_c + t_d}{2} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches, we can express 8 feet as 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding 4 inches to that gives us a total length of 100 inches for one of Topher's shoes.

Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We are given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This relationship can be expressed as:

x * 9 + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation yields:

x * 9 = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us:

x = 90 / 9
x = 10

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars. We know that there are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows, and a quarter of the windows are smashed. This can be represented as:

Total windows smashed from students' cars = (1/4) × (64 × 4)
= (1/4) × 256
= 64

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows, and three-fourths of the windows are smashed. This can be represented as:

Total windows smashed from teachers' cars = (3/4) × (32 × 2)
= (3/4) × 64
= 48

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars:

Total windows smashed = 64 + 48
= 112

The final answer is: $\boxed{112}$"
"To determine the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we need to calculate the proportion of blue spools to the total number of spools. 

First, we calculate the total number of blue spools by adding the light blue and dark blue spools.

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we calculate the total number of spools by summing the light blue, dark blue, light green, and dark green spools.

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue is 40%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the number of people who voted by midday. Given that 2/5 of the 5000 people had voted by midday, we can express this as a fraction:

$$\frac{2}{5} \cdot 5000 = 2000$$

This means that 2000 people had voted by midday.

Next, we need to find the number of people who voted by 16:00. Since 2/3 of the remaining people had voted by 16:00, we first need to determine the number of people remaining after midday. This can be calculated as:

$$5000 - 2000 = 3000$$

Now, we can find the number of people who voted by 16:00:

$$\frac{2}{3} \cdot 3000 = 2000$$

Therefore, a total of 2000 people voted by 16:00.

To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we subtract the number of people who voted by 16:00 from the total number of people:

$$5000 - 2000 - 2000 = 1000$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we must first calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will consume during this period. Given that Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day, the total number of pieces he will chew in 30 days can be calculated as follows:

Total pieces of gum = 4 pieces/day * 30 days = 4 * 30 = 120 pieces

Next, we need to determine the number of packs of gum required to meet this demand. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, we can calculate the number of packs needed by dividing the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:

Number of packs = Total pieces of gum / Pieces per pack = 120 / 15

To perform this division, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 15:

Number of packs = (120 / 15) = (8)

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers required, we need to calculate the total number of s'mores needed. 

First, let's calculate the total number of s'mores required for the kids. Since 9 kids want 2 s'mores each, the total number of s'mores for kids is given by the product of the number of kids and the number of s'mores each kid wants: $9 \times 2 = 18$.

Next, we calculate the total number of s'mores required for the adults. Since 6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, the total number of s'mores for adults is simply 6.

Now, we can find the total number of s'mores required by adding the number of s'mores for kids and adults: $18 + 6 = 24$.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large s'mores, the total number of sleeves needed is given by the total number of s'mores required divided by the number of s'mores per sleeve: $\frac{24}{8} = 3$.

Given that there are 3 sleeves in a box, the total number of boxes needed is the total number of sleeves required divided by the number of sleeves per box: $\frac{3}{3} = 1$.

Therefore, the number of boxes of graham crackers required is 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote Dora's age as D, her father's age as F, and her mother's age as M.

Given that Dora's age is 15 years, we have D = 15.

We are also given that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, which can be expressed as F = 2D + 8. Substituting D = 15 into this equation yields F = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38.

Furthermore, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, which can be represented as M = F - 4. Substituting F = 38 into this equation gives M = 38 - 4 = 34.

Now, we can calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by summing their individual ages: Total combined age = D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87.

The final answer is: $\boxed{87}$"
"To determine the equitable distribution of the $20 among Greg's 3 younger siblings, we can apply the concept of division. Specifically, we will use the operation of division to allocate the total amount of money among the siblings.

The mathematical operation to find the amount each sibling receives is:

Amount per sibling = Total amount ÷ Number of siblings

Given that the total amount is $20 and the number of siblings is 3, we can calculate the amount per sibling as follows:

Amount per sibling = $20 ÷ 3
Amount per sibling = $20/3
Amount per sibling = $6.67

Therefore, each of Greg's siblings received $6.67."
"To determine the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we need to calculate the combined weight of her math, science, French, English, and history books.

Given that each math and science book weighs 2 pounds, we can express their combined weight as 2 * 2 = 4 pounds.

The French book weighs 4 pounds, and the English book weighs 3 pounds. 

The history book weighs twice as much as the English book, which is 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight by adding the weights of all the books: 4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we can start by calculating the number of votes candidate B received. Given that candidate A obtained 20% of the votes, we can express this as a decimal: 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A, which can be calculated as follows:

Let x be the number of votes candidate A received. Then, candidate B received x + 0.5x = 1.5x votes.

Since candidate A received 20 votes, we can substitute this value into the equation for candidate B's votes:

1.5x = 30

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.5:

x = 30 / 1.5
x = 20

Now that we know candidate A received 20 votes, we can calculate the number of votes candidate B received:

Candidate B received 1.5x = 1.5 * 20 = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100. Candidate A and B received a combined total of 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Candidate C received the remaining votes, which is 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

Therefore, candidate C received 50 votes.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step. We are given that Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. This implies that Beck's initial amount of apples can be represented as:

Beck's apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's apples = 100 - 23
Beck's apples = 77

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. To find Beck's new amount of apples, we add 10 to the initial amount:

Beck's new apples = 77 + 10
Beck's new apples = 87

Boris's new amount of apples can be found by subtracting the 10 apples he gave to Beck from his initial amount:

Boris's new apples = 100 - 10
Boris's new apples = 90

To determine how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's new amount from Boris's new amount:

Difference = Boris's new apples - Beck's new apples
Difference = 90 - 87
Difference = 3

Therefore, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the amount of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial amount of water.

Let's start by calculating the total amount of water used for each type of cube. For giant cubes, the amount of water used is given by the product of the number of cubes and the amount of water per cube: $3 \times 4 = 12$ ounces. Similarly, for medium cubes, the amount of water used is $7 \times 2 = 14$ ounces, and for small cubes, the amount of water used is $8 \times 0.5 = 4$ ounces.

Now, we can find the total amount of water used by adding the amounts used for each type of cube: $12 + 14 + 4 = 30$ ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water to find the amount of water left: $32 - 30 = 2$ ounces.

"Given the scenario, we can establish a relationship between the number of books each individual possesses. Let's denote the number of books Steven has as S, the number of books Alice has as A, and the number of books Clara has as C.

From the information provided, we know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven, which can be expressed as C = 2S. We are also given that Clara has 20 books, so we can solve for S:

C = 2S
20 = 2S
S = 20 / 2
S = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can determine the number of books Alice has. It is stated that Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so we can express this as A = S + 6. Substituting the value of S, we get:

A = S + 6
A = 10 + 6
A = 16

To find the difference in the number of books between Clara and Alice, we can subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

C - A = 20 - 16
C - A = 4

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and a half-gallon jar costs $2 less, we can express the cost of a half-gallon jar as $5 - $2 = $3. 

To calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars, we can use the following equation:

Total Cost = (Cost of 10-gallon jars) + (Cost of 16 half-gallon jars)
Total Cost = (10 * $5) + (16 * $3)
Total Cost = $50 + $48
Total Cost = $98

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is $98.

The final answer is: $98"
"Given a class of 50 students with diverse hobbies, we can apply set theory to determine the number of students who enjoy playing video games. Let's denote the sets as follows:

- B = {students who like to bake}
- G = {students who like to play video games}
- M = {students who like to play music}
- Bb = {students who like to play basketball}

We are given that |B| = 10, |Bb| = 5, and |M| = 2|Bb| = 10.

The total number of students who like to either play video games or music is the union of sets G and M, which can be expressed as |G ∪ M| = |G| + |M| - |G ∩ M|. However, since we do not have information about the intersection of G and M, we will assume that the intersection is empty for the sake of this problem, which is a reasonable assumption given the lack of information.

We can now find the total number of students who like to either play video games or music by subtracting the number of students who like to bake and play basketball from the total number of students:

|G ∪ M| = |B ∪ Bb ∪ G ∪ M| - |B ∪ Bb|
= |B ∪ Bb| + |G ∪ M| - |B ∪ Bb|
= 50 - (|B| + |Bb|)
= 50 - (10 + 5)
= 35

Since |M| = 10, we can find |G| by subtracting |M| from |G ∪ M|:

|G| = |G ∪ M| - |M|
= 35 - 10
= 25

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the number of birds that were scared away, we can calculate 1/3 of the initial number of birds, which is 12.

$$\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = \frac{12}{3} = 4$$

So, 4 birds were scared away. 

Now, we subtract 4 from the initial number of birds: 
$$12 - 4 = 8$$

Then, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. 
$$8 + 20 = 28$$

Therefore, the final number of birds in the backyard is 28."
"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can start by recognizing that the total number of students in both classes is 80. Given that each class has an equal number of students, we can calculate the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2.

Let's denote the number of students in each class as x. Therefore, we have:

x + x = 80

Combine like terms:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Now that we know each class has 40 students, we can find the number of girls in each class. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 40 by 100 and multiplying by 40:

0.4 * 40 = 16

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

40 - 16 = 24

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of cake slices remaining on the plate, we can break down the sequence of events into a series of mathematical operations.

Initially, Mara had 2 slices on the plate. She then added 3 slices, resulting in a total of 2 + 3 = 5 slices.

Next, Mara tripled the number of slices, which can be represented as 5 × 3 = 15 slices.

Subsequently, she consumed 2 slices, leaving her with 15 - 2 = 13 slices.

Finally, her friend stole 5 slices, reducing the total to 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

Therefore, the number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8."
"To determine the number of animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to calculate the total number of animals and then divide by the number of days in a week.

The total number of animals can be calculated by adding the number of dogs, cats, birds, and horses that need grooming:

Total number of animals = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of birds + Number of horses
= 8 + 5 + 3 + 12
= 28

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of animals by 7 to find the average number of animals groomed per day:

Average number of animals groomed per day = Total number of animals / Number of days in a week
= 28 / 7
= 4

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the profit made by Mark, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue from the packs of old magic cards.

The total cost is the cost of the packs: 3 packs * $1800 = $5400.

The total revenue is the sum of the value of the cards: 
- 1 card worth $4000
- 1 card worth $1000
- 30 cards worth an average of $50 each: 30 * $50 = $1500
Total revenue = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"To determine the cost savings of choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference between them.

Let's denote the number of adults as A and the number of children as C. In this case, A = 2 and C = 2.

The cost function for the first amusement park can be represented as:
C1 = 26A + 12C
C1 = 26(2) + 12(2)
C1 = 52 + 24
C1 = 76

The cost function for the second amusement park can be represented as:
C2 = 14A + 10C
C2 = 14(2) + 10(2)
C2 = 28 + 20
C2 = 48

Now, we can find the difference in cost between the two amusement parks:
ΔC = C1 - C2
ΔC = 76 - 48
ΔC = 28

Therefore, the family will be able to save $28 by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

The final answer is: $28"
"To determine the weekly savings of the tomato vendor, we can calculate the daily savings and then multiply it by 7.

Let's denote the original price per tomato as $0.5 and the new price per tomato as $0.4. The daily savings can be calculated as follows:

Daily savings = (500 tomatoes/day * $0.5/tomato) - (500 tomatoes/day * $0.4/tomato)
Daily savings = $250 - $200
Daily savings = $50

Now, to find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7:

Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7
Weekly savings = $50 * 7
Weekly savings = $350

Therefore, the tomato vendor saves $350 per week by switching to the new vendor.

The final answer is: $350"
"Given the problem, we can establish a relationship between the number of marbles each individual possesses. Let's denote the number of marbles Sean has as S, the number of marbles Carl has as C, and the number of marbles Cal has as Ca.

We are given that Sean has 56 marbles, so S = 56. We also know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, which can be expressed as S = Ca/2. Substituting the value of S, we get 56 = Ca/2, and solving for Ca yields Ca = 112.

Furthermore, we are told that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, which can be written as C = 4S. Substituting the value of S, we get C = 4(56) = 224.

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together: C + Ca = 224 + 112 = 336.

The final answer is: $\boxed{336}$"
"To determine the number of additional groups required, we first need to calculate the total number of students per group. Given that 54 students are to be separated into six groups of equal size, we can divide the total number of students by the number of groups.

Students per group = Total students / Number of groups
Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

Now, we are informed that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students required, we multiply the number of groups by the students per group.

Total students required = Number of groups * Students per group
Total students required = 12 * 9
Total students required = 108

Since we already have 54 students, we need to find the number of additional students required to form 12 groups.

Additional students required = Total students required - Total students available
Additional students required = 108 - 54
Additional students required = 54

To find the number of additional groups required, we divide the additional students required by the students per group.

Additional groups required = Additional students required / Students per group
Additional groups required = 54 / 9
Additional groups required = 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total number of chairs rented by Candy in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the average daily chair rentals and then multiply it by the total number of days in two months.

First, let's find the average daily chair rentals. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week. 

- Weekday rentals: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekend rentals: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total weekly rentals: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs
- Average daily rentals: 500 chairs/week / 7 days/week = 500/7 ≈ 71.43 chairs/day

Now, let's calculate the total number of days in two 4-week months. Since a month is approximately 4 weeks, two months would be 8 weeks. However, to account for the varying number of days in a month, we'll use the exact number of days in two months. 

- February has 28 days, and any other month has at least 30 days. Therefore, two months would have at least 28 + 30 = 58 days. However, considering the possibility of a 31-day month, we'll use 60 days as a more conservative estimate.

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs rented in two months:
- Total chairs rented in two months: 71.43 chairs/day * 60 days ≈ 4285.8 chairs

The final answer is: 4286"
"To determine the number of bananas Gunther had at the end, we can break down the sequence of events.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

When Arnold stole half of the bananas, the number of bananas left is 48 - (48/2) = 48 - 24 = 24.

Gunther then added 25 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 24 + 25 = 49.

Subsequently, Arnold stole 12 bananas, leaving 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

Finally, Gunther added 6 bananas, resulting in a total of 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, the final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43."
"To determine the annual electricity cost per roommate, we can employ a straightforward division of the total monthly bill by the number of roommates, followed by a multiplication by the number of months in a year.

Given that the monthly electricity bill is $100 and there are 4 roommates, we can calculate the monthly share as follows:

$100 ÷ 4 = $25 per roommate per month

To find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly share by 12:

$25 × 12 = $300 per roommate per year

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to calculate the initial number of items sent and then subtract the number of broken items.

The initial number of glasses sent is 8 dozen, which is equivalent to 8 * 12 = 96 glasses. Similarly, the initial number of plates sent is 4 dozen, which is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

Now, let's calculate the number of glasses and plates left after 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken, respectively.

Glasses left = Initial number of glasses - Number of broken glasses
= 96 - 10
= 86

Plates left = Initial number of plates - Number of broken plates
= 48 - 6
= 42

Therefore, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.

The final answer is: 
Glasses: 86

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of small buttons Lorraine has as $S$ and the number of large buttons as $L$. Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. We can express the value of these stickers in terms of buttons.

1. Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 0.9 * 30 = 27 small buttons from trading small stickers. This means she has 27 small buttons and 40 large stickers left.

2. Now, let's consider the value of her large stickers. Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, we can express the value of her large stickers in terms of small buttons. If she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons, she gets 0.5 * 40 = 20 large buttons. This means she has 20 large buttons and 20 large stickers left.

3. The remaining large stickers can be traded for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

4. Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine has. She has 27 small buttons, 20 large buttons, and 60 small buttons from trading large stickers. Therefore, the total number of buttons she has is 27 + 20 + 60 = 107.

The final answer is: $\boxed{107}$"

"To determine the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since there are twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

$$\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{33}{3}$$

x = 11

Since x is the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x:

2x = 2(11)
= 22

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total number of shirts ordered, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of students needing each size as follows: x (extra-small), y (small), z (medium), w (large), and v (extra-large).

From the problem statement, we have the following relationships:

1. x = 11 (given)
2. y = 2x = 2(11) = 22
3. z = y - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18
4. w = z / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
5. v = w + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, we can calculate the total number of shirts ordered by summing the number of students for each size:

Total shirts = x + y + z + w + v
= 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15
= 75

Therefore, Krissa ordered a total of 75 shirts for the field trip.

"To calculate the final price after a 5% discount on an item marked at $140, we can apply the formula for calculating the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as a percentage of the original price, which can be expressed as:

Discount = Original Price * (Discount Percentage / 100)

Substituting the given values, we get:

Discount = $140 * (5 / 100)
Discount = $140 * 0.05
Discount = $7

Now, to find the final price, we subtract the discount from the original price:

Final Price = Original Price - Discount
Final Price = $140 - $7
Final Price = $133

Therefore, the final price after the 5% discount is $133.

The final answer is: $133"
"To determine the total duration of the 20 playlists, we can apply the concept of multiplication to find the total number of hours.

Let's denote the number of songs in each playlist as S, the number of playlists as P, and the duration of each song in hours as D. We are given the following values:

S = 300 songs/playlist
P = 20 playlists
D = 10 hours/song

The total number of songs across all playlists is the product of the number of songs in each playlist and the number of playlists:
Total songs = S × P = 300 × 20 = 6000 songs

Now, to find the total duration of the playlists, we multiply the total number of songs by the duration of each song:
Total duration = Total songs × D = 6000 × 10 = 60000 hours

Therefore, the total duration of the 20 playlists is 60000 hours."
"To determine the number of people who think horse #12 will win the big race, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win. This is given as 20% of the total number of people, which is 50. We can express this as a decimal and multiply it by the total number of people:

0.20 \* 50 = 10 people

Next, we find the number of people who do not think horse #2 will win, which is the remaining 80% of the total number of people. This can be calculated as:

50 - 10 = 40 people

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #7 will win, which is 60% of the remaining 40 people. We can express this as:

0.60 \* 40 = 24 people

Finally, we can find the number of people who think horse #12 will win by subtracting the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:

40 - 24 = 16 people

Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 16.

"Given that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians and one third of the Pomeranians are girls, with a total of 6 Pomeranian girls, we can deduce the total number of Pomeranians and subsequently the total number of puppies.

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P and the total number of puppies as N. From the given information, we have:

1. Pomeranians constitute 2/3 of the total puppies, so we can express this as P = (2/3)N.
2. One third of the Pomeranians are girls, and we are given that this number is 6. Therefore, (1/3)P = 6.

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can solve the equation (1/3)P = 6 by multiplying both sides by 3:

P = 6 * 3
P = 18

Now that we know the total number of Pomeranians is 18, we can substitute this value into the equation P = (2/3)N to find the total number of puppies:

18 = (2/3)N

To solve for N, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

N = 18 * (3/2)
N = 27

Therefore, Jana has a total of 27 puppies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the amount Jayden needs to purchase the camera, we must first calculate the total amount of money he has after receiving his sister's allowance. 

Jayden initially possesses $70. His sister, Ava, contributes half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. Therefore, Jayden's total funds become $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera's cost is $200. To find the remaining amount Jayden needs, we subtract the total funds from the camera's cost: $200 - $115 = $85.

Thus, Jayden requires an additional $85 to purchase the camera.

"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x.

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can write the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"

"To determine the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we first need to establish the number of books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, and Ezra read 300 books, we can calculate Ahmed's total as follows:

Let A represent the number of books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can express this relationship as:

2A = 300

To solve for A, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

A = 300 / 2
A = 150

Now that we know Ahmed read 150 books, we can calculate the total number of books Ezra will read after deciding to read 150 more. Ezra initially read 300 books, and then added 150 more, resulting in a total of:

Ezra's total books = 300 + 150
Ezra's total books = 450

To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we add their individual totals:

Total books read by both = Ahmed's total + Ezra's total
Total books read by both = 150 + 450
Total books read by both = 600

"To determine the optimal selling price for each ear of corn, we must first calculate the revenue generated from the sale of the eggplants. Given that Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, the total revenue from eggplant sales can be calculated as follows:

Revenue from eggplants = Number of eggplants sold × Price per eggplant
= 20 × $3
= $60

Since Bennet aims to achieve a total revenue of $135, the remaining revenue required from corn sales can be calculated as follows:

Remaining revenue from corn sales = Total desired revenue - Revenue from eggplant sales
= $135 - $60
= $75

With 25 ears of corn available for sale, the selling price per ear of corn can be determined by dividing the remaining revenue by the number of ears:

Selling price per ear of corn = Remaining revenue from corn sales ÷ Number of ears of corn
= $75 ÷ 25
= $3

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3 to achieve his desired total revenue of $135.

The final answer is: $3"

First, we need to calculate the total time available for her activities. Given that she has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, the total time available is:

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Next, we need to calculate the time spent reading and playing video games. We are given that she reads for 3 hours. The time spent playing video games is 1/3 of the remaining time, which is calculated as follows:

Remaining time = Total time available - Time spent reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Now, we can calculate the time spent playing soccer by subtracting the time spent reading and playing video games from the total time available:

Time spent playing soccer = Total time available - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
= 12 - 3 - 3
= 6 hours

To find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer, we can use the following formula:

Percentage = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
= (6 / 12) * 100
= 50%

Therefore, the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer is 50%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of pencils Anthony kept, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

Initially, Anthony had 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which can be calculated as follows:

50 - (1/2 * 50) = 50 - 25 = 25

This leaves Anthony with 25 pencils. Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find 3/5 of 25, we can multiply 25 by 3/5:

25 * (3/5) = (25 * 3) / 5 = 75 / 5 = 15

Now, we subtract the number of pencils given to Charlie from the remaining pencils:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

The time it takes to drive to the museum can be calculated using the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Given that the distance to the museum is 150 miles and Jack's speed is 75 mph, we can substitute these values into the formula:

Time = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since the distance to the museum is the same as the distance back home, the time it takes to drive back home is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total time spent driving is:

Total time driving = Time to drive to the museum + Time to drive back home = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

The time Jack spends at the museum is given as 6 hours. To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we add the total time driving and the time spent at the museum:

Total time Jack is gone from home = Total time driving + Time at the museum = 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of wheels left after assembling the toys, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles, and then subtract this total from the initial number of wheels in the box.

First, let's calculate the number of wheels needed for the cars. Since each car requires 4 wheels, we can find the total number of wheels needed for the 57 cars by multiplying the number of cars by the number of wheels per car:

$$\text{Wheels for cars} = 57 \times 4 = 228$$

Next, we calculate the number of wheels needed for the motorcycles. Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels, so we multiply the number of motorcycles by the number of wheels per motorcycle:

$$\text{Wheels for motorcycles} = 73 \times 2 = 146$$

Now, we add the number of wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:

$$\text{Total wheels needed} = \text{Wheels for cars} + \text{Wheels for motorcycles} = 228 + 146 = 374$$

Finally, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the initial number of wheels in the box to find the number of wheels left:

$$\text{Wheels left} = 650 - 374 = 276$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{276}$"
"To calculate the final price after a 20% discount on a laptop priced at $1000, we can apply the formula for calculating the discount amount:

Discount amount = Original price * (Discount percentage / 100)

Substituting the given values, we get:

Discount amount = $1000 * (20 / 100)
Discount amount = $1000 * 0.20
Discount amount = $200

Now, to find the final price, we subtract the discount amount from the original price:

Final price = Original price - Discount amount
Final price = $1000 - $200
Final price = $800

Therefore, the final price after the 20% discount is $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 600 = 200$ movies in series.

Since Mike can get these movies for $6 each, the cost of the movies in series is $200 \cdot 6 = 1200$ dollars.

Next, let's find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies: $600 - 200 = 400$ movies.

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we can express this as a decimal: $0.4 \cdot 400 = 160$ older movies.

The cost of the older movies is $160 \cdot 5 = 800$ dollars.

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies: $400 - 160 = 240$ normal movies.

The cost of the normal movies is $240 \cdot 10 = 2400$ dollars.

Now, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost: $1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400$ dollars.

The final answer is: $4400"
"To determine the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we can calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum the individual costs.

The cost of peaches is calculated as the product of the weight of peaches picked (6 pounds) and the price per pound ($2.00), which yields $12.00. Similarly, the cost of plums is the product of the weight of plums picked (8 pounds) and the price per pound ($1.00), resulting in $8.00. Lastly, the cost of apricots is the product of the weight of apricots picked (6 pounds) and the price per pound ($3.00), giving us $18.00.

To find the total cost, we add the individual costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To determine the distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the speed at which they hiked. Given that their driving speed was 50 miles per hour, we can find the hiking speed by subtracting 5 miles per hour from half of their driving speed. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is $25 - 5 = 20$ miles per hour.

Now, let's find the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at a speed of 50 miles per hour. The distance they drove is given by the formula $d = rt$, where $d$ is the distance, $r$ is the rate (or speed), and $t$ is the time. Therefore, the distance they drove is $d = 50 \cdot 6 = 300$ miles.

Next, let's find the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour. Using the same formula, the distance they hiked is $d = 20 \cdot 1.5 = 30$ miles.

Now, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked to find the total distance to their vacation spot. The total distance is $300 + 30 = 330$ miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{330}$"
"To determine the difference in the scores of Ava and Emma, we need to establish a system to calculate their scores based on the given conditions.

Let's denote Emma's score as $E$ and Ava's score as $A$. We are given that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, collects 3 more berries, and finishes the level 4 seconds slower.

The score for each enemy jumped is 10 points, the score for each berry collected is 5 points, and the score for each second left on the timer is 30 points.

We can express Ava's score as the sum of her enemy score, berry score, and timer score:

$$A = (E + 8) \cdot 10 + (E + 3) \cdot 5 + (60 - (E + 4)) \cdot 30$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$A = 10E + 80 + 5E + 15 + 30(56 - E)$$

$$A = 15E + 95 + 1680 - 30E$$

$$A = -15E + 1775$$

Emma's score, on the other hand, is simply the sum of her enemy score, berry score, and timer score:

$$E = E \cdot 10 + E \cdot 5 + 60 \cdot 30$$

$$E = 15E + 1800$$

Subtracting Emma's score from Ava's score, we get:

$$A - E = (-15E + 1775) - (15E + 1800)$$

$$A - E = -30$$

The difference in their scores is 30 points, with Ava's score being lower than Emma's.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use basic algebraic principles. Let's denote the cost of each of the other two pizzas as x. Since two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

We know that the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. Therefore, the total cost of the other two pizzas can be represented as 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can set up the equation 2x = 4, where x is the cost of each of the other two pizzas.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

2x / 2 = 4 / 2
x = 2

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas costs 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. This can be represented as 3 * 5 = 15. 

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is the sum of the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days, which is 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying W white fish and O orange fish, he had 3 + O orange fish and 4 + W white fish. Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + O = 2(4 + W)

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so we can set up another equation:

W + O = 17

We can solve the first equation for O:

O = 2(4 + W) - 3
O = 8 + 2W - 3
O = 5 + 2W

Now we can substitute this expression for O into the second equation:

W + 5 + 2W = 17

Combine like terms:

3W + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3W = 12

Divide both sides by 3:

W = 4

Therefore, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car, we must first calculate the total distance traveled in a week. Given that the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, and he commutes to and from work, the daily distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Since Andy works from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Next, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week using the car's fuel efficiency, which is 10 miles per gallon (MPG). The fuel consumption can be calculated as follows:

Fuel consumption (gallons) = Total distance (miles) / Fuel efficiency (MPG)
Fuel consumption (gallons) = 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week

Now, we can calculate the total cost per week by multiplying the fuel consumption by the price of regular gas, which is $3/gallon:

Total cost per week = Fuel consumption (gallons) * Price per gallon
Total cost per week = 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week

Therefore, the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car is $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the quarters. Since Carrie was given 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, the total value of the quarters is given by the product of the number of quarters and the value of each quarter:

$$140 \times 0.25 = 35$$

So, the value of the quarters is $35.

Next, let's calculate the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and each twenty is worth $20. Since she spent 3/5 of the twenties, the amount she spent is given by the product of the number of twenties and the fraction of twenties she spent:

$$10 \times \frac{3}{5} \times 20 = 120$$

So, the value of the twenties she spent is $120.

Now, we can find the total amount of money she spent by adding the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties:

$$35 + 120 = 155$$

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch is $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To determine the total number of fruits that Ricardo can obtain from his garden, we need to calculate the yield of each type of plant and then sum the results.

Let's denote the number of tomato plants as T and the number of eggplant plants as E. We are given that T = 5 and E = 8.

The yield of each tomato plant is 22 fruits, and the yield of each eggplant plant is 4 fruits. Therefore, the total yield of tomatoes can be calculated as:

T × 22 = 5 × 22 = 110

Similarly, the total yield of eggplants can be calculated as:

E × 4 = 8 × 4 = 32

To find the total number of fruits, we add the yields of tomatoes and eggplants:

Total fruits = T × 22 + E × 4
= 110 + 32
= 142

The final answer is: 142"
"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we can first calculate the total proportion of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. Given that one-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs, we can express this as fractions of the total number of TVs sold.

Let's denote the total number of TVs sold as $T$. The proportion of smart TVs is $\frac{1}{4}T$ and the proportion of analog TVs is $\frac{1}{8}T$. 

We are given that the total number of TVs sold is 40, so we can substitute $T = 40$ into the expressions for the proportions of smart and analog TVs:

The number of smart TVs sold is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 40 = 10$.
The number of analog TVs sold is $\frac{1}{8} \cdot 40 = 5$.

The total number of smart and analog TVs sold is $10 + 5 = 15$.

Since the remaining TVs are OLED, we can find the number of OLED TVs by subtracting the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold:

$T - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25$

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the amount of money John is missing for the school trip, we need to calculate the remaining cost after the school's contribution. The total cost of the trip is $300, and the school will cover half of this amount.

Let's denote the school's contribution as S and the total cost of the trip as T. We know that S = T/2. Substituting the given value, we get:

S = $300/2
S = $150

Now, we need to find the amount John is missing, which is the difference between the total cost and the school's contribution. Let's denote this as M. We can express M as:

M = T - S
M = $300 - $150
M = $150

Therefore, John is missing $150 for the school trip.

The final answer is: $150"
"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we must first calculate the temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point.

Given that the temperature during the day is 45 degrees and it's 33 degrees colder during the night, the nighttime temperature is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

The temperature difference between the freezing point (32 degrees) and the nighttime temperature is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can calculate the number of logs needed as follows:

$$\text{Number of logs} = \frac{\text{Temperature difference}}{\text{Heat per log}} = \frac{20}{5} = 4$$

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into manageable steps. 

First, we need to determine the number of groups formed with 9 people each. This can be calculated using the formula for division:

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we need to find the number of groups that brought back seashells. Since 3/5 of the groups did so, we can calculate this as follows:

Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we can calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups. Each group brought back 2 seashells, so we can multiply the number of groups that brought back seashells by the number of seashells per group:

Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of people on the train after the two stops, we can apply a simple arithmetic operation. Initially, there are 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people disembark, resulting in a reduction of 47 from the initial count. This can be represented as:

172 - 47 = 125

Subsequently, 13 individuals board the train, increasing the count by 13. This can be represented as:

125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people exit the train, leading to a decrease of 38 from the previous count. This can be represented as:

138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, the number of people on the train after the two stops is 100.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we can employ a straightforward calculation based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of bottle caps Damien finds per day as $c$, the value of each bottle cap as $v$, and the number of days in the month as $d$. Given that Damien finds 10 bottle caps per day and each cap is worth $0.25, we can express the daily earnings as $c \cdot v = 10 \cdot 0.25 = 2.50$ dollars.

To find the total earnings for the month, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in the month: $2.50 \cdot d = 2.50 \cdot 30 = 75$ dollars.

Therefore, Damien's total earnings for the month are $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours.

Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For 8 hours, her earnings can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Regular Earnings} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Number of Hours} = 20 \times 8 = 160
$$

For the additional 3 hours, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. This can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Overtime Rate} = 1.5 \times \text{Hourly Rate} = 1.5 \times 20 = 30
$$

For 3 hours, her overtime earnings are:

$$
\text{Overtime Earnings} = \text{Overtime Rate} \times \text{Number of Hours} = 30 \times 3 = 90
$$

Her total earnings for the day are the sum of her regular earnings and overtime earnings:

$$
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Regular Earnings} + \text{Overtime Earnings} = 160 + 90 = 250

"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we note that the zookeeper has counted 12 female lions. Since the number of male lions is half that of the female lions, we can calculate the number of male lions by dividing the number of female lions by 2: $\frac{12}{2} = 6$ male lions.

Additionally, we are informed that there are 14 lion cubs in the enclosure.

To find the total number of lions, we can add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs: $12 + 6 + 14 = 32$.

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To determine the amount of money Mike will have left over after purchasing the discounted jeans, we can apply the concept of percentage discount. The original price of the jeans is $40, and the discount is 25% off.

First, we calculate the discount amount:
Discount = 25% of $40
Discount = 0.25 × $40
Discount = $10

Next, we find the price after the discount:
Price after discount = Original price - Discount
Price after discount = $40 - $10
Price after discount = $30

Now, we can calculate the amount of money Mike will have left over after paying with a $50 bill:
Money left over = $50 - $30
Money left over = $20

The final numerical answer is: $20"
"To determine the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total salary for each month, then multiply it by 3.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees can be calculated using the formula for an arithmetic series:

Total employees = Initial employees + (Number of months * Number of new employees per month)
Total employees = 200 + (3 * 20)
Total employees = 200 + 60
Total employees = 260

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee:
Total salary per month = Number of employees * Salary per employee
Total salary per month = 260 * $4000
Total salary per month = $1,040,000

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
Total amount paid = Total salary per month * Number of months
Total amount paid = $1,040,000 * 3
Total amount paid = $3,120,000

The final answer is: $3,120,000"
"To determine the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the cumulative duration of the songs they plan to sing. Given that ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long and ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long, we can calculate the total caroling time as follows:

Let's denote the time for ""Deck the Halls"" as $D = 150$ seconds and the time for ""Jingle Bells"" as $J = 240$ seconds. Since the choir plans to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice, we can express the total time for this song as $2D = 2 \times 150 = 300$ seconds.

The total caroling time can be calculated by adding the time for ""Deck the Halls"" (sung twice) and the time for ""Jingle Bells"":

Total caroling time = $2D + J = 300 + 240 = 540$ seconds

Therefore, the choir will be caroling for a total of 540 seconds.

"To determine the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Initially, Billy's hourly wage is $10. After a 2-month period, he receives a raise of $0.50 per hour, resulting in a new hourly wage of $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. Following another year, he receives a raise of $1.00 per hour, increasing his hourly wage to $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

"To determine the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we first need to calculate Nikita's score. Since Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Nikita's score = (1/2) * Pierson's score + 11

Given that Pierson scored 278 points, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Nikita's score = (1/2) * 278 + 11

To solve for Nikita's score, we first calculate half of Pierson's score:

(1/2) * 278 = 139

Then, we add 11 to this result:

Nikita's score = 139 + 11 = 150

Now that we have both scores, we can find the total points scored by adding Pierson's and Nikita's scores:

Total points = Pierson's score + Nikita's score
= 278 + 150
= 428

The final answer is: 428"
"To determine the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by both students and teachers.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students. Since each student plants 1 tree, we can find the total number of trees planted by students by multiplying the total number of students by 1.

Let's start by finding the total number of students. We know that there are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. Therefore, the total number of students is:

Total students = Number of classes × Average number of students per class
Total students = 40 × 25
Total students = 1000

Now, we can find the total number of trees planted by students by multiplying the total number of students by 1:

Total trees planted by students = Total students × 1
Total trees planted by students = 1000 × 1
Total trees planted by students = 1000

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers. Since each teacher plants 2 trees, we can find the total number of trees planted by teachers by multiplying the total number of teachers by 2.

We know that there are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class. Therefore, the total number of teachers is:

Total teachers = Number of classes × Average number of teachers per class
Total teachers = 40 × 3
Total teachers = 120

Now, we can find the total number of trees planted by teachers by multiplying the total number of teachers by 2:

Total trees planted by teachers = Total teachers × 2
Total trees planted by teachers = 120 × 2
Total trees planted by teachers = 240

Finally, we can find the total number of trees planted by adding the total number of trees planted by students and teachers:

Total trees planted = Total trees planted by students + Total trees planted by teachers
Total trees planted = 1000 + 240
Total trees planted = 1240

"To determine the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has and then calculate the number of stuffed goats required to make up 30% of the total.

Let's start by finding the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs)
Total number of stuffed animals = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals:

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14
= 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30%, so we will round to the nearest whole number that will make the percentage 30% or more.

To find the total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats, we can set up the equation:

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

However, this equation is not necessary. We can simply divide 30 by 0.3 to find the total number of stuffed animals required:

(14 + x) = 100

However, this is not the correct equation. We need to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

Let's try a different approach. We can set up the equation as follows:

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3:

14 + x = 100

However, this is not the correct equation. We need to set up the equation as follows:

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3:

14 + x = 100

However, this is not the correct equation. We need to set up the equation as follows:

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

"To determine the number of hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we can break down her playing schedule into two distinct periods: the first 2 weeks and the subsequent week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for half an hour every day. Since there are 14 days in a 2-week period, the total hours played during this period can be calculated as follows:

$$\text{Hours played in 2 weeks} = 14 \times 0.5 = 7 \text{ hours}$$

In the subsequent week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day. With 7 days in a week, the total hours played during this period can be calculated as follows:

$$\text{Hours played in 1 week} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ hours}$$

To find the total hours Kris has played, we add the hours played in the two periods:

$$\text{Total hours played} = 7 + 14 = 21 \text{ hours}$$

Now, to determine the number of hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we subtract the total hours played from the target hours:

$$\text{Hours still needed} = 30 - 21 = 9 \text{ hours}$$

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we can utilize the concept of relative motion. Since the second car is traveling at a higher speed, it will be moving away from the first car.

Let's denote the initial position of the first car as x1 and the initial position of the second car as x2. Since the first car is traveling at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, its position after 2 hours can be represented as x1 + 60 * 2. Similarly, the position of the second car after 2 hours can be represented as x2 + 70 * 2.

The distance between the two cars after 2 hours is the difference between their positions, which can be calculated as:

|x2 + 70 * 2 - (x1 + 60 * 2)|

Since the initial positions of the cars are not provided, we can assume that the first car is at the origin (0 miles) for simplicity. Therefore, the equation becomes:

|x2 + 140 - (0 + 120)| = |x2 + 20|

However, we are interested in the distance between the two cars, which is a scalar quantity. Since the direction of the distance is not specified, we can remove the absolute value sign and consider the distance as the difference between the positions of the two cars.

The distance between the two cars after 2 hours is 20 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total cost of the ring, we need to calculate the premium and add it to the cost of the diamond and gold. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold.

Let's denote the cost of the diamond as $D = $600 and the cost of the gold as $G = $300. The total cost of the diamond and gold is $D + $G = $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost, which can be expressed as 0.3($D + $G) = 0.3($900) = $270.

To find the total cost, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold: $900 + $270 = $1170.

Therefore, the total amount James paid for the ring is $1170."
"To determine the overall pass rate of Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of fourth-graders, which is 40/100. Therefore, the pass rate for fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460

Next, let's find the total number of students:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
$\frac{460}{1000} \times 100 = 46\%$

Therefore, the overall pass rate of Herbert Hoover Elementary School is 46%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{46}$"
"To determine the maximum length of the mosaic, we first need to calculate the total number of square inches that can be covered with the available glass chips. Given that each square inch requires 12 glass chips, and Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, each containing 72 chips, we can calculate the total number of chips as follows:

Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips

Next, we can find the total number of square inches that can be covered with the available chips by dividing the total number of chips by the number of chips required per square inch:

Total square inches = Total chips / Chips per square inch
= 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch
= 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (length * width) to find the length of the mosaic. We know the area (12 square inches) and the height (3 inches), so we can rearrange the formula to solve for the length:

Area = Length * Width
12 = Length * 3
Length = Area / Width
= 12 / 3
= 4 inches

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the initial amount of tea at the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and then add it to the remaining amount.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students. Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is 4 × 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

Next, 16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is 16 × 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is the sum of the tea consumed by both groups of students, which is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea consumed to gallons by dividing by 4: 38 ÷ 4 = 9.5 gallons.

Now, we know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. To find the initial amount of tea at the party, we need to add the amount of tea consumed to the amount of tea left. 

Initial amount of tea = 38 quarts (tea consumed) + 10 quarts (tea left) = 48 quarts.

Converting this to gallons, we get: 48 ÷ 4 = 12 gallons.

Therefore, the initial amount of tea at the party was 12 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of candies Dale ordered as x. We know that he initially ordered 100 candies, so x = 100.

Dale sold 150 candies, which means he had 100 - 150 = -50 candies left. However, this is not possible since you cannot have a negative number of candies. This indicates that Dale must have ordered more candies to replace the ones he sold.

Let's denote the number of additional candies Dale ordered as y. We know that he ordered 100 more candies, so y = 100.

The total number of candies Dale has now is the sum of the initial candies and the additional candies: x + y = 100 + 100 = 200.

Since he sold 150 candies, the number of candies he still needs to sell is the total number of candies he has minus the number of candies he sold: 200 - 150 = 50.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we can model the growth of the student population using exponential growth. The initial number of students is 10, and the growth factor is 2, representing a doubling of the population each month.

We can express this growth using the formula for exponential growth:

N(t) = N0 \* (2)^t

where N(t) is the number of students at time t (in months), N0 is the initial number of students (10), and t is the time in months.

We want to find the number of additional students by the end of May, which is 5 months after the initial time point (January). Plugging in the values, we get:

N(5) = 10 \* (2)^5
N(5) = 10 \* 32
N(5) = 320

The number of students at the end of May is 320. To find the number of additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from this value:

Additional students = N(5) - N0
Additional students = 320 - 10
Additional students = 310

The final answer is: 310"
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we can utilize a straightforward mathematical approach. Given that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and earns a total of $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed.

Let's denote the total number of branches as B. The total earnings can be expressed as the product of the cost per branch and the total number of branches:

Total earnings = Cost per branch × Total branches
$105 = $0.25 × B

To find the total number of branches, we can divide both sides of the equation by the cost per branch:

B = Total earnings / Cost per branch
B = $105 / $0.25
B = 420

Since Felix worked for 5 days, we can calculate the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by the number of days:

Average branches per day = Total branches / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the total number of petals in the vase, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtracting the petals that were lost.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

1. For the 3 flowers with 5 petals each, the total number of petals is given by the product of the number of flowers and the number of petals per flower: $3 \times 5 = 15$ petals.
2. For the 4 flowers with 6 petals each, the total number of petals is given by the product of the number of flowers and the number of petals per flower: $4 \times 6 = 24$ petals.
3. For the 5 flowers with 4 petals each, the total number of petals is given by the product of the number of flowers and the number of petals per flower: $5 \times 4 = 20$ petals.
4. For the 6 flowers with 7 petals each, the total number of petals is given by the product of the number of flowers and the number of petals per flower: $6 \times 7 = 42$ petals.

Now, let's add up the total number of petals from each set of flowers: $15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101$ petals.

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract the total number of lost petals, which is 4, from the total number of petals: $101 - 4 = 97$ petals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{97}$"
"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have, we need to calculate the remaining marshmallows after accounting for those used and dropped.

Let's denote the total number of marshmallows in the bag as M, the number of marshmallows used by John as J, the number of marshmallows used by DeSean as D, and the number of marshmallows dropped as d. We are given that M = 35, J = 9, D = 9, and d = 3.

The total number of marshmallows used and dropped is the sum of the marshmallows used by John and DeSean, plus the number of marshmallows dropped: J + D + d = 9 + 9 + 3 = 21.

To find the number of marshmallows left, we subtract the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number of marshmallows: M - (J + D + d) = 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are two kids, we can divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to determine the number of S'mores each kid can have: 14 ÷ 2 = 7.

Therefore, each kid can have 7 S'mores.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total amount of money used at the arcade, we need to calculate the total time played by each individual and then multiply it by the cost per minute.

Let's denote the time Jack plays as $t_J$, the time the two friends who are worse than Jack play as $t_{J1}$ and $t_{J2}$, and the time the friend who is better than Jack plays as $t_B$. We are given that $t_J = 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \cdot 60 = 240 \text{ minutes}$.

Since the two friends who are worse than Jack can only play for half as long, we have $t_{J1} = t_{J2} = \frac{1}{2}t_J = 120 \text{ minutes}$.

The friend who is better than Jack can play for 1.5 times as long, so $t_B = 1.5t_J = 1.5 \cdot 240 = 360 \text{ minutes}$.

The total time played is the sum of the individual times: $t_{\text{total}} = t_J + t_{J1} + t_{J2} + t_B = 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 \text{ minutes}$.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is $\frac{1}{20} = \$0.05$.

The total amount of money used is $t_{\text{total}} \cdot \text{cost per minute} = 840 \cdot 0.05 = \$42$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"To determine the amount of oil used in Tanya's salt scrub, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. Since the amount of salt (and sugar) is twice the amount of citrus zest, the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x. Furthermore, the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces, which is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 8x = 10.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

$$\frac{8x}{8} = \frac{10}{8}$$

$$x = \frac{10}{8}$$

$$x = 1.25$$

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total amount of money John spent at the market, we can calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then sum them.

The cost of the goats can be calculated as follows:

3 goats * $500 = 3 × 500 = $1500

The cost of the cows can be calculated as follows:

2 cows * $1500 = 2 × 1500 = $3000

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows:

Total cost = $1500 + $3000 = $4500

Therefore, John spent a total of $4500 at the market.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine the number of additional cupcakes Paul should purchase, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. Given that Paul requires a total of 63 cupcakes for the birthday party and he already possesses 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, we can calculate the number of additional cupcakes needed.

First, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul already has:

8 (chocolate cupcakes) + 40 (toffee cupcakes) = 48 cupcakes

Next, we subtract the number of cupcakes Paul already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs:

63 (total cupcakes needed) - 48 (cupcakes already have) = 15

Therefore, Paul should purchase 15 additional cupcakes to meet the required total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps. First, we need to determine the initial number of cars Joe has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, we can express this relationship as:

Joe's cars = 2 * Robert's cars
Joe's cars = 2 * 20
Joe's cars = 40

Next, we need to calculate the number of cars Joe sells. He sells 20% of his cars, which can be expressed as a decimal by dividing 20 by 100:

20% = 20/100 = 0.2

Now, we can multiply this decimal by the initial number of cars Joe has to find the number of cars he sells:

Cars sold = 0.2 * 40
Cars sold = 8

After selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold. This can be expressed as:

Cars given away = 2 * Cars sold
Cars given away = 2 * 8
Cars given away = 16

To find the total number of cars Joe gives away, we add the number of cars he sold and the number he gave away:

Total cars given away = Cars sold + Cars given away
Total cars given away = 8 + 16
Total cars given away = 24

Finally, we can find the number of cars Joe remains with by subtracting the total number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars:

Cars remaining = Initial cars - Total cars given away
Cars remaining = 40 - 24
Cars remaining = 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount each student raised, we first need to isolate the total amount contributed by the students. Given that the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from external organizations, the students' collective contribution can be calculated as follows:

Total amount raised by the charity = $175,000
Amount raised by external organizations = $50,000
Amount raised by the students = Total amount raised by the charity - Amount raised by external organizations
= $175,000 - $50,000
= $125,000

Now, to find the individual contribution of each student, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

Number of students = 20
Amount raised by the students = $125,000
Individual contribution per student = Amount raised by the students / Number of students
= $125,000 / 20
= $6,250

Therefore, each student raised $6,250 for the charity.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To determine the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. This can be converted to minutes by multiplying by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, the time spent on the first day is 8 × 60 = 480 minutes.

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours. Similarly, this can be converted to minutes by multiplying by 60, resulting in 4 × 60 = 240 minutes.

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is the sum of the time spent on the first and second days, which is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first calculate the number of cars present in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, resulting in a total of 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he observed that 1/2 of the cars had left. This implies that 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had departed. Therefore, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot at that time is 70 - 35 = 35.

The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is equal to the number of cars present in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break, which is 35.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we can calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of working days in a week. 

First, we need to find the total number of tasks John completes in a day. Since he does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle consists of 5 tasks, we can calculate the total number of tasks as follows:

Total tasks per day = Number of cycles per day * Number of tasks per cycle
Total tasks per day = 30 * 5
Total tasks per day = 150

Given that each task pays $1.20, we can now calculate John's daily earnings:

Daily earnings = Total tasks per day * Pay per task
Daily earnings = 150 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $180

Since John works a full 7-day week, we can find his weekly earnings by multiplying his daily earnings by 7:

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * 7
Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To determine the total points Sasha scored during both games, we can break down the information provided.

In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. It is given that Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game. Therefore, Julie's score in the first game is 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, Sasha struggled and scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food purchased by Kimberly, we first calculate the total number of tins of each type. Given that each package of cat food contains 11 tins and Kimberly bought 8 packages, the total number of tins of cat food is 8 × 11 = 88.

Similarly, since each package of dog food contains 6 tins and Kimberly bought 6 packages, the total number of tins of dog food is 6 × 6 = 36.

The difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food is then calculated as 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52}$"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of green eggs as G, blue eggs as B, pink eggs as P, and yellow eggs as Y.

We are given the following relationships:

1. G = 5 (the number of green eggs is given as 5)
2. B = 2G (the number of blue eggs is twice the number of green eggs)
3. P = B - 1 (the number of pink eggs is one fewer than the number of blue eggs)
4. Y = (1/3)P (the number of yellow eggs is one-third the number of pink eggs)

Substituting the value of G into equation 2, we get B = 2(5) = 10. Then, using equation 3, we find P = 10 - 1 = 9. Finally, using equation 4, we calculate Y = (1/3)(9) = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of eggs by adding the number of each color together: G + B + P + Y = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the amount Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

The cost of shipping can be calculated using the formula:

Total Cost = (Cost per pound * Weight) + (Cost per mile * Distance)

Given:
- Cost per pound: $0.35
- Weight of the book: 4 pounds
- Cost per mile: $0.08
- Distance: 20 miles

Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:

Total Cost = (0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20)
Total Cost = 1.4 + 1.6
Total Cost = $2.99

The refund amount is 75% of the purchase price, which can be calculated as:

Refund Amount = 0.75 * Purchase Price
Refund Amount = 0.75 * $32
Refund Amount = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:

Total Loss = Total Cost - Refund Amount
Total Loss = $2.99 - $24
Total Loss = $21.01

The final answer is: $21.01"
"To determine the amount of money Mulan has left, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. Initially, Mulan has $40. Her father's contribution increases her total to $40 + $100 = $140.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased. Two pairs of jeans at $30 each amount to 2 × $30 = $60. Additionally, she buys a bag for $20. Therefore, the total expenditure is $60 + $20 = $80.

To find the remaining amount, we subtract the total expenditure from the initial total: $140 - $80 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the production of chocolate bars in the fourth week, we can analyze the given information and apply basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the production of chocolate bars in the first week as $W_1$, the second week as $W_2$, and the third week as $W_3$. We are given that $W_1 = 8,000$ bars.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, so $W_2 = \frac{1}{2}W_1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 8,000 = 4,000$ bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so $W_3 = 3W_1 = 3 \cdot 8,000 = 24,000$ bars.

The total production of chocolate bars in the first three weeks is $W_1 + W_2 + W_3 = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000$ bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we can find the production of chocolate bars in the fourth week by subtracting the total production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production:

$W_4 = 50,000 - (W_1 + W_2 + W_3) = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000$ bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14,000}$"
"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on various activities per week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on writing songs per week. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 2 hours to minutes as follows:

2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Next, we need to calculate the time Britany spends on makeup per week. She spends 15 minutes on makeup six days a week, so we can calculate this as follows:

15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time Britany spends on recording videos per week. Since each video is 4 minutes long and she records 18 videos per week, we can calculate this as follows:

18 videos * 4 minutes per video = 72 minutes

To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok per week, we need to add the time spent on writing songs, makeup, and recording videos:

120 minutes (songs) + 90 minutes (makeup) + 72 minutes (videos) = 282 minutes

We can convert this to hours by dividing by 60:

282 minutes / 60 = 4.7 hours

Finally, to find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:

4.7 hours * 4 weeks = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{18.8}$"
"To determine the total cost of the interior design installation, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00. This is a fixed cost, which we can denote as C_initial = $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items.

Let's denote the number of additional mirrors as M, the number of additional chandeliers as C, and the number of additional pictures as P. We can calculate these values as follows:

M = 6 - 4 = 2
C = 2 - 1 = 1
P = 20 - 10 = 10

The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item. We can calculate the total cost of the additional items as follows:

C_additional = 15(M + C + P)
= 15(2 + 1 + 10)
= 15(13)
= $195.00

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items:

C_total = C_initial + C_additional
= $129.00 + $195.00
= $324.00

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To determine the amount of money Roy has saved, we can approach this problem by first establishing the amount saved by each individual. 

Let's denote the amount saved by Eva as E, Anthony as A, and Roy as R. We are given that Eva has saved $20.00, so E = $20.00.

We are also given that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so A = E + $10.00 = $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we are told that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we can express this as 0.4A. Substituting the value of A, we get 0.4($30.00) = $12.00.

To find the total amount Roy has saved, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: R = A + 0.4A = 1.4A = 1.4($30.00) = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To determine the height at which Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to establish a hierarchical relationship between the individuals' lifting capacities. Given that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, we can use this as a reference point to calculate the lifting capacities of the other individuals.

First, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay's lifting capacity is 12 inches.

Next, Kagiyami's lifting capacity is 4 times higher than Saskay's, which is 4 \* 12 = 48 inches.

Finally, Naruto's lifting capacity is 10 times higher than Kagiyami's, which is 10 \* 48 = 480 inches.

To convert this to feet, we divide by 12, as there are 12 inches in a foot. Therefore, Naruto's lifting capacity is 480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the total distance traveled by Mason, we can utilize the formula for distance, which is given by the product of speed and time. Given that Mason's speed is 8 miles per hour and he travels for two distinct periods, we can calculate the distance covered in each segment and then sum them to obtain the total distance.

Let's denote the distance covered in the first 4 hours as $d_1$ and the distance covered in the next 6 hours as $d_2$. Using the formula for distance, we have:

$d_1 = 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 32 \text{ miles}$

$d_2 = 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ miles}$

The total distance $d_{\text{total}}$ is the sum of $d_1$ and $d_2$:

$d_{\text{total}} = d_1 + d_2 = 32 \text{ miles} + 48 \text{ miles} = 80 \text{ miles}$

Therefore, the total distance traveled by Mason is 80 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway, we must first establish the time it takes for a single kangaroo to complete the journey. Given that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed require 18 hours to traverse the highway, we can calculate the time for a single kangaroo as follows:

t_kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours/kangaroo

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can express their speed as a fraction of the kangaroo's speed:

v_turtle = (1/2) * v_kangaroo

Using the relationship between speed, time, and distance (d = v * t), we can establish a proportionality between the time it takes for a kangaroo and a turtle to travel the same distance:

t_turtle = (2 * t_kangaroo)

Substituting the value of t_kangaroo, we get:

t_turtle = 2 * 6 hours = 12 hours/kangaroo

However, we are interested in the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway. Since the turtles are traveling at the same speed, we can multiply the time it takes for one turtle by the number of turtles:

t_four_turtles = 12 hours/kangaroo * 4 kangaroos = 48 hours

Therefore, it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, 48 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of dishes made by Kora as K, Rory as R, and Jada as J.

Given that Kora made 20 dishes, we have K = 20.

We are also given that Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so we can express this as R = K + 20. Substituting the value of K, we get R = 20 + 20 = 40.

Furthermore, Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, which can be expressed as J = 2R. Substituting the value of R, we get J = 2(40) = 80.

To find the total number of dishes made by all three, we add the number of dishes each person made: K + R + J = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we can start by calculating the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the sales assistant offered a discount of $200 for trading in her old laptop. Therefore, the discounted price of the laptop is:

$600 - $200 = $400

Erika has received a total of $230 from her part-time job and her mom's contribution. This amount is comprised of her weekly earnings of $150 and her mom's contribution of $80. 

Let's denote the initial amount of money Erika had in her purse as x. After receiving the $230, her total amount of money becomes x + $230. Since she needs an additional $50 to purchase the laptop, the total amount of money she has is equal to the discounted price of the laptop plus the additional $50:

x + $230 = $400 + $50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + $230 = $450

Subtracting $230 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = $220

Therefore, Erika has $220 in her purse.

The final answer is: $220"
"To solve this problem, we can apply basic arithmetic operations to determine the total number of apple slices and then subtract the number of slices Adam eats.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples. We know that a large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces and a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.

Let's denote the number of slices from the large apples as L and the number of slices from the small apples as S. We are given that Adam slices 3 large apples and 5 small apples. Therefore, we can express the total number of slices as:

L = 3 x 5 = 15
S = 5 x 3 = 15

The total number of slices is the sum of L and S:
Total slices = L + S = 15 + 15 = 30

Now, we know that Adam eats 15 slices. To find the number of slices left, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:
Slices left = Total slices - Slices eaten = 30 - 15 = 15

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of cows required to produce 25 liters of milk per day, we can use the concept of linear scaling. Given that each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we can calculate the total number of cows needed as follows:

Let x be the number of cows required to produce 25 liters of milk per day. We can set up the equation:

5x = 25

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 25 / 5
x = 5

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find the difference between the required number of cows and the number of cows he already has:

Number of cows needed = x - 3
= 5 - 3
= 2

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

Let's start by finding the unused portion of each glue stick. We know that a glue stick is 12 millimeters long originally. 

For the first glue stick, which has 1/6 left, we can calculate the unused portion as follows:

$$\frac{1}{6} \times 12 = \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{12}{1} = \frac{12}{6} = 2 \text{ millimeters}$$

For the second glue stick, which has 2/3 left, we can calculate the unused portion as follows:

$$\frac{2}{3} \times 12 = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{12}{1} = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \text{ millimeters}$$

For the third glue stick, which has 1/2 left, we can calculate the unused portion as follows:

$$\frac{1}{2} \times 12 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{12}{1} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}$$

Now, we add the unused portions together to find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used:

$$2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}$$

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."
"To determine the amount of money Gabriel still needs, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. The total cost of the items he wishes to purchase is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10080. 

Gabriel's current financial resources consist of $5000 from his weekend work and an additional $200 from his brother, totaling $5200.

To find the remaining amount needed, we subtract Gabriel's available funds from the total cost of the items:

$10080 - $5200 = $4880

Therefore, Gabriel still requires $4880 to purchase the car and phone."
"To determine the change Thea received, we need to calculate the difference between the amount she paid and the cost of the hat. 

The amount she paid is comprised of four $20 bills, which can be calculated as 4 * $20 = $80.

Now, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount: $80 - $70 = $10.

Therefore, Thea received $10 as change."
"To determine the amount of money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

Craig has 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is equivalent to 2 × $20 = $40.

He purchases 6 squirt guns at $2 each, resulting in a total expenditure of 6 × $2 = $12.

Additionally, he buys 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each, leading to a total expenditure of 3 × $3 = $9.

The total amount spent is the sum of the expenditures on squirt guns and water balloons, which is $12 + $9 = $21.

To find the amount of money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

"Given the problem, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of socks and dishes collected by Jack and Peter.

Let's denote the number of socks collected by Jack as S and the number of dishes collected by Jack as D. We are given that Jack collected 60 dishes, so D = 60.

We are also given that Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, which can be represented as D = 2S. Substituting D = 60 into this equation, we get 60 = 2S, and solving for S yields S = 30.

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter's socks (P) can be represented as P = 2S. Substituting S = 30 into this equation, we get P = 2(30) = 60.

We are also given that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter's dishes (Q) can be represented as Q = D/2. Substituting D = 60 into this equation, we get Q = 60/2 = 30.

To find the total number of socks and dishes collected by both Jack and Peter, we can add the number of socks and dishes collected by each of them. The total number of socks is S + P = 30 + 60 = 90, and the total number of dishes is D + Q = 60 + 30 = 90.

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes collected by Jack and Peter together is 90 + 90 = 180.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To determine the number of students good at math, we can utilize a Venn diagram or the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's denote the total number of students as T, the number of students good at math as M, the number of students good at English as E, and the number of students good at both as B.

Given:
- T = 20
- M - B = 5 (students good at math only)
- E - B = 8 (students good at English only)
- B = T - (M - B + E - B) (by the principle of inclusion-exclusion)

Simplifying the equation for B:
B = T - (M - B + E - B)
B = T - (M + E - 2B)
B = T - M - E + 2B
B - 2B = T - M - E
-B = T - M - E
B = M + E - T

Now, substitute the value of B in the equation M - B = 5:
M - (M + E - T) = 5
M - M - E + T = 5
-T - E = 5
M = T + E - 5

Substitute the given values:
M = 20 + 8 - 5
M = 23 - 5
M = 18

However, this is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the equation M = T + E - 5. We know that M - B = 5 and E - B = 8. Since B = M + E - T, we can substitute this value of B in the equation M - B = 5:
M - (M + E - T) = 5
M - M - E + T = 5
-T - E = 5
M = T + E - 5

We also know that E - B = 8. Since B = M + E - T, we can substitute this value of B in the equation E - B = 8:
E - (M + E - T) = 8
E - M - E + T = 8
-T - M = 8
M = T - 8

Now, substitute the value of T:
M = 20 - 8
M = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the maximum number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and then divide it by the time each group takes to perform, including getting on and off the stage.

Let's denote the time each group takes to perform as $t_g = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10$ minutes. The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is $t_{total} = 2 \times 60 = 120$ minutes. However, we need to subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total time, so the time available for performances is $t_{available} = t_{total} - 10 = 120 - 10 = 110$ minutes.

Now, we can calculate the maximum number of groups that can perform by dividing the available time by the time each group takes to perform: $n = \frac{t_{available}}{t_g} = \frac{110}{10} = 11$.

Therefore, the maximum number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we can utilize the formula for simple interest, which is given by:

A = P(1 + rt)

where A is the total amount, P is the principal (initial investment), r is the interest rate, and t is the time period in years.

Given that the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, we can express it as a decimal: r = 0.75. The principal amount P is $300, and the time period t is 3 years.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

A = 300(1 + 0.75*3)
A = 300(1 + 2.25)
A = 300(3.25)
A = 975

Therefore, Brenda will have a total of $975 after 3 years.

The final answer is: $975"
"To determine the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars, we first need to calculate the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

Let's start by finding the number of white shirts with no collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with collars is 40 / 2 = 20. Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, we need to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. Given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars by subtracting the latter from the former: 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the farmer's earnings, we can use a straightforward mathematical approach. Given that the farmer has 900 eggs and each tray holds 30 eggs, we can calculate the number of trays by dividing the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray.

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30

Now, to find the farmer's earnings, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray, which is $2.5.

Earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75 from selling the eggs.

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step. We have two farms, Farm X and Farm Y, with initial goat populations of 55 and 45, respectively. Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y.

First, we calculate the number of goats left in Farm X after the sale. This can be represented as:

Number of goats left in Farm X = Initial number of goats in Farm X - Number of goats sold from Farm X
= 55 - 10
= 45

Next, we determine the number of goats sold from Farm Y. Since Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as from Farm X, we can express this as:

Number of goats sold from Farm Y = 2 * Number of goats sold from Farm X
= 2 * 10
= 20

Now, we calculate the number of goats left in Farm Y after the sale:

Number of goats left in Farm Y = Initial number of goats in Farm Y - Number of goats sold from Farm Y
= 45 - 20
= 25

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:

Total number of goats left = Number of goats left in Farm X + Number of goats left in Farm Y
= 45 + 25
= 70

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the average cost of each pair of shoes, we can employ a straightforward calculation based on the given information. James purchases 2 pairs of shoes per month, which translates to 2 * 12 = 24 pairs per year. The total expenditure on shoes per year is $2640.

Using the formula for average cost, we can calculate the average cost per pair as follows:

Average Cost = Total Expenditure / Number of Pairs
= $2640 / 24
= $110

Therefore, the average cost per pair of shoes is $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To determine the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, we must first calculate the individual costs and then apply the discount for the red food.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food can be calculated as follows:

3 \* $25 = $75

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is:

3 \* $18 = $54

The total cost before applying the discount is the sum of these two costs:

$75 + $54 = $129

However, we are given a discount of $2 for each basket of red food. Since we are purchasing 3 baskets of red food, the total discount is:

3 \* $2 = $6

To find the total cost after the discount, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount:

$129 - $6 = $123

Therefore, the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, with a discount for the red food, is $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To determine the time required to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms in total, we can find one-half of this number by dividing 90 by 2.

45 rooms

Next, we need to calculate the total time it takes to clean 45 rooms. Given that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we can find the total time by multiplying the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour.

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the number of homes built in the first year, which is given as 12.

In the second year, the town will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. This can be expressed as 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

To find the total number of homes built in the first two years, we add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 = 48.

In the third year, the town will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, we can find the total number of homes built over the next three years by adding the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The final answer is: $\boxed{144}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote my age as x, my brother's age as x + 3, my sister's age as x - 2, and my mom's age as 3(x + 3) - 1.

We know that the sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87

Combine like terms:

5x + 10 + 3x + 8 - 1 = 87

Combine like terms:

8x + 17 = 87

Subtract 17 from both sides:

8x = 70

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 70/8

x = 8.75

However, since age cannot be a decimal, we need to re-examine the equation. Let's try to find a whole number solution.

We can rewrite the equation as:

5x + 3x + x + 10 + 8 - 1 = 87

Combine like terms:

9x + 17 = 87

Subtract 17 from both sides:

9x = 70

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 70/9

x = 7.78

However, this is still not a whole number. Let's try to find a whole number solution by testing different values of x.

We can start by testing x = 8:

5(8) + 3(8 + 3) - 2 + 3(8 + 3) - 1 = 40 + 27 - 2 + 33 - 1 = 97

This is too high, so we need to try a lower value of x.

Let's try x = 7:

5(7) + 3(7 + 3) - 2 + 3(7 + 3) - 1 = 35 + 30 - 2 + 30 - 1 = 92

This is still too high, so we need to try an even lower value of x.

Let's try x = 6:

5(6) + 3(6 + 3) - 2 + 3(6 + 3) - 1 = 30 + 27 - 2 + 27 - 1 = 81

This is still too high, so we need to try an even lower value of x.

Let's try x = 5:

5(5) + 3(5 + 3) - 2 + 3(5 + 3) - 1 = 25 + 24 - 2 + 24 - 1 = 70

This is equal to 70, so x = 5 is a possible solution.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can employ a straightforward division problem. Given that each student requires 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

Total number of glue sticks required = Number of students × Number of glue sticks per student
= 27 × 2
= 54

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we can calculate the number of packs required by dividing the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

Number of packs required = Total number of glue sticks required ÷ Number of glue sticks per pack
= 54 ÷ 8
= 6.75

However, since Mr. Jackson can only purchase whole packs, we must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure each student receives the required number of glue sticks. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the total amount of water passing through the river at a specific point, we need to consider the changes in water volume over the three days. 

Let's denote the initial amount of water as $W_1 = 4000$ gallons. On the second day, the water volume doubles, so the new amount of water is $W_2 = 2W_1 = 2 \times 4000 = 8000$ gallons. 

On the third day, the water volume increases by 6000 gallons, so the new amount of water is $W_3 = W_2 + 6000 = 8000 + 6000 = 14000$ gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to sum the water volumes for all three days: $W_{total} = W_1 + W_2 + W_3 = 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000$ gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24000}$"
"This problem can be modeled using the concept of exponential growth, which is a fundamental aspect of epidemiology and population dynamics. The number of people infected each day can be represented by the equation:

N(t) = N0 * (1 + r)^t

where N(t) is the number of people infected at time t, N0 is the initial number of people infected, r is the growth rate, and t is the time in days.

Given that each infected person infects 6 others, the growth rate r can be calculated as:

r = 6

The initial number of people infected, N0, is 10. We want to find the total number of people infected after 3 days, so t = 3.

Plugging in the values, we get:

N(3) = 10 * (1 + 6)^3
N(3) = 10 * (7)^3
N(3) = 10 * 343
N(3) = 3430

However, this calculation assumes that the growth rate remains constant over time, which is a simplification. A more accurate model would take into account the fact that the number of people infected each day is not only the product of the growth rate and the number of people infected the previous day, but also the cumulative effect of previous days.

A more accurate approach would be to use the formula for exponential growth with a finite population, which is:

N(t) = N0 * (1 + r)^t - N0

However, in this case, we can use a simpler approach by recognizing that the growth is geometric. The number of people infected each day is 6 times the number of people infected the previous day, plus the number of people infected the previous day. This can be represented as:

N(t) = N(t-1) * 7

We can use this recursive formula to calculate the number of people infected each day:

Day 1: N(1) = 10 * 7 = 70
Day 2: N(2) = 70 * 7 = 490
Day 3: N(3) = 490 * 7 = 3430

The final answer is: 3430"
"To determine the total amount of money received by Julieta and Rafaela as tips, we can start by calculating the total amount received by Rafaela. Since each of the 40 customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate her total as follows:

Rafaela's total tips = 40 customers * $20/customer = $800

Next, we need to find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, which is the amount by which Julieta received less than Rafaela. This can be calculated as:

10% of Rafaela's total tips = 0.1 * $800 = $80

Now, we can find Julieta's total tips by subtracting 10% of Rafaela's total tips from Rafaela's total tips:

Julieta's total tips = Rafaela's total tips - 10% of Rafaela's total tips
= $800 - $80
= $720

Finally, we can find the total amount of money received by both Julieta and Rafaela as tips by adding their individual totals:

Total tips = Rafaela's total tips + Julieta's total tips
= $800 + $720
= $1520

The final answer is: $1520"
"To determine the number of oranges Jennifer remained with, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, let's calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. Since she has three daughters, and each received 2 oranges, the total number of oranges given to her daughters is 3 * 2 = 6. Additionally, her only son received 3 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 + 3 = 9.

Now, to find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges: 12 - 9 = 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To solve this problem, we can establish a ratio of the number of badges earned by each individual. Let's denote the time it takes Claire to earn a badge as 't'. Since Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge, the time it takes Amber to earn a badge is 2t. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so the time it takes Wendy to earn a badge is t/3.

The number of badges earned by each individual in a year (12 months) can be calculated as follows:

- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1 badge / (2t) * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges / (t/3) * 12 months = 36 badges

However, we can simplify the calculation by considering the ratio of badges earned by each individual. Let's express the number of badges earned by each individual in terms of the time it takes Claire to earn a badge (t). 

- Claire: 1 badge/t * 12t = 12 badges
- Amber: 1 badge / (2t) * 12t = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges / (t/3) * 12t = 36 badges

Now, we can calculate the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in a year:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total amount raised by Paige, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold, and then multiply that by the price per slice.

Given that Paige bakes 2 banana bread loaves per hour and she operates for 5 hours, we can calculate the total number of loaves as follows:

2 loaves/hour × 5 hours = 10 loaves

Since each loaf is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

10 loaves × 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is equivalent to $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice:

80 slices × $0.50/slice = $40

Therefore, Paige raised a total of $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total number of coins Gretchen has, we can establish a relationship between the number of gold coins (G) and silver coins (S). Given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can express this as G = S + 30.

We are also given that Gretchen has 70 gold coins. Therefore, we can set up the equation S + 30 = 70 to find the number of silver coins.

To solve for S, we can subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

S + 30 - 30 = 70 - 30
S = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins:

Total coins = S + G
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic, we need to calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students and Mr. George.

First, let's calculate the total number of burritos eaten by the students. There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. This can be represented as:

Total burritos eaten by students = Number of students × Number of burritos per student
= 50 × 10
= 500

Next, we need to account for the burritos consumed by Mr. George. It is given that he ate 20 burritos.

Total burritos eaten = Total burritos eaten by students + Burritos eaten by Mr. George
= 500 + 20
= 520

Now, we can find the total number of leftover burritos by subtracting the total number of burritos eaten from the initial number of burritos ordered:

Total leftover burritos = Initial number of burritos - Total burritos eaten
= 600 - 520
= 80

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of red cars as R, the number of green cars as G, the number of blue cars as B, and the number of yellow cars as Y.

We are given the following information:

1. R = 12 (number of red cars)
2. G = R - 2 (number of green cars is 2 fewer than red cars)
3. B = 3G (number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars)
4. R + G + B + Y = 75 (total number of cars in the rink)

Substituting the given values into the equations, we get:

1. G = 12 - 2 = 10
2. B = 3(10) = 30
3. R + G + B + Y = 75

Now, we can substitute the values of R, G, and B into the total equation:

12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75

Combine like terms:

52 + Y = 75

Subtract 52 from both sides:

Y = 23

Therefore, the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink is 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of books Sofie, Anne, and Fawn possess.

Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

Given that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, we can express this relationship as S = A + 25.

Furthermore, we know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, which can be represented as A = F - 12.

We also know that the total number of books among the three individuals is 85, so we can write the equation S + A + F = 85.

Substituting the expression for S from the first equation into the third equation, we get (A + 25) + A + F = 85.

Combining like terms, we have 2A + F + 25 = 85.

Now, we can substitute the expression for A from the second equation into this equation, yielding 2(F - 12) + F + 25 = 85.

Expanding and simplifying, we get 2F - 24 + F + 25 = 85.

Combining like terms, we have 3F + 1 = 85.

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we obtain 3F = 84.

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that F = 28.

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To determine the weight of the carrots, we must first establish the weight of the sweet potatoes. Given that the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, we can express this relationship as:

Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * Weight of potatoes
Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * 5
Weight of sweet potatoes = 10 pounds

Next, we are informed that the carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. This can be represented as:

Weight of carrots = Weight of sweet potatoes - 3
Weight of carrots = 10 - 3
Weight of carrots = 7 pounds

Therefore, the weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To determine the total cost of Jello for Greg's son's birthday party, we need to calculate the total number of Jello cups required and then multiply it by the cost per box.

First, we calculate the total number of Jello cups needed. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 Jello cups, the total number of Jello cups required is 30 * 4 = 120.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of Jello are needed. Since one box of Jello makes 10 Jello cups, the number of boxes required is 120 / 10 = 12.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes by the cost per box. The cost of one box of Jello is $1.25, so the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

Therefore, the total cost of Jello for Greg's son's birthday party is $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the change the seller will receive, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones and subtract it from the amount given by the seller. 

The cost of each phone is $700, and the seller purchased 5 phones. Therefore, the total cost of the phones is:

5 phones * $700/phone = $3500

Now, we need to find the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount given by the seller, which is $4000. 

Change = Amount given - Total cost
Change = $4000 - $3500
Change = $500

The final answer is: $500"
"To determine the amount Keenan spends per week, we first need to calculate his share of the monthly grocery expenses. Given that Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

The total monthly expenditure on groceries is $400. To find Keenan's share, we can calculate 40% of $400 as follows:

40% of $400 = 0.4 × $400 = $160

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can find Keenan's weekly expenditure by dividing his monthly expenditure by 4:

$160 ÷ 4 = $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces consumed on each day and sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces eaten on the first day. Tobias ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. This can be expressed as a fraction and then evaluated as follows:

$$\frac{2}{5} \cdot 60 = \frac{2 \cdot 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24$$

So, on the first day, Tobias consumed 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's calculate the number of pieces remaining after the first two days:

$$60 - 24 - 10 = 26$$

Next, we need to find out how many pieces he ate on the third day. He consumed 7/13 of the remaining pieces, which can be calculated as follows:

$$\frac{7}{13} \cdot 26 = \frac{7 \cdot 26}{13} = \frac{182}{13} = 14$$

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate on each day:

$$24 + 10 + 14 = 48$$

Therefore, Tobias has eaten a total of 48 pizza pieces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we can employ a straightforward approach by first calculating the unit price of each item and then multiplying it by the desired quantity.

Let's begin by finding the unit price of a single bottle of soda. Given that 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, we can calculate the unit price as follows:

$$\frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00$$

This indicates that a single bottle of soda costs $3.00.

Next, we'll find the unit price of a single bottle of water. Since 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, we can calculate the unit price as follows:

$$\frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00$$

This reveals that a single bottle of water costs $2.00.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water by multiplying the unit price of each item by the desired quantity and summing the results:

$$\text{Cost of 3 bottles of soda} = 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00$$
$$\text{Cost of 2 bottles of water} = 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00$$
$$\text{Total cost} = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00$$

Therefore, the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00.

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To determine the amount of money David has left after purchasing the bolts, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts. Since each bolt costs $0.03, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of bolts by the cost per bolt:

16 bolts * $0.03/bolt = $0.48

Now, we can subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after purchasing the bolts.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine Ella's earnings after 12 hours of dog walking at the same rate, we first need to calculate her hourly wage. This can be done by dividing the total amount earned ($33) by the number of hours worked (3).

Ella's hourly wage = Total earnings / Number of hours worked
= $33 / 3 hours
= $11 per hour

Now, we can calculate her earnings after 12 hours by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she will work.

Earnings after 12 hours = Hourly wage * Number of hours worked
= $11 per hour * 12 hours
= $132

Therefore, Ella's earnings after 12 hours of dog walking at the same rate will be $132.

The final answer is: $132"
"To determine the number of marbles Paul has left, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

Initially, Paul possesses 52 marbles. His friend then gifts him 28 marbles, increasing his total to 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Next, we need to calculate the number of marbles Paul loses, which is 1/4 of his current total. To find 1/4 of 80, we can use the formula:

$$\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = \frac{80}{4} = 20$$

Therefore, Paul loses 20 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from his current total to find the number of marbles he has left:

$$80 - 20 = 60$$

Thus, Paul has 60 marbles left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she earns from each type of question and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Since Amy correctly answers 80% of these questions and each question is worth 1 point, we can express this as:

Multiple-choice points = (0.8)(10) = 8 points

Next, we'll calculate the points from the true/false questions. Amy correctly answers 90% of these questions, and each question is worth 1 point. This can be expressed as:

True/false points = (0.9)(20) = 18 points

Lastly, we'll calculate the points from the long-answer questions. Amy correctly answers 60% of these questions, and each question is worth 5 points. This can be expressed as:

Long-answer points = (0.6)(5)(5) = 15 points

Now, we can sum up the points from each type of question to find Amy's total score:

Total points = Multiple-choice points + True/false points + Long-answer points
             = 8 + 18 + 15
             = 41

The final answer is: $\boxed{41}$"
"To determine the cost price of the chickens, we first need to calculate the total revenue Isaias will generate from selling the chickens. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens at $50 each, we can calculate the total revenue as follows:

Total revenue = (3/5) * 300 * $50

Using the distributive property of multiplication, we can rewrite this expression as:

Total revenue = (3 * $50) * (300/5)
Total revenue = $150 * 60
Total revenue = $9000

However, we are given that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost price of the chickens can be found by subtracting the desired profit from the total revenue:

Total cost price = Total revenue - Desired profit
Total cost price = $9000 - $2000
Total cost price = $7000

Thus, the cost price of the chickens is $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To determine the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah, we first need to calculate the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell. Since they sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses sold by 2.

Let's denote the total number of glasses sold as $T$, the number of glasses sold by Julie as $J$, and the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell as $M$. We are given that $T = 32$ and $J = 14$. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can express this as $M = \frac{T - J}{2}$.

Substituting the given values, we get $M = \frac{32 - 14}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9$.

Now, to find the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah, we subtract the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie: $J - M = 14 - 9 = 5$.

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we can break down the costs of each service. Let's denote the cost of the hair service as H, the cost of the manicure as M, and the cost of the pedicure as P.

Given that the cost of the hair service is $400, we can express the cost of the manicure as M = (1/4)H = (1/4)($400) = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, so we can express it as P = (3/4)M = (3/4)($100) = $75.

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent at the spa by adding the costs of the hair service, manicure, and pedicure: Total = H + M + P = $400 + $100 + $75 = $575.

The final answer is: $575"
"To determine the amount of money Sarah will have left over after purchasing a new rope, we need to calculate the profit from selling the original rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling the original rope. Given that the rope is 20 meters long and her friend is willing to buy it for $2 per meter, the total revenue can be calculated as follows:

Revenue = Price per meter × Length of rope
= $2/meter × 20 meters
= $40

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and Sarah plans to buy a rope of the same length (20 meters). Therefore, the cost of the new rope is:

Cost = Price per meter × Length of rope
= $1.5/meter × 20 meters
= $30

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the cost of the new rope from the revenue:

Profit = Revenue - Cost
= $40 - $30
= $10

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after purchasing the new rope.

The final answer is: $10"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age, we can use algebraic reasoning.

Let's denote the current age of Melanie as 'A' and the number of years it takes for her age to be thrice her present age as 'x'. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, so her current age is A = 18 - 10 = 8 years.

We can set up the equation based on the given condition: A + x = 3A. Substituting the value of A, we get 8 + x = 3(8).

Simplifying the equation, we get 8 + x = 24.

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation: x = 24 - 8.

x = 16.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 16 years for her age to be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item. The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10. The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120, since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12. The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14, since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.

The total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart is $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

Since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly has overspent her budget by $91.

The final answer is: $-91"
"To determine the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let x represent the runtime of her usual concerts in minutes. The final concert, being twice as long as her usual concerts, has a runtime of 2x minutes. Additionally, the 15-minute encore is performed at the end of the concert. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is given by the equation 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we can isolate the variable by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15, which simplifies to 2x = 50.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x: x = 50 / 2, which yields x = 25.

Thus, the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the number of toys Argo has now, we can apply the principle of subtraction to find the difference between the initial number of toys and the total number of toys given away.

Let's denote the initial number of toys as T = 200. The total number of toys given away can be calculated by adding the number of toys given to Alyssa, Bonnie, and Nicky: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150.

Now, we can calculate the number of toys Argo has now by subtracting the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys: T - 150 = 200 - 150 = 50.

Therefore, Argo has 50 toys now.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total number of chimichangas made by the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we can apply basic arithmetic operations.

First, we note that the shop makes 125 chimichangas on both Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on these two days is 125 + 125 = 250.

Next, we are informed that the shop makes twice as many chimichangas on Fridays as on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Since they make 125 chimichangas on each of these days, the number of chimichangas made on Fridays is 2 * 125 = 250.

To find the total number of chimichangas made on these three days, we add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays and Wednesdays to the number made on Fridays: 250 + 250 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of percentages to find the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's denote the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs as x. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones arranged in pairs is 2x.

We know that 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, which means 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. We can set up the equation:

0.8 * 50 = 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

0.8 * 50 / 2 = x
40 / 2 = x
x = 20

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and then sum them up.

First, let's consider the number of birds nesting in the bushes, which is given as 6. 

Next, we have 2/3 of the number of birds flying overhead. To find this, we can multiply the number of birds nesting by 2/3: 

$$\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = \frac{2 \times 6}{3} = \frac{12}{3} = 4$$

Now, we have 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we can multiply the number of groups by the number of birds per group:

$$3 \times 8 = 24$$

Now, let's add the number of birds in each group to find the total:

$$6 + 4 + 24 = 34$$

Therefore, Jerry counts a total of 34 birds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the number of cookies in each jar, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. Given that Lani baked a total of 55 cookies and consumed 5, we can calculate the remaining cookies as follows:

Total cookies = 55
Cookies eaten = 5
Cookies left = Total cookies - Cookies eaten = 55 - 5 = 50

Since Lani distributed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we can find the number of cookies per jar by dividing the total cookies left by the number of jars:

Cookies per jar = Cookies left / Number of jars = 50 / 5 = 10

Therefore, each jar contains 10 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids, we first calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower. The orchids have 5 petals each, and there are 5 orchids, so the total number of petals on the orchids is given by the product of these two quantities: $5 \times 5 = 25$ petals.

Similarly, the daisies have 10 petals each, and there are 4 daisies, so the total number of petals on the daisies is given by the product of these two quantities: $4 \times 10 = 40$ petals.

Now, to find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: $40 - 25 = 15$ petals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we can break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, we calculate the number of indoor plants, which is one-fourth of the total number of plants: $\frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25$ indoor plants.

Next, we find the number of remaining plants, which is the total number of plants minus the indoor plants: $100 - 25 = 75$ plants.

Then, we calculate the number of outdoor plants, which is two-thirds of the remaining plants: $\frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50$ outdoor plants.

The number of flowering plants is the remaining plants after subtracting the outdoor plants: $75 - 50 = 25$ flowering plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: $\frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25\%$.

Therefore, the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden is 25%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, whatchamacallit, and thingamabob. Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as $v_t$. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, its speed can be expressed as $v_w = 11v_t$. We are also given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can write the equation:

$$11v_t = 121$$

Solving for $v_t$, we get:

$$v_t = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ m/s}$$

Now, we are told that the whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob. Therefore, its speed can be expressed as $v_h = 5v_t$. Substituting the value of $v_t$, we get:

$$v_h = 5 \cdot 11 = 55 \text{ m/s}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To determine the cost of one carrot, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of one carrot as 'x'. Since Ellen eats two carrots, the total cost of the carrots is 2x. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is $3.

The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11, so we can write the equation:

2x + 6 + 3 = 11

Combine the constants: 2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2: x = 1

Therefore, the cost of one carrot is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the total number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's hourly wage was initially $10, but it was increased by $2. Therefore, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, which translates to a total of 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

To find Mark's weekly earnings, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 
Since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x + 3x + 5x = 9x. 

We know that she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. Therefore, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

We also know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

We can solve for x by isolating it in the equation 54x + y = 80. However, we need to find the value of y first. Since we know that she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, we can assume that x = 1 (since she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, which is one lawn). 

Substituting x = 1 into the equation 54x + y = 80, we get:
54(1) + y = 80
54 + y = 80
y = 80 - 54
y = 26

Therefore, the amount she made from lemonade sales is $26.

The final answer is: $26"

Let's denote Martin's weight as M, Carl's weight as C, Christian's weight as Ch, and Harry's weight as H. We are given the following information:

1. M = 55 kg
2. C = M + 16
3. Ch = C + 8
4. H = Ch - 5

Substituting the value of M into equation (2), we get:
C = 55 + 16
C = 71 kg

Now, substituting the value of C into equation (3), we get:
Ch = 71 + 8
Ch = 79 kg

Finally, substituting the value of Ch into equation (4), we get:
H = 79 - 5
H = 74 kg

Therefore, Harry's weight is 74 kg.

The final answer is: $\boxed{74}$"
"To determine John's profit from renting his car, we need to calculate his total revenue and subtract his car payment. 

First, let's calculate the total revenue. We know that John rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, and he gets paid $25 per hour. 

Total revenue = Number of rentals * Number of hours per rental * Hourly rate
Total revenue = 10 * 3 * $25
Total revenue = $750

Now, we need to subtract the car payment from the total revenue to find the profit.

Profit = Total revenue - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

Therefore, John's profit from renting his car is $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"Let's analyze the given information:

Let M represent the number of notebooks Martha initially had. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, we can express the number of notebooks Joseph had as 3M.

We are given that Martha bought 5 more notebooks, and now she has a total of 7 notebooks. This can be represented by the equation M + 5 = 7.

To find the value of M, we can solve the equation:

M + 5 = 7

Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation gives us:

M = 2

Now that we know Martha initially had 2 notebooks, we can find the number of notebooks Joseph had by multiplying 2 by 3:

3M = 3(2) = 6

Since Martha now has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 6 notebooks, we can find the difference in the number of notebooks they have:

7 - 6 = 1

Therefore, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we can start by identifying the distance rowed by Dijana, which is given as 50 miles. 

Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To calculate this, we can express Anis's distance as a function of Dijana's distance: Anis's distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance). 

Substituting the given value for Dijana's distance, we get Anis's distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50) = 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, to find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we can simply add their individual distances: total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance = 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"

"To determine the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel, we can calculate their individual totals and then find the difference.

Let's denote the number of pages Denise read yesterday as $D_y$ and the number of pages Daniel read yesterday as $D_{dy}$. We are given that $D_y = 10$ and $D_{dy} = 13$.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which can be expressed as $D_y + 5 = D_{dy} + 5$. Since we know $D_y = 10$, we can substitute this value to find the number of pages Denise read today: $10 + 5 = 15$.

However, we are also given that Daniel did not read any pages today, so his total remains $D_{dy} = 13$.

To find the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel, we can subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: $D_y + (D_y + 5) - D_{dy} = 10 + 15 - 13 = 12$.

Therefore, Denise read 12 more pages than Daniel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to consider the capacity of the pot and the number of people eating dinner.

Given that the pot can fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls, we can establish a ratio of adult to child bowls as 1:2. This means that for every 1 adult bowl, 2 child bowls can be filled.

Since there are 4 adults and 2 children eating dinner, a total of 6 people will consume soup. We can represent this as 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, as per the given ratio.

After dinner, the number of child bowls left can be calculated by subtracting the number of child bowls used from the total capacity of the pot. Since 4 adult bowls were used, which is equivalent to 4 child bowls, we have 8 - 4 = 4 child bowls left.

Now, we need to determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. Since there are 2 children and 4 child bowls left, we can divide the remaining child bowls by the number of children to find the answer.

Let's calculate the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch:

Number of child bowls left = 4
Number of children = 2

Number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch = Number of child bowls left / Number of children
= 4 / 2
= 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total amount William spent, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the cost of the notebooks. Since William purchased five notebooks at $1.50 each, we can express this as a multiplication problem: 5 × $1.50. Using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can rewrite this as (5 × $1) + (5 × $0.50). 

Now, we can perform the multiplication operations: 5 × $1 = $5 and 5 × $0.50 = $2.50. Adding these results together, we get $5 + $2.50 = $7.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the ballpen, which is $0.50.

To find the total amount William spent, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together: $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the total material required for Jo's face mask production, we need to calculate the material needed for small and large masks separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the material required for small masks. Given that 2 yards of material can make 4 small masks, the material per small mask is 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards per mask. Therefore, the material needed for 20 small masks is 20 * 0.5 yards = 10 yards.

Next, we calculate the material required for large masks. Since 2.25 yards of material can make 3 large masks, the material per large mask is 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards per mask. Consequently, the material needed for 8 large masks is 8 * 0.75 yards = 6 yards.

To find the total material required, we add the material needed for small and large masks: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. Given that she saw each of the 9 movies three times, the total number of tickets she purchased is 9 * 3 = 27.

The total amount she spent on these tickets is $216. To find the average price per ticket, we can use the formula:

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets

Substituting the given values, we get:

Average price per ticket = $216 / 27

To simplify this expression, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9:

Average price per ticket = (216 ÷ 9) / (27 ÷ 9)
= 24 / 3
= $8

Therefore, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8."
"To determine Harold's free time, we must first calculate the total hours in a day and then subtract the hours he spends on sleep, work, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a standard day. 

Let's denote Harold's sleep time as S, work time as W, and dog-walking time as D. We are given that S = 10 hours, W = S - 2 = 8 hours, and D = 1 hour.

Total hours spent = S + W + D
Total hours spent = 10 + 8 + 1
Total hours spent = 19 hours

Now, we can calculate Harold's free time by subtracting the total hours spent from the total hours in a day.

Free time = Total hours in a day - Total hours spent
Free time = 24 - 19
Free time = 5 hours

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time in a day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of red shoeboxes used by Tim. Since he used 1/3 of his red shoeboxes, we can calculate this as follows:

Let's denote the total number of red shoeboxes as R. Then, 1/3 of R is the number of red shoeboxes used. We know that the total number of red shoeboxes is 9, so we can set up the equation:

1/3R = 3

To solve for R, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

R = 3 * 3
R = 9

However, this is the total number of red shoeboxes, and we already know that. We want to find out how many red shoeboxes were used. Since 1/3 of the red shoeboxes were used, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of red shoeboxes used = 1/3 * R
= 1/3 * 9
= 9/3
= 3

So, Tim used 3 red shoeboxes.

Initially, Tim had 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes. After using 3 blue and 3 red shoeboxes, he is left with:

Blue shoeboxes: 7 - 3 = 4
Red shoeboxes: 9 - 3 = 6

Therefore, the total number of shoeboxes left is 4 (blue) + 6 (red) = 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the current number of books Joseph has, we first need to establish the initial number of books he possessed. Since Joseph had twice the number of books as Sarah, and Sarah has 9 books, we can express this relationship as a simple ratio.

Let's denote the number of books Sarah has as S, and the number of books Joseph has as J. We know that J = 2S. Given that S = 9, we can substitute this value into the equation to find J.

J = 2S
J = 2(9)
J = 18

Now that we know Joseph initially had 18 books, we need to account for the 2 books he lost. To find the current number of books Joseph has, we subtract the number of lost books from the initial number of books.

J_current = J - 2
J_current = 18 - 2
J_current = 16

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To determine the number of marbles Dean has left, we need to calculate the total number of marbles he gave away. 

First, let's find 1/5 of 30, which is the fraction of marbles Dean gave to Jamie. This can be calculated as:

$$\frac{1}{5} \times 30 = \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{30}{1} = \frac{30}{5} = 6$$

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Next, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

In total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

To find the number of marbles Dean has left, we subtract the total marbles given away from the initial number of marbles:

$$30 - 16 = 14$$

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago

We know that Duncan's current age is 60, so we can express his age eight years ago as 60 - 8 = 52. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

52 = 2x

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means that Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = 26 + 4 = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

The final answer is: $\boxed{38}$"
"To determine the total acres of the two farms, we first need to calculate the number of acres in Farmer Smith's farm. This can be done by finding twice the number of acres in Farmer Brown's farm and then adding 100 to that result.

Let's denote the number of acres in Farmer Brown's farm as $B$. We are given that $B = 200$ acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the number of acres in Farmer Brown's farm. Therefore, the number of acres in Farmer Smith's farm can be expressed as $2B + 100$. Substituting the value of $B$, we get $2(200) + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500$ acres.

Now, to find the total number of acres in both farms, we simply add the number of acres in each farm: $B + (2B + 100) = 200 + 500 = 700$ acres.

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"To determine Colby's earnings in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Let's denote the number of packages Colby completes per hour as $p$. We are given that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so we can express this as $p = 50 - 10 = 40$ packages per hour.

In an 8-hour workday, the total number of packages Colby completes is given by the product of his hourly rate and the number of hours worked: $p \cdot 8 = 40 \cdot 8 = 320$ packages.

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day are $320 \cdot 0.20 = 64$ dollars.

Therefore, Colby's earnings in a typical eight-hour workday are $64 dollars.

The final answer is: $64"
"To determine the number of bottles of water John drinks while solving a sudoku puzzle, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time interval at which he drinks a bottle.

A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes to solve. An extreme sudoku, being a more complex variant, takes four times as long to solve. Therefore, the time required to solve an extreme sudoku is 4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes, we can calculate the number of bottles he drinks by dividing the total time by the time interval between drinks: 180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of red balloons as R and the number of yellow balloons as Y. We are given that R = 20.

We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58. We can set up the following equation based on this information:

2R + 3Y = 58

Substituting R = 20 into the equation, we get:

2(20) + 3Y = 58

Expanding the equation, we get:

40 + 3Y = 58

Subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation, we get:

3Y = 18

Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get:

Y = 6

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon's car requires, we need to calculate the total distance driven over the 30-day period. Given that Jon drives 100 miles per day, the total distance can be calculated as follows:

Total distance = 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can calculate the number of tune-ups needed by dividing the total distance by 1000:

Number of tune-ups = Total distance / 1000 = 3000 / 1000 = 3

Therefore, Jon's car will require 3 tune-ups over the 30-day period.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total hours Bruce works over the three days, we can calculate the hours worked each day and then sum them up.

Let's denote the hours worked on Tuesday as T. Given that Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday, we have T = 5.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so the hours worked on Wednesday can be expressed as 2T. Substituting the value of T, we get 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which can be represented as 2T - 2. Substituting the value of 2T, we get 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total hours worked by adding the hours worked each day: T + 2T + (2T - 2) = 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the amount of allowance each girl received, we can approach this problem by first calculating the total amount spent on the birthday surprise and then dividing it by 2.

The cost of the cake is $11. The cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, the number of 2-balloon sets is 12 / 2 = 6. So, the cost of 1 dozen balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total cost of the birthday surprise is the sum of the individual costs: $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2:

$$\frac{\$28}{2} = \$14$$

Therefore, each girl received $14 as their allowance.

The final answer is: $14"
"To determine the number of pieces of fruit left after Lola ate 2 pieces, we first need to calculate the total number of fruits Kira purchased. This can be achieved by summing the quantities of each type of fruit.

Let's denote the number of apples as A, bananas as B, and oranges as O. We are given that A = 3, B = 5, and O = 6. Therefore, the total number of fruits, denoted as T, is:

T = A + B + O
T = 3 + 5 + 6
T = 14

Now, we need to subtract the number of fruits Lola ate, denoted as L, from the total number of fruits. We are given that L = 2. Therefore, the number of fruits left, denoted as F, is:

F = T - L
F = 14 - 2
F = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students participating in each sport and then sum these values.

Let's begin by identifying the number of students playing tennis. We are given that there are 6 students participating in this sport.

Next, we are informed that the number of students playing volleyball is twice the number playing tennis. Therefore, the number of students playing volleyball is 2 * 6 = 12.

Moving on to the soccer team, we are provided with the number of boys and girls participating in the sport. There are 16 boys and 22 girls, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, to find the total number of students, we sum the number of students participating in each sport: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The total number of students is 56."
"To determine the profit generated from the sale of lollipops, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

The total revenue can be calculated as the product of the number of students, the number of lollipops sold per student, and the price per lollipop. Given that there are 30 students, each selling 10 lollipops at $0.8 per lollipop, the total revenue is:

Total revenue = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student * $0.8/lollipop
Total revenue = 300 * $0.8
Total revenue = $240

The total cost, on the other hand, is the product of the number of students, the number of lollipops sold per student, and the cost per lollipop. Since the lollipops were bought for $0.5 each, the total cost is:

Total cost = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student * $0.5/lollipop
Total cost = 300 * $0.5
Total cost = $150

The profit is then calculated as the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $150
Profit = $90

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we can break down the information provided and calculate the number of each type of pet.

Let's start by identifying the number of cats, which is given as 3.

Since Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats, we can express this relationship as:

Dogs = 3 × Cats
Dogs = 3 × 3
Dogs = 9

Next, we are told that Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. This can be represented as:

Rabbits = Dogs - 2
Rabbits = 9 - 2
Rabbits = 7

We are also informed that the number of fish in the tank is three times the number of rabbits:

Fish = 3 × Rabbits
Fish = 3 × 7
Fish = 21

Furthermore, the number of gerbils is one-third the number of fish:

Gerbils = 1/3 × Fish
Gerbils = 1/3 × 21
Gerbils = 7

To find the total number of pets, we can sum the number of each type of pet:

Total Pets = Cats + Dogs + Rabbits + Fish + Gerbils
Total Pets = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7
Total Pets = 47

The final answer is: 47"
"To determine the number of days a loaf of bread will last for Abby and Josh, we need to consider their combined daily consumption. Given that Abby consumes 2 slices per day and Josh consumes twice as much, his daily consumption is 2 * 2 = 4 slices.

Their combined daily consumption is the sum of their individual consumption rates, which is 2 + 4 = 6 slices per day.

To find the number of days the loaf of bread will last, we divide the total number of slices by their combined daily consumption: 24 / 6 = 4.

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last 4 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Martha began collecting shells at the age of 5, and we are interested in the total number of shells she has accumulated by her 10th birthday.

First, we calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since Martha has been collecting shells for 5 years, and there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of months as follows:

5 years × 12 months/year = 60 months

Given that Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is equivalent to the total number of months she has been collecting. Therefore, we can conclude that Martha has collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to find the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, each row contains 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Let's denote the number of mint tea cups in each row as x. Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of chamomile tea cups in each row is also x. The total number of mint tea cups is 3x, and the total number of chamomile tea cups is 3x.

We know that the total number of tea cups is 27, and the remaining cups after brewing chamomile and mint tea are used to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea. This means that the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since the total number of chamomile and mint tea cups is 6x (3x + 3x), we can set up the equation 6x = 12 to find the value of x.

6x = 12

Dividing both sides by 6, we get:

x = 12 / 6
x = 2

However, this is the number of cups of mint tea in each row, but since we are looking for the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we need to multiply this by 3 to get the total number of mint tea cups in each row, which is 3 * 2 = 6."
"To determine the minimum number of berries the three-toed sloth can collect per trip, we need to consider the time constraints and the total number of berries he wants to collect.

Given that it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip (down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up), we can calculate the number of trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Let's denote the number of trips as $n$. Since each trip takes 4 hours, the total time spent on trips is $4n$. We want to find the maximum number of trips he can make in 8 hours, so we set up the inequality $4n \leq 8$. Solving for $n$, we get $n \leq 2$. Since $n$ must be an integer (you can't make a fraction of a trip), the maximum number of trips he can make in 8 hours is 2.

Now, we need to find the minimum number of berries he can collect per trip. Let's denote the number of berries collected per trip as $b$. Since he wants to collect a total of 24 berries in 8 hours, and he can make 2 trips, we can set up the equation $2b = 24$. Solving for $b$, we get $b = 12$.

Therefore, the minimum number of berries the sloth can collect per trip is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we first need to calculate the initial amount of water transferred to the tank. Given that the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, we can express this as:

Initial water in tank = (1/2) * Total water in pool
= (1/2) * 10000 gallons
= 5000 gallons

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of water used from the tank over a period of 6 days. The tank is emptied at a constant rate of 500 gallons per day, so we can express this as:

Total water used = Rate of water usage * Time
= 500 gallons/day * 6 days
= 3000 gallons

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount:

Remaining water in tank = Initial water in tank - Total water used
= 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons
= 2000 gallons

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To determine the number of movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget. Given that his monthly allowance is $150, we can subtract the costs of the movies and snacks he has already purchased.

Colby has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: $10 \times 5 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: $7 \times 8 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: $8 \times 2 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: $2 \times 4 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday. 

Now, let's calculate how much money is left for other days: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $\frac{\$10}{\$7} = 1.4286$ more movies on other days. However, since we cannot see a fraction of a movie, we round down to 1.

Total movies Colby can see: 1 (on Friday) + 1 (on other days) = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then sum them together.

First, let's consider the mini cinnamon rolls. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has $\frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200$ calories. Since Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, the total calories from cinnamon rolls are $200 \times 200 = 40,000$ calories.

Next, let's consider the mini blueberry muffins. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has $\frac{1}{3} \times 450 = 150$ calories. Since Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, the total calories from blueberry muffins are $300 \times 150 = 45,000$ calories.

The total calories from both types of pastries are $40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000$ calories.

The final answer is: $\boxed{85000}$"
"To calculate the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to determine the total number of Junebugs she removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs per day. Therefore, the total number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156.

On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs, and on Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs removed is the sum of the Junebugs removed each day: 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300.

There are 5 days in total. To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs removed by the number of days: 300 / 5 = 60.

The average number of Junebugs removed per day is 60."
"To determine the difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car, we can apply the formula for distance, which is given by the product of speed and time.

Given that the bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, we can calculate its distance traveled as follows:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 60 miles/hour × 5 hours
= 60 × 5
= 300 miles

Similarly, for the car traveling at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, we can calculate its distance traveled as follows:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 30 miles/hour × 8 hours
= 30 × 8
= 240 miles

To find the difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car, we can subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:

Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
= 300 miles - 240 miles
= 60 miles

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the number of bouncy balls, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of bouncy balls as 'x'. The total number of toys before purchasing the bouncy balls is the sum of the blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings, which is 31 + 8 + 9 = 48. After purchasing the bouncy balls, the total number of toys becomes 62.

We can express this situation as an equation:

48 + x = 62

To solve for 'x', we subtract 48 from both sides of the equation:

x = 62 - 48
x = 14

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a system of linear equations to solve for Peter's age. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. P + Pp + J = 100
2. Pp = J + 10
3. P = Pp + J

From equation 2, we can substitute Pp with J + 10 in equation 1:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now, we can substitute P with Pp + J in the equation P + 2J + 10 = 100:
(Pp + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Substitute Pp with J + 10:
(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we have J, we can find Pp:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 20 + 10
Pp = 30

Now that we have Pp, we can find P:
P = Pp + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total number of water balloons, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Initially, Maria had 1 water balloon, and each of her 4 friends had 2 balloons. This yields a total of 9 balloons, as calculated below:

1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9

Subsequently, Maria's mom provided each individual with 3 additional balloons. Given that there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:

5 * 3 = 15

To obtain the final count, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:

9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24

Therefore, the total number of water balloons is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of tables required for the charity yard sale, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of items they have and then divide that by the number of boxes that can fit per table.

First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of items. The charity group receives 10 donations of 5 boxes each, resulting in 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. Additionally, they already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Next, we need to determine the number of tables required to accommodate these boxes. Since each table can hold 2 boxes, we divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the number of tables needed: 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, the charity group already owns 15 tables. To find the number of additional tables required, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables needed: 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 additional tables for the yard sale.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney in their watermelon seed spitting contest, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each participant and then divide by the total number of seeds spat.

Let's denote the number of seeds spat by Zoey as $n_Z$ and the number of seeds spat by Sydney as $n_S$. The distance spat by each seed is given as 10 feet for Zoey and 12 feet for Sydney. Therefore, the total distance spat by Zoey is $10n_Z$ and the total distance spat by Sydney is $12n_S$.

Given that Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet, we have $n_Z = 40$. Similarly, given that Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet, we have $n_S = 35$.

The total distance spat by Zoey is $10n_Z = 10 \cdot 40 = 400$ feet, and the total distance spat by Sydney is $12n_S = 12 \cdot 35 = 420$ feet.

The total distance spat by both participants is the sum of their individual distances, which is $400 + 420 = 820$ feet. The total number of seeds spat is $n_Z + n_S = 40 + 35 = 75$.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the total number of seeds spat: $\frac{820}{75} = 10.9333\ldots$ feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10.93}$"
"To determine the difference in revenue between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

Let $n$ be the number of hours the machine operates in a month. Since the machine operates 24 hours a day and there are 30 days in a month, we have $n = 24 \cdot 30 = 720$ hours.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour, so the total number of widgets it can produce in a month is $60 \cdot 720 = 43,200$ widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour, so the total number of widgets it can produce in a month is $45 \cdot 720 = 32,400$ widgets.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine:

The price of each widget is $6. Therefore, the total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000 is $43,200 \cdot 6 = 259,200$ dollars.

The total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 is $32,400 \cdot 6 = 194,400$ dollars.

Now, let's find the difference in revenue:

$259,200 - 194,400 = 64,800$

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To determine the cost of Cameron's stay at the hotel, we need to consider the two available options: the 24-hour stay and the 12-hour stay with additional hours.

Let's denote the cost of the 24-hour stay as $C_{24}$ and the cost of the 12-hour stay with additional hours as $C_{12}$. The cost of the 24-hour stay is given as 1600 pesos, so $C_{24} = 1600$.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos, and Cameron needs to pay an additional 70 pesos for every hour beyond the 12-hour mark. Since Cameron stays for 17 hours, he needs to pay for 5 additional hours, which amounts to $5 \times 70 = 350$ pesos. Therefore, the cost of the 12-hour stay with additional hours is $C_{12} = 1000 + 350 = 1350$ pesos.

To find the amount Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour stay with additional hours over the 24-hour stay, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour stay with additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour stay: $C_{24} - C_{12} = 1600 - 1350 = 250$ pesos.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To determine the total amount of hay needed, we must first calculate the amount each sheep requires. Since each goat needs 5 pounds of hay, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can express the amount each sheep needs as 2(5) - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay required for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{159}$"
"To determine the number of 25 dollar pens John can buy after his expenses, we need to calculate his net earnings and then subtract the cost of the pencils and gas.

First, let's calculate John's net earnings. His hourly wage is 50 dollars, and he worked for 6 hours, so his total earnings are:

50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

Next, we need to subtract the cost of gas and the deposit from his earnings. The cost of gas is 50 dollars, and the deposit is 100 dollars.

Net earnings = Total earnings - (Gas cost + Deposit)
= 300 - (50 + 100)
= 300 - 150
= 150 dollars

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pencils. John buys 5 pencils at 10 dollars each, so the total cost of the pencils is:

Cost of pencils = 5 * 10 dollars
= 50 dollars

After buying the pencils, John is left with:

Remaining money = Net earnings - Cost of pencils
= 150 - 50
= 100 dollars

Finally, we can determine the number of 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:

Number of pens = Remaining money / Cost of a pen
= 100 / 25
= 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Given that Craig and his brother take turns spelling out the longest letter words they know and counting the number of letters in those words, we can approach this problem by first calculating the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled. Since Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each, we can calculate this as follows:

Total number of letters in Craig's words = Number of words × Number of letters per word
= 20 × 15
= 300

Now, we are given that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled is:

Total number of letters in brother's words = Total number of letters in Craig's words + 50
= 300 + 50
= 350

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters in Craig's words and his brother's words:

Total number of letters = Total number of letters in Craig's words + Total number of letters in brother's words
= 300 + 350
= 650

The final answer is: $\boxed{650}$"
"To determine the total number of children participating in the drill, we can apply the principle of multiplication, specifically the associative property, to calculate the total number of children.

Let's break down the problem:

- Number of children in each row: 8
- Number of rows: 7
- Number of schools: 5

We can calculate the total number of children in one school by multiplying the number of children in each row by the number of rows: 8 * 7 = 56.

Now, to find the total number of children across all schools, we multiply the result by the number of schools: 56 * 5 = 280.

Therefore, the total number of children participating in the drill is 280.

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to calculate the total number of bottles given to the students and subtract that from the total number of bottles she obtained.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles given to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice. This can be represented as:

Total bottles given to students = Number of pupils × Bottles per pupil
= 29 × 2
= 58

Next, we need to find the total number of bottles the teacher obtained from redeeming her coupons. Each coupon is redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice, and she has 9 coupons. This can be represented as:

Total bottles obtained = Number of coupons × Bottles per coupon
= 9 × 100
= 900

Now, to find the number of bottles the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she obtained:

Bottles left = Total bottles obtained - Total bottles given to students
= 900 - 58
= 842

The final answer is: $\boxed{842}$"
"To determine the total amount Patty charged for the job, we need to calculate the labor cost, which is a function of the time spent on the job, and add it to the cost of parts and the visit fee.

The labor cost can be calculated using the formula:

Labor cost = Time spent × Hourly rate

Given that the job took 2.25 hours and the hourly rate is $35, we can substitute these values into the formula:

Labor cost = 2.25 hours × $35/hour
Labor cost = $78.75

In addition to the labor cost, we also need to consider the cost of parts, which is $60, and the visit fee, which is $40.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts + Visit fee
Total cost = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total cost = $178.75

Therefore, Patty charged a total of $178.75 for the job.

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To determine the amount James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs, the revenue generated from selling the unwanted CDs, and then find the difference between the two.

The original price of each CD is $15, and James purchased 10 CDs. Therefore, the total cost of the CDs is:

$$
\text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 15 = 150
$$

However, James received a 40% discount on the total cost. To find the amount of the discount, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (0.4):

$$
\text{Discount} = 0.4 \times 150 = 60
$$

The price James paid for the CDs after the discount is the total cost minus the discount:

$$
\text{Price Paid} = 150 - 60 = 90
$$

James decided to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each. The revenue generated from selling these CDs is:

$$
\text{Revenue} = 5 \times 40 = 200
$$

To find the amount James was out, we subtract the price he paid for the CDs from the revenue generated from selling the unwanted CDs:

$$
\text{Amount Out} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Price Paid} = 200 - 90 = 110
$$

Therefore, James was out $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To determine the total earnings from Jen's root crops, we need to calculate the revenue generated from each type of crop and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the yams. The price per yam is $1.5, and Jen has 6 yams. Therefore, the revenue from yams is given by the product of the price per yam and the number of yams: $1.5 \times 6 = $9.

Next, we calculate the revenue from the sweet potatoes. The price per sweet potato is $2, and Jen has 10 sweet potatoes. Thus, the revenue from sweet potatoes is $2 \times 10 = $20.

Lastly, we determine the revenue from the carrots. The price per carrot is $1.25, and Jen has 4 carrots. Therefore, the revenue from carrots is $1.25 \times 4 = $5.

To find the total earnings, we sum the revenues from each type of root crop: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To determine the time it took James to swim across the lake, we can break down the problem into three distinct segments: the initial swimming segment, the resting period, and the final swimming segment.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to swim 60% of the 20-mile lake. The distance covered in this segment is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. Given James' swimming speed of 2 miles per hour, the time taken for this segment is:

$$t_1 = \frac{d_1}{v} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}$$

After completing the initial 12 miles, James rests for half the time it took him to swim this distance, which is $t_1/2 = 6/2 = 3$ hours.

The remaining distance to be covered is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. Since James swims at half his initial speed of 2 miles per hour for this segment, his speed is now 1 mile per hour. The time taken to cover the remaining distance is:

$$t_3 = \frac{d_3}{v} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}$$

The total time taken by James to cross the lake is the sum of the time taken for the initial swimming segment, the resting period, and the time taken for the final swimming segment:

$$t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we can start by identifying the initial quantity of bread Sam had last Friday. Given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread, we can then calculate seven times this amount to find the quantity the bakery has.

Mathematically, this can be represented as 7 * 70. 

7 * 70 = 490

However, the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had. To find the bakery's total, we subtract 40 from the result of 7 * 70.

490 - 40 = 450

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final answer is: 450"
"To determine the number of stickers Jasmine has at the end, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. Initially, Jasmine was given 15 stickers for participating in class. However, she lost 7 stickers during playtime, resulting in a net loss of 7 stickers. This can be represented as:

15 (initial stickers) - 7 (stickers lost) = 8

Subsequently, her teacher awarded her 5 additional stickers for helping her classmates. This can be represented as:

8 (stickers remaining) + 5 (stickers awarded) = 13

Therefore, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

13"
"To determine the total commission earned by Cayley from the sales of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, we can calculate the commission from each publication separately and then sum the results.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times. The formula for commission is given by:

Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100

For the New York Times:
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%

Commission from New York Times = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
= (6 * 50) / 100
= 300 / 100
= $3

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%

Commission from Wall Street Journal = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
= (10 * 120) / 100
= 1200 / 100
= $12

Now, we can find the total commission by summing the commissions from both publications:
Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
= $3 + $12
= $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine Leo's age, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote Leo's age as L, Marcus's age as M, and Deanna's age as D.

Given that Deanna is 26 years old, we have D = 26.

We are also given that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so we can express this as M = D - 5. Substituting the value of D, we get M = 26 - 5 = 21.

Furthermore, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age, which can be expressed as M = 0.5L. Substituting the value of M, we get 21 = 0.5L.

To solve for L, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, resulting in 2 * 21 = L, which simplifies to L = 42.

Therefore, Leo's age is 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D.

We are given that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 

We can express these equations as:

B - A = 20  ... (Equation 1)
B - D = 10  ... (Equation 2)

We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so we can write the equation:

A + B + D = 45

We can substitute B = A + 20 into this equation to get:

A + (A + 20) + D = 45

Combine like terms:

2A + D + 20 = 45

Subtract 20 from both sides:

2A + D = 25

Now, we can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation A + B + D = 45 to get:

A + (D + 10) + D = 45

Combine like terms:

A + 2D + 10 = 45

Subtract 10 from both sides:

A + 2D = 35

Now we have two equations:

2A + D = 25
A + 2D = 35

We can multiply the second equation by 2 to get:

2A + 4D = 70

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate A:

(2A + 4D) - (2A + D) = 70 - 25

This simplifies to:

3D = 45

Divide both sides by 3:

D = 15

Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation A + 2D = 35 to get:

A + 2(15) = 35

A + 30 = 35

Subtract 30 from both sides:

A = 5

Now that we know A = 5, we can substitute A = 5 into the equation B = A + 20 to get:

B = 5 + 20

B = 25

The points scored by Azibo is A, which is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the paper density and the printing configuration. Given that each paper is printed on both sides, we can calculate the total number of pages per inch by multiplying the number of pages per inch by 2.

Let's denote the number of pages per inch as $p$. Since each paper is printed on both sides, the total number of pages per inch is $2p$. We are given that $2p = 200$ pages per inch.

Now, we can solve for $p$ by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2p &= 200 \\
p &= \frac{200}{2} \\
p &= 100
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can calculate the total number of pages in the book by multiplying the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Total pages} &= p \times \text{thickness} \\
&= 100 \times 1.5 \\
&= 150
\end{aligned}
$$

However, this calculation assumes that the pages are not counted twice, which is not the case since each page is printed on both sides. Therefore, we need to multiply the result by 2 to account for the double-sided printing:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Total pages} &= 2 \times 150 \\
&= 300
\end{aligned}
$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, which is a duration of 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

15 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know that Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we can divide 900 by 15:

900 minutes ÷ 15 minutes/set = 60 sets

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 60 sets of 15 minutes, we can calculate the total number of reports stapled as follows:

30 reports/set × 60 sets = 1800 reports

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1800}$"
"To determine the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim's usual sleep schedule is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying 8 hours by 60 minutes per hour: 8 × 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her wake-up time is 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m. This means her actual sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m.

To find the actual sleep duration, we can calculate the time difference between 10 p.m. and 5:55 a.m. We can convert 10 p.m. to a 24-hour clock: 10 p.m. = 22:00. The time difference is 22:00 to 05:55, which is 7 hours and 55 minutes. Converting this to minutes, we get 7 × 60 + 55 = 455 minutes.

Since she was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes, we subtract this from her actual sleep duration: 455 - 23 = 432 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{432}$"
"To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we first need to establish the initial quantities of measuring cups and spoons. Given that Jonathan has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of cups as follows:

2 dozen = 2 × 12 = 24 cups

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can express this relationship as a ratio. To find the number of spoons, we multiply the number of cups by 2/3:

24 cups × (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, we can calculate the remaining number of spoons by subtracting 6 from the initial quantity:

16 spoons - 6 spoons = 10 spoons

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we sum the remaining spoons and cups:

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

The final numerical answer is: 34"
"To determine the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the initial number of occupied beds. Given that 1/5 of the hospital's 1000 beds are occupied, we can express this as a fraction of the total capacity.

$$\frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200$$

Since 1/5 of the beds are occupied, 4/5 of the beds are unoccupied. We can calculate this as follows:

$$\frac{4}{5} \times 1000 = 800$$

Next, we need to calculate the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks, considering that 50 patients are admitted each day. With 14 days in 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted is:

$$50 \times 14 = 700$$

Adding the initial number of occupied beds to the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks gives us the total number of occupied beds:

$$200 + 700 = 900$$

Finally, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds:

$$1000 - 900 = 100$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to find the number of non-work emails. Since Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work-related, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Next, we are told that two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family. This can be represented as (2/3) * 9 = 6 emails to family.

Now, we need to find the number of non-work emails that are not to family. This is simply 9 - 6 = 3 emails.

Finally, we are informed that one-third of the remaining non-work emails are to her boyfriend. This can be calculated as (1/3) * 3 = 1 email.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine Shawna's father's age, we can establish a series of relationships between the individuals' ages. Let's denote Aliya's age as A, Shawna's age as S, and Shawna's father's age as F.

Given that Aliya is 3 years old, we can express Shawna's age as S = 3A. Since we know Aliya's age, we can substitute A = 3 into the equation to find Shawna's age: S = 3(3) = 9 years.

Now, we are given that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. This relationship can be expressed as F = 5S. Substituting the value of S, we get F = 5(9) = 45 years.

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the percentage of the number reported by Courtney that represents the actual attendance. Since Kelly stated that Courtney overestimated the number of people in attendance by 20%, we can express this as a percentage decrease.

Let x be the actual number of people who attended the concert. We can set up the equation:

48 = x + (20% of x)

To find 20% of x, we multiply x by 0.20:

48 = x + 0.20x

Combine like terms:

48 = 1.20x

Now, divide both sides by 1.20 to solve for x:

x = 48 / 1.20

x = 40

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's analyze the given problem. We are told that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. If we denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as x, then Jason carried 2x balls, and Jordan carried 4x balls.

We are also given that Jason carried 2 balls. Since Jason carried 2x balls, we can set up the equation 2x = 2 and solve for x.

2x = 2
x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the total number of balls by substituting x into the equation for the total number of balls carried by the three boys: x + 2x + 4x = 7x.

Total number of balls = 7x
Total number of balls = 7 * 1
Total number of balls = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we can start by calculating the total number of holes at the end of the third day. The pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day, but they filled in 2 holes. Therefore, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is given by:

10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes

We are told that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day:

40 - 29 = 11 holes

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is 11.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"Given that Amora and Lainey received an equal number of corn chips, denoted as x, and Collins received 15 more corn chips than each of them, we can establish the following equation:

x + x + (x + 15) = Total

Since we know that Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, we can substitute x = 70 into the equation:

70 + 70 + (70 + 15) = Total

Combine like terms:

140 + 85 = Total

Simplify the expression:

225 = Total

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is 225.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To determine the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. This can be achieved by finding 50% of the cost of supplies and then adding it to the original cost.

First, we calculate 50% of the cost of supplies, which is equivalent to 0.5 times the cost of supplies. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200

Next, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel:

Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + (50% of cost of supplies)
               = $400 + $200
               = $600

Therefore, the cost of travel is $600."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L.

We are given that the total number of Pokémon caught is 339, so we can write the equation A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, which can be expressed as L = S + 5.

Furthermore, we are told that Stan has caught 13 fewer Pokémon than 4 times the number caught by Adelwolfe, which can be written as S = 4A - 13.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.
A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Next, we can substitute the third equation into the previous one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.
A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.

Combining like terms, we get 9A - 21 = 339.

Adding 21 to both sides, we obtain 9A = 360.

Dividing both sides by 9, we find A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"To determine the total time John will spend watching the show, we need to calculate the number of episodes and then multiply it by the length of each episode.

Given that each episode is 20 minutes long, we can denote the number of episodes as 'n'. According to the problem, there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. This can be expressed as:

n = 20 / 2
n = 10

Now, we can calculate the total time spent watching the show by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

Total time = n * 20
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200 minutes

Therefore, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we can utilize the concept of displacement, which is a fundamental principle in kinematics. Displacement is the change in position of an object with respect to a reference frame, and it is a vector quantity.

Let's break down the bird's journey into three segments:

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
2. The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
3. The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.

We can calculate the displacement in each segment by multiplying the speed by the time. However, since the bird is flying in opposite directions, we need to consider the net displacement.

Displacement in the first segment = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles (south)
Displacement in the second segment = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles (north)
Displacement in the third segment = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles (south)

The net displacement is the sum of the displacements in the southerly direction minus the displacement in the northerly direction.

Net displacement = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Net displacement = 374 miles

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta received. We can start by converting the mixed numbers and fractions into a common unit for easier calculation. 

1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies is equivalent to 12 brownies.
1/2 dozen brownies is equivalent to 6 brownies.
4 dozen brownies is equivalent to 48 brownies.

Now, we can add these values together to find the total number of brownies received:

Total brownies received = 12 + 6 + 48
= 66

Next, we need to calculate the number of brownies eaten. 1 1/2 dozen brownies is equivalent to 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

Now, we can subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received to find the number of brownies left over:

Total brownies left over = Total brownies received - brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48

Therefore, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total age of all three family members, we can start by identifying the age of Nani's brother. Since his brother is twice Nani's age, we can express this relationship as:

Brother's age = 2 × Nani's age
Brother's age = 2 × 8
Brother's age = 16

Next, we need to find the age of Nani's sister, who is 25% younger than Nani. This can be represented as:

Sister's age = Nani's age × (1 - 0.25)
Sister's age = 8 × 0.75
Sister's age = 6

Now that we have the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister, we can calculate the total age of the family members by summing their individual ages:

Total age = Nani's age + Brother's age + Sister's age
Total age = 8 + 16 + 6
Total age = 30

Therefore, the total age of all three family members is 30 years."
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of racquets by the time it takes to string each type of racquet.

For synthetic gut racquets, the time is calculated as follows: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes.

For polyester string racquets, the time is calculated as follows: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes.

For hybrid racquets, the time is calculated as follows: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the time for each type of racquet together: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is 227 minutes.

The final answer is: 227"
"To determine the total cost of the phones, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining two phones.

Let's denote the price of the first two phones as P. Since each phone after the first two is half price, the price of the remaining two phones will be P/2.

Given that the price of each phone is $600, we can set up the equation:

P = $600

The cost of the first two phones is 2P, which is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The cost of the remaining two phones is P/2, which is $600/2 = $300. Since there are two phones, the total cost for the remaining phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

The total cost for all four phones is the sum of the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining two phones: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To determine the total number of players in both teams, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. Given that Carlton's team has 13 players, and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Let's denote the number of players in Zeke's team as Z and the number of players in Carlton's team as C. We are given that C = 13. We also know that Z = C + 7.

Substituting the value of C into the equation for Z, we get Z = 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players in Zeke's team (Z) to the number of players in Carlton's team (C): Z + C = 20 + 13 = 33.

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams is 33.

The final answer is: 33"
"To determine the total number of wooden slats required for the rectangular fence, we must first calculate the perimeter of the garden. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

P = 2(l + w)

where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Given that the length (l) of the garden is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(15 + 10)
P = 2(25)
P = 50 feet

Since Robert requires 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we can calculate the total number of slats needed by multiplying the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = 2P
Total slats needed = 2(50)
Total slats needed = 100

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats to complete the fence.

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we calculate the total number of boxes she had initially. Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. Then, she gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, resulting in a total of 4 boxes given away. Therefore, she had 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges in 8 boxes is 8 \* 20 = 160 oranges.

Next, we need to find out how many oranges she kept. Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges. To calculate this, we multiply the total number of oranges by 1/4: 1/4 \* 160 = 40 oranges.

Now, to find the number of oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total number of states in both the United States and India, we first need to establish the number of states in each country. The United States has a well-documented 50 states, which is a widely accepted figure.

India, on the other hand, has a more complex administrative division system. However, for the purpose of this calculation, we can rely on the commonly cited figure of 29 states in India. This number is derived from the fact that India has 4 more states than half the number of states in the United States. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

India's states = (1/2) * USA's states + 4
India's states = (1/2) * 50 + 4
India's states = 25 + 4
India's states = 29

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries, we can simply add the number of states in the United States and India:

Total states = USA's states + India's states
Total states = 50 + 29
Total states = 79

The final answer is: 79"
"To determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to purchase. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Therefore, the total cost of the items is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Given that Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5). This can be expressed as:

$$\frac{\text{Amount needed to earn}}{\text{Hourly wage}} = \frac{\$25}{\$5}$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$\frac{\$25}{\$5} = 5$$

Therefore, Tyler needs to work for 5 hours to afford his books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use basic algebraic reasoning. Let's denote the number of cherries Jerry has as $J$, the number of cherries Richard has as $R$, and the total number of cherries as $T$. We are given that $T = 60$, $R = 30$, and $R = J + 10$.

We can express the relationship between the number of cherries each person has as an equation: $R + J + T = 60$. Substituting the given values, we get $30 + J + 60 = 60$. Simplifying this equation, we get $J = 30$.

Now that we know Jerry has 30 cherries, we can find the difference between the number of cherries Robert and Jerry have. Since Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 30 cherries, the difference is $R - J = 30 - 30 = 0$. However, we are given that Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, not Jerry. Therefore, we need to find the difference between the number of cherries Robert and Richard have.

We already know that Richard has 20 cherries. The difference between the number of cherries Robert and Richard have is $R - R = 30 - 20 = 10$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total earnings from the fundraiser, we need to calculate the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both Saturday and Sunday.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

Given that Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday, we have G = 10.

We also know that the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday is 4 fewer than the number sold on Sunday. Therefore, A = Sunday's apple pie - 4.

On Sunday, the number of boxes of gingerbread sold is 5 more than on Saturday, which is G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

Since we know the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday is 15, we can find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday by subtracting 4 from Sunday's total: A = 15 - 4 = 11.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

The total earnings on Saturday are given by the sum of the earnings from gingerbread and apple pie sales: (G * 6) + (A * 15) = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225.

The total earnings on Sunday are given by the sum of the earnings from gingerbread and apple pie sales: (Sunday's gingerbread * 6) + (Sunday's apple pie * 15) = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315.

The total earnings for the two days are the sum of the earnings on Saturday and Sunday: 225 + 315 = 540.

The final answer is: $\boxed{540}$"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need for her 8-day vacation, we must first calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use. Given that she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day.

The total number of times she will reapply sunscreen over the 8-day period is 4 applications/day * 8 days = 32 applications.

Since each application requires 1 ounce of sunscreen, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is 32 ounces.

To find the number of bottles needed, we divide the total amount of sunscreen required (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 oz / 8 oz/bottle = 4 bottles

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Given that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we can express this relationship as a mathematical equation. Let's denote the price of the blue car as B and the price of the red car as R. We are also given that the price of the blue car is $100.

The relationship between the two prices can be expressed as:

R = B - 0.4B

Simplifying the equation, we get:

R = 0.6B

Now, we can substitute the given value of B into the equation to find the price of the red car:

R = 0.6 * 100
R = 60

Therefore, the price of the red car is $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we simply add their prices:

Total cost = B + R
= 100 + 60
= 160

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's analyze the given information to determine the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother.

Given that Emil is currently 19 years old, we can establish the following relationships:

1. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This implies that his dad's age at that time will be twice Emil's age, which is 24 * 2 = 48 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means his brother's age at that time will be half of Emil's age, which is 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

To find the current age of Emil's dad, we subtract the number of years until Emil turns 24 from his age at that time: 48 - 5 = 43 years old. Similarly, to find the current age of Emil's brother, we subtract the number of years until Emil turns 24 from his age at that time: 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total number of beads Adrianne has, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. Let's break down the information provided:

- Her mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
- Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which is 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
- Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which is 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

To find the total number of beads, we can add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend: 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.

Therefore, Adrianne has a total of 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and then sum these values. 

Let's denote the amount of crawfish Joe caught on Thursday as $T$, Friday as $F$, and Saturday as $S$. We are given that $T = 3$ pounds. 

On Friday, Joe caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, so $F = 4T = 4(3) = 12$ pounds. 

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is $S = \frac{1}{2}F = \frac{1}{2}(12) = 6$ pounds.

Now, we can find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught by summing the amounts from each day: $T + F + S = 3 + 12 + 6 = 21$ pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: $\frac{21}{3} = 7$.

The final numerical answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we first need to identify the number of football players in the class. Given that 20% of the class are football players, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we need to find the number of students who are not football players. This is simply the total number of students minus the number of football players:

30 students - 6 students = 24 students.

Now, we are told that 25% of the remaining students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. We can calculate this as follows:

25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders or band members:

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie, we need to calculate the arithmetic mean of their shoe sizes. 

Let's denote Sophie's shoe size as S and Charlie's shoe size as C. We are given that C = 5S. Since Sophie's shoe size is 5, we can substitute S = 5 into the equation for Charlie's shoe size: C = 5(5) = 25.

Now, we can calculate the average shoe size by finding the arithmetic mean of S and C: (S + C) / 2 = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

Therefore, the average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to consider the total length of the bed and the space required for each plant. The flower bed is 111 feet long, and Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the bed to inches: 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Let's denote the number of plants as 'n'. The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is 1332 - 18n - 12n = 1320 - 30n inches.

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 'n - 17' more flowers. The total cost of the flowers will be the number of flowers she needs to buy multiplied by the cost of each flower, which is (n - 17) * 6.

We can set up the equation: 12n = 1320 - 30n. To solve for 'n', we can add 30n to both sides of the equation: 42n = 1320. Then, we can divide both sides by 42: n = 1320 / 42 = 31.4286. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 31 plants.

Now that we know Pat needs 31 - 17 = 14 more flowers, we can calculate the total cost: (n - 17) * 6 = 14 * 6 = 84.

The final answer is: $84"
"To determine the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to calculate his daily consumption. Since he eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, who consumes 18 pretzels per day, we can express this relationship as a fraction.

Let x be the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Then, we have:

x = 1/2 * 18

To solve for x, we can multiply 18 by 1/2, which is equivalent to dividing 18 by 2.

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Now that we know Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels per day, we can calculate his weekly consumption by multiplying this value by 7, the number of days in a week.

Weekly consumption = 9 * 7
Weekly consumption = 63

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"To determine the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then sum them.

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias. The number of petunias required is 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket = 15 petunias. Given that each petunia costs $3.00, the total cost of petunias is 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

Next, we calculate the cost of sweet potato vines. The number of vines required is 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket = 10 vines. Given that each vine costs $2.50, the total cost of sweet potato vines is 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

The total cost of filling the hanging baskets is the sum of the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines, which is $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To determine the number of roses that Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

The soil requirements for each type of flower are as follows:

- Sunflowers: 3 pounds per flower
- Carnations: 1.5 pounds per flower

Given that they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds. For 10 carnations, the total soil used is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

The total soil used for both sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, the amount of soil left for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Given that each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of pairs of shoes Jessica can purchase in a year, we first need to calculate her monthly savings. Given that she sets aside 25% of her monthly income, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 25 by 100, resulting in 0.25. 

We then multiply this decimal by her monthly income of $2,000.00 to find her monthly savings: $2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate her annual savings by multiplying her monthly savings by 12: $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

Now, we can determine the number of pairs of shoes she can purchase by dividing her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes, which is $1,000.00: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider the rates at which she performs these tasks. 

Let's denote the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp as $t_p$ and the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp as $t_c$. We know that Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, so the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp is given by $t_p = \frac{90}{6} = 15$ minutes.

Similarly, we know that she can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp is given by $t_c = \frac{90}{30} \cdot 10 = 30$ minutes.

Since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, the total time it takes to complete both tasks is the maximum of $t_p$ and $t_c$. In this case, the maximum time is $t_c = 30$ minutes.

Therefore, the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

Let's denote the initial temperature as T. The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. The total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees. 

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. The total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours. The room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a combination of algebra and basic arithmetic operations. Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as x.

We know that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. This implies that Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can infer that 75 years have passed between the two instances when Bill saw the comet. Therefore, the difference in Bill's age between the two instances is 90 - x.

We also know that the difference in Bill's age between the two instances is equal to the time elapsed between the two instances, which is 75 years. This can be expressed as:

90 - x = 75

To solve for x, we can isolate the variable by subtracting 90 from both sides of the equation:

-x = -15

Multiplying both sides by -1 gives us:

x = 15

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we can break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum the results.

Buford writes a check for his electric bill once per month, which translates to 12 checks per year, as there are 12 months in a year. Similarly, he writes a check for his gas bill once per month, resulting in 12 checks per year.

For the church, Buford writes two checks per month, which is equivalent to 24 checks per year. This is calculated by multiplying the monthly frequency (2 checks) by the number of months in a year (12).

Lastly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which means he writes 4 checks per year. This is calculated by dividing the number of months in a year (12) by the frequency of the quarterly payments (3).

To find the total number of checks, we can sum the results:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52}$"
"To determine the number of flights to France, we need to first calculate the total number of flights made by the first plane. Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, we can set up the equation:

x / 2 = 44

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

x = 88

Now that we know the total number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the number of flights to Greece. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is:

(3/4)x = (3/4)(88) = 66

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is:

(1/2)(x - 66) = (1/2)(88 - 66) = (1/2)(22) = 11

Therefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we can calculate their individual howling times and then sum them. 

Let's denote the howling time of Tobias as $t_T$, Chikote as $t_C$, and Igneous as $t_I$. We are given that $t_T = 20$ seconds. Since Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, we have $t_C = 2t_T = 2(20) = 40$ seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so $t_I = t_T + t_C = 20 + 40 = 60$ seconds.

Now, we can calculate the total howling time by summing the individual times: $t_{\text{total}} = t_T + t_C + t_I = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120$ seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): $t_{\text{total}} = \frac{120}{60} = 2$ minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

Let's denote the amount of money Adam's father gave him as $x. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, we can express this relationship as x = 2 * 6, where 6 is the amount his mother gave him.

Solving for x, we get x = 2 * 6 = 12.

Now, we know that Adam's mother gave him $6 and his father gave him $12. The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is the sum of these two amounts: 6 + 12 = 18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we can calculate the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings by subtracting the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: 30 - 18 = 12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the total age of the children as the sum of their individual ages. Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. We are given that the total age of the children is 20, and we know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro.

The total age of the children can be expressed as:
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
3 + 4 + Helene's age + W = 20

We are also given that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. Therefore, the average age is (3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4.

Helene's age is twice the average age, so we can write the equation as:
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
4 * Helene's age = 2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)
Expanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get:
4 * Helene's age = 14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W
Subtracting 2 * Helene's age from both sides, we get:
2 * Helene's age = 14 + 2W
Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get:
2 * Helene's age - 14 = 2W
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
Helene's age - 7 = W

Now we can substitute Helene's age in the first equation:
3 + 4 + (Helene's age) + W = 20
7 + (Helene's age) + W = 20
Substituting Helene's age - 7 for W, we get:
7 + (Helene's age - 7) + (Helene's age - 7) = 20
Simplifying the equation, we get:
Helene's age + Helene's age - 14 = 20
2 * Helene's age - 14 = 20
Adding 14 to both sides, we get:
2 * Helene's age = 34
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
Helene's age = 17

Now that we know Helene's age, we can substitute it back into the equation Helene's age - 7 = W:
17 - 7 = W
W = 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Let's denote the amount collected from the neighbors as $N and the amount collected from the online fund as $F. We are given that N = $500 and F = $1500.

The total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund is the sum of N and F, which is N + F = $500 + $1500 = $2000.

However, we are also told that Walter's friend donates $200, but this amount is not included in the amount that the lawyer will multiply by 3. Therefore, the amount the lawyer will multiply by 3 is still $2000.

The lawyer will donate 3 times this amount, which is 3 × $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To determine the number of people in the church next door, we can follow a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception by the 100 guests. This is given by the product of the number of guests and the number of cookies each guest brought, which is $100 \times 15 = 1500$ cookies.

Next, we are told that the bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is $1500 \times \frac{1}{2} = 750$ cookies.

Now, we know that each person in the church received 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received. This gives us:

$$\frac{750}{15} = 50$$

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is 50.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, let's consider the total watermelon as a unit of 100. 

Let's denote the amount of watermelon each kid gets as x. Since each adult receives twice as much as each kid, the amount each adult gets is 2x.

The total amount of watermelon given to the kids is 4x (4 kids * x units each), and the total amount given to the adults is 2x (2 adults * 2x units each). 

Since the total watermelon is 100 units, we can set up the equation: 4x + 2x = 100.

Combining like terms, we get 6x = 100.

Dividing both sides by 6, we find x = 100/6 = 16.67.

Now that we know each kid gets 16.67 units, each adult gets 2x = 2 * 16.67 = 33.33 units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (33.33 / 100) * 100 = 33.33%.

Therefore, each adult gets 33.33% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{33.33}$"
"To determine the time available for updating records, we must first calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments. The time spent on rounds can be calculated as follows:

Time spent on rounds = Number of inpatients * Time per inpatient
= 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient
= 180 minutes

Similarly, the time spent on appointments can be calculated as follows:

Time spent on appointments = Number of appointments * Time per appointment
= 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment
= 300 minutes

The total time spent on rounds and appointments is the sum of these two values:

Total time spent = Time spent on rounds + Time spent on appointments
= 180 minutes + 300 minutes
= 480 minutes

To convert this total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Total time spent (hours) = Total time spent (minutes) / 60
= 480 minutes / 60
= 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours, the time available for updating records is the difference between his total work hours and the time spent on rounds and appointments:

Time available for updating records = Total work hours - Total time spent
= 9 hours - 8 hours
= 1 hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete the process. This involves adding the time to make the cake batter, bake the cake, cool the cake, and frost the cake.

The time to make the cake batter is 20 minutes, the time to bake the cake is 30 minutes, the time to cool the cake is 2 hours (which is equivalent to 120 minutes), and the time to frost the cake is 10 minutes. 

The total time required to make the cake is the sum of these individual times:
\[ \text{Total Time} = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
\[ \text{Total Time (hours)} = \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time required from the desired serving time to find the latest start time. 

Let's denote the latest start time as $t$. Then, the equation becomes:
\[ t + 3 = 5 \]

Solving for $t$, we get:
\[ t = 5 - 3 \]
\[ t = 2 \]

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
$$
\frac{8x}{8} = \frac{64}{8}
$$
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from renting the studio and the total revenue generated from student fees.

First, let's calculate the total number of sessions in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, and the studio is rented 3 days a week, the total number of sessions in a month is 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total revenue per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month. Therefore, the total revenue per month is $40 * 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we can use basic algebraic reasoning and division to determine the number of chocolate bars in each box for both Peter and Martha.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as 'x'. Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, the total number of chocolate bars he has is 4x. Similarly, since Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, the total number of chocolate bars she has is 7x.

We are given that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:

4x = 64 (for Peter)
7x = 56 (for Martha)

To find the value of 'x', we can solve each equation separately. 

For Peter: 4x = 64
x = 64 / 4
x = 16

For Martha: 7x = 56
x = 56 / 7
x = 8

Now that we have the value of 'x', we can find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the population of porcupines in the park after a year, we first need to calculate the number of female porcupines, as they are the ones giving birth to the offspring. The proportion of female porcupines in the population is 3/5, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.6.

Number of female porcupines = 0.6 * 50 = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

The total number of porcupines after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the number of babies born. This can be expressed as:

Total porcupines after a year = Initial population + (Number of female porcupines * Number of babies per female per year)
= 50 + (30 * 48)
= 50 + 1440
= 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To determine the cost of filling the Smith family's swimming pool, we must first calculate the volume of the pool. Given the dimensions of the pool (width = 14 feet, length = 25 feet, and depth = 4 feet), we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

V = lwh

where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth, in this case).

V = (14 ft)(25 ft)(4 ft)
V = 1400 cubic feet

However, the pool company requires us to multiply the volume by 5.9 to obtain the number of gallons of water needed. This is likely due to the fact that 1 cubic foot of water is equivalent to approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, we can convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons by multiplying by 7.48:

Gallons = V * 7.48
Gallons = 1400 * 7.48
Gallons ≈ 10472 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of filling the pool by multiplying the number of gallons by the cost per gallon ($0.10):

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 10472 * 0.10
Cost ≈ 1047.20

The final answer is: $1047.20"
"To determine the total number of sticks, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of red sticks as R, blue sticks as B, and yellow sticks as Y.

We are given that there are 9 red sticks, so R = 9. We also know that there are 5 more blue sticks than red, which can be expressed as B = R + 5. Substituting the value of R, we get B = 9 + 5 = 14.

Furthermore, we are told that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, which can be written as Y = B - 3. Substituting the value of B, we get Y = 14 - 3 = 11.

To find the total number of sticks, we can add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: R + B + Y = 9 + 14 + 11.

The total number of sticks is therefore 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the difference in the distances traveled by Matteo and Shandy, we can utilize the formula for distance, which is given by the product of speed and time.

Let's calculate the distance traveled by each individual:

Matteo's distance = speed × time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's distance = speed × time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we can find the difference in their distances by subtracting Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance:

Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

The final answer is: $\boxed{230}$"
"To determine the number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into manageable parts. Let's start by identifying the total number of students and the proportions of students over and under 16 years old.

Given that the school enrolls 3000 students, we can calculate the number of students over 16 as follows:

$$\text{Students over 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500$$

Next, we need to find the number of male students over 16. Since one-fourth of the students over 16 are male, we can calculate this as:

$$\text{Male students over 16} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375$$

Now, we can find the number of female students over 16 by subtracting the number of male students over 16 from the total number of students over 16:

$$\text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125$$

Moving on to the students under 16, we know that half of the total students are under 16, so:

$$\text{Students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500$$

Since one-half of the students under 16 are male, we can calculate the number of male students under 16 as:

$$\text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750$$

Finally, we can find the number of female students under 16 by subtracting the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16:

$$\text{Female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750$$

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16:

$$\text{Total female students} = 1125 + 750 = 1875$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of laps Bethany and Quinn can run, we need to analyze the given information step by step.

Let's denote the number of laps each person can run as follows:
- Bethany: B = 10 laps
- Trey: T = B + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14 laps
- Shaelyn: S = T / 2 = 14 / 2 = 7 laps
- Quinn: Q = S - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5 laps

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of laps Bethany and Quinn can run. This can be calculated as B - Q = 10 - 5 = 5 laps.

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

Let's denote the capacity of the tank as C = 18000 gallons. On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is (1/4)C = (1/4)(18000) = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped (3/4)(4500) = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is (2/3)(4500) = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is (1/3)(3375) = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is the sum of the water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on both days: (4500 + 3375) + (3000 + 1125) = 12000 gallons.

The amount of water remaining in the tank is the difference between the tank's capacity and the total amount of water pumped: C - 12000 = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can model the situation using a piecewise function, where the rate of charge loss changes at the 5-hour mark.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x. The charge remaining after 5 hours can be calculated as:

x - (9% of x) * 5
= x - 0.45x
= 0.55x

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, the charge remaining after 8 hours is:

0.55x - (7% of 0.55x) * 3
= 0.55x - 0.21x
= 0.34x

However, we are given that the final charge remaining is 28% of the initial charge. This means that the 34% remaining after 8 hours is reduced to 28% after the last 3 hours. To find the charge remaining after 8 hours, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the last 3 hours.

Let's denote the charge remaining after 8 hours as y. Then, the charge lost in the last 3 hours is y - 28% of x. We know that the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 34% - 28% = 6% of x.

So, we can set up the equation: y - 0.28x = 0.06x.

Solving for y, we get y = 0.34x.

Now, we know that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34% of the initial charge. We also know that the charge remaining after 5 hours is 55% of the initial charge. To find the initial charge, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the first 5 hours.

The charge lost in the first 5 hours is 55% - 34% = 21% of x.

So, we can set up the equation: x - 0.21x = 0.34x.

Simplifying the equation, we get 0.79x = 0.34x.

However, this equation is not correct. Let's re-evaluate the situation. The charge remaining after 5 hours is 55% of the initial charge, and the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34% of the initial charge. The charge lost in the first 5 hours is 55% - 34% = 21% of x.

So, we can set up the equation: x - 0.21x = 0.34x.

So, we can set up the equation: x - 0.55x = 0.34x - 0.28x.

Simplifying the equation, we get 0.21x = 0.06x.

However, this equation is still not correct. Let's re-evaluate the situation again. The charge remaining after 5 hours is 55% of the initial charge, and the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34% of the initial charge. The charge lost in the first 5 hours is 55% - 34% = 21% of x.

So, we can set up the equation: 0.55x - 0.34x = 0.21x.

"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save for the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15, resulting in a total hourly earnings of $25.

Given that she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:

Weekly Earnings = Hourly Earnings × Number of Hours Worked
= $25/hour × 40 hours/week
= $1000/week

Next, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. This can be calculated as follows:

Down Payment = 20% of $10,000
= 0.20 × $10,000
= $2000

Now, we can determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment by dividing the amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

Number of Weeks = Down Payment / Weekly Earnings
= $2000 / $1000
= 2

Therefore, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of plums Jamaar can purchase, we need to calculate the remaining funds after accounting for the cost of the fruits he has already acquired.

Let's begin by calculating the total expenditure on the fruits he has purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 \* $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 \* $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 \* $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 \* $0.75 = $3.75

The total cost of the fruits he has purchased is $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25.

Jamaar initially had $10, so we subtract the total cost of the fruits from his initial amount to find the remaining funds:

$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Now, we can determine the number of plums he can purchase by dividing the remaining funds by the cost of a plum:

$\frac{\$0.75}{\$0.25} = 3$

Therefore, Jamaar can purchase 3 plums.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we first need to calculate the total number of packs she gave away. Since she kept 2 packs out of 15, the number of packs given away is 15 - 2 = 13.

Now, we divide the total number of packs given away by the number of friends to find out how many packs each friend received. This can be expressed as:

Number of packs per friend = Total packs given away / Number of friends
= 13 / 10
= 1.3 packs

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, we can calculate the total number of pieces in 1.3 packs as follows:

Total pieces per pack = 60
Total pieces in 1.3 packs = 1.3 * 60
= 78

Therefore, each friend received 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the price of carrots after three years, we can utilize the concept of exponential growth, which is a common phenomenon in economics and finance. The price of carrots increases by 5% of the original price each year, indicating a geometric progression.

Let's denote the original price as P0 = $120. The price after one year can be calculated as P1 = P0 + (0.05 * P0) = $120 + $6 = $126. 

To find the price after two years, we can use the same formula: P2 = P1 + (0.05 * P1) = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

For the third year, we apply the same formula again: P3 = P2 + (0.05 * P2) = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: $139"
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies, we can start by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums to find the number of pictures in each album.

Let's denote the number of pictures in each album as x. Since Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and distributed them evenly across 8 albums, we can set up the equation:

72 = 8x

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

x = 72 / 8
x = 9

Now that we know there are 9 pictures in each album, we can find the number of selfies and portraits. Since 3 albums were selfies only, the number of selfies is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 albums - 3 selfies albums = 5 albums. 
The number of portraits is 5 albums * 9 pictures per album = 45 portraits.

However, we are given that 2 of the albums were portraits. This means that the 5 albums we calculated earlier include the 2 portrait albums and 3 other albums. Since the 2 portrait albums have 9 pictures each, the number of portraits in these albums is 2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits.

The number of portraits in the remaining 3 albums is 45 portraits - 18 portraits = 27 portraits.

The total number of portraits and selfies is 27 selfies + 27 portraits = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine the time James spends reading, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information. We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find the total time spent reading, we need to calculate the number of sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes to read one set.

Let's denote the total number of pages James reads as P and the time it takes to read one set of 3 pages as t. We are given that P = 18 pages and t = 10 minutes. Since James reads 3 pages per set, we can calculate the number of sets as P / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6 sets.

Now, we can find the total time spent reading by multiplying the number of sets by the time per set: 6 sets * 10 minutes/set = 60 minutes.

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we can apply a step-by-step approach to account for the check-ins and checkouts.

Initially, the hotel was fully booked with 100 guests.

24 guests elected an early checkout, resulting in a reduction of 24 guests. Therefore, the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

Subsequently, 15 guests opted for a late checkout, further reducing the number of guests to 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30. This increase in check-ins results in a total of 61 + 30 = 91 guests.

Finally, 7 more people checked in after dinner, leading to a total of 91 + 7 = 98 guests.

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the total number of bananas John has, we need to calculate the bananas he picked on each day and then sum them up.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas. This is a straightforward value.

On Thursday, John picked 6 bananas, which is another known quantity.

On Friday, John picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. To find this value, we multiply the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday by 3: 3 × 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas he picked on each day: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

Therefore, the total number of bananas John has is 22."
"To determine the number of points Aries is sure to get in the 60-item quiz, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, and then find out how many of each she is sure to get.

First, let's find the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:
- Total questions: $n = 60$
- Easy questions: $n_{easy} = 0.4n = 0.4 \times 60 = 24$
- Average and difficult questions: $n_{avg} + n_{diff} = n - n_{easy} = 60 - 24 = 36$
- Average questions: $n_{avg} = \frac{1}{2} \times (n_{avg} + n_{diff}) = \frac{1}{2} \times 36 = 18$
- Difficult questions: $n_{diff} = n_{avg} = 18$

Now, let's find out how many of each type of question Aries is sure to get:
- Easy questions: $n_{easy, Aries} = 0.75 \times n_{easy} = 0.75 \times 24 = 18$
- Average questions: $n_{avg, Aries} = 0.5 \times n_{avg} = 0.5 \times 18 = 9$
- Difficult questions: $n_{diff, Aries} = 0.5 \times n_{diff} = 0.5 \times 18 = 9$

Now, let's add up the number of questions Aries is sure to get:
$n_{total, Aries} = n_{easy, Aries} + n_{avg, Aries} + n_{diff, Aries} = 18 + 9 + 9 = 36$

"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'. We are given that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4 and the price of a large stuffed animal is three times that of a small one, which is $12.

We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can express this relationship as an equation: x = 2y.

We are also given that the total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. This can be expressed as the equation: 4x + 12y = 120.

Substituting the expression for x from the first equation into the second equation, we get: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we have: 8y + 12y = 120, which is equivalent to 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since x = 2y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches consumed by the family in one week, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of sandwiches consumed per day by the family. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches consumed per day is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11.

To find the total number of sandwiches consumed in one week, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week, which is 7. Thus, the total number of sandwiches consumed in one week is 11 * 7 = 77.

The final answer is: 77"
"To determine the amount of money Suzanne has left from her earnings, we need to calculate her total revenue and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate her revenue from selling cookies. Since she sold 80 cookies at $1 each, her revenue from cookies is given by the product of the number of cookies sold and the price per cookie:

$$\text{Revenue from cookies} = 80 \times 1 = \$80$$

Next, let's calculate her revenue from selling cupcakes. She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so her revenue from cupcakes is given by the product of the number of cupcakes sold and the price per cupcake:

$$\text{Revenue from cupcakes} = 60 \times 4 = \$240$$

Now, let's find her total revenue by adding her revenue from cookies and cupcakes:

$$\text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from cookies} + \text{Revenue from cupcakes} = \$80 + \$240 = \$320$$

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so the total amount she gave away is:

$$\text{Total amount given away} = 2 \times 10 = \$20$$

To find the amount of money Suzanne has left, we subtract the total amount she gave away from her total revenue:

$$\text{Amount left} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total amount given away} = \$320 - \$20 = \$300$$

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of eggs found by the friends, we can utilize a simple subtraction approach. Given that the Smith twins each found 30 eggs, their combined total is 60 eggs. Additionally, 10 eggs remained unfound. 

Let's denote the total number of eggs as E, the number of eggs found by the Smith twins as S, and the number of eggs found by the friends as F. We can express the relationship between these variables as:

E = S + F + 10

Substituting the known values, we have:

100 = 60 + F + 10

To isolate F, we'll subtract 70 from both sides of the equation:

F = 100 - 70
F = 30

Therefore, the friends found 30 eggs.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days, we need to calculate the daily ore production per dwarf and then scale it up to the total number of dwarves and days.

First, let's establish the daily ore production per dwarf with a steel pickaxe. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pounds per day. 

Using a steel pickaxe, his production increases by 50% compared to the iron pickaxe. This 50% increase is equivalent to 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. Therefore, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Now, we can calculate the total daily ore production for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes: 40 dwarves * 36 pounds/dwarf/day = 1440 pounds/day.

To find the total ore production for a month with 30 days, we multiply the daily production by the number of days: 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = 43200 pounds.

The final numerical answer is: 43200"
"Given that the prices of the sandwiches are proportional, we can establish a ratio of price to the number of sandwiches for each package. Let's denote the price of the first package as $3 for 2 sandwiches, and the price of the second package as $6 for 4 sandwiches.

We can express the price per sandwich for each package as follows:

For the first package: $\frac{3}{2}$ dollars per sandwich
For the second package: $\frac{6}{4}$ dollars per sandwich

Simplifying the ratios, we get:

For the first package: $\frac{3}{2}$ dollars per sandwich
For the second package: $\frac{3}{2}$ dollars per sandwich

Since the ratios are the same, the price of the third package with 8 sandwiches will be proportional to the price of the second package. To find the price per sandwich, we divide the price by the number of sandwiches:

$\frac{6}{4} = \frac{3}{2}$ dollars per sandwich

Now, we can multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package:

$\frac{3}{2} \times 8 = 12$

Therefore, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the monthly payment for the bedroom set, we need to calculate the remaining balance after Tom pays $1000 from the sale of his old bedroom set.

The initial cost of the bedroom set is $3000. After selling his old bedroom set for $1000, Tom has $1000 left to pay. Therefore, the remaining balance is:

$3000 (initial cost) - $1000 (payment from sale) = $2000

Since the interest rate is 10% per month, we can express this as a decimal by dividing by 100:

10% = 10/100 = 0.10

Now, we can calculate the monthly payment by multiplying the remaining balance by the interest rate:

$2000 (remaining balance) × 0.10 (interest rate) = $200

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

The final answer is: $200"
"To determine the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.

1. 40% of the red balloons burst:
   The number of red balloons that burst is 40% of 25, which can be calculated as $0.4 \times 25 = 10$. Therefore, the number of red balloons remaining is $25 - 10 = 15$.

2. Half of the yellow balloons were released:
   The number of yellow balloons released is $\frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6$. Consequently, the number of yellow balloons remaining is $12 - 6 = 6$.

3. 75% of the blue balloons were added:
   The number of blue balloons added is 75% of 8, which can be calculated as $0.75 \times 8 = 6$. Therefore, the total number of balloons now is $15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34$.

The number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability of having to turn in his homework.

Let's denote the probability of not having to turn in his homework as P(not turn in). We can express this as:

P(not turn in) = P(substitute teacher) + P(normal teacher extension) + P(normal teacher no extension and convinces teacher)

P(substitute teacher) = 50%
P(normal teacher extension) = 40%
P(normal teacher no extension and convinces teacher) = 20% * 60% = 12%

P(not turn in) = 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%

Since P(not turn in) cannot be greater than 100%, we can subtract 100% from both sides of the equation to get:

P(turn in) = 100% - P(not turn in)
P(turn in) = 100% - 102%

However, we cannot subtract 102% from 100% directly. We can rewrite 102% as 100% + 2%. Then, we can subtract 100% from both sides of the equation:

P(turn in) = 100% - (100% + 2%)
P(turn in) = -2%

However, a probability cannot be negative. This means that our initial assumption that the total probability of not having to turn in his homework is 102% is incorrect. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the three scenarios:

However, we are given that the probability of the normal teacher giving an extension is 40%. This means that the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension is 100% - 40% = 60%. We can then multiply this probability by the probability of Marcus convincing the teacher that his dog ate his assignment:

P(normal teacher no extension and convinces teacher) = 20% * 60% = 12%

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the three scenarios: 

P(substitute teacher) = 50%
P(normal teacher extension) = 40%
P(normal teacher no extension and convinces teacher) = 20% * 60% = 12%

However, we are given that the probability of the normal teacher giving an extension is 40%. This means that the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension is 100% - 40% = 60%.

"To determine the number of tickets each graduate can receive, we need to calculate the available seating capacity after accounting for the reserved seats for graduates and faculty.

Let's denote the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center as C, the number of reserved seats for graduates and faculty as R, and the number of tickets each graduate can receive as T. We are given that C = 6000 and R = 950.

Available seats = C - R
Available seats = 6000 - 950
Available seats = 5050

Now, we can calculate the number of tickets each graduate can receive by dividing the available seats by the number of graduates. Let's denote the number of graduates as G. We are given that G = 950.

T = Available seats / G
T = 5050 / 950
T = 5.32

Since we cannot distribute a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, the remaining tickets are for guests, implying that each graduate can give out the calculated number of tickets to their friends and family.

Therefore, the number of tickets each graduate can receive is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relative quantities of each size of jelly bean. Let's denote the number of large jelly beans as L, medium-sized jelly beans as M, and small jelly beans as S.

Given that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up, we can set L = 75.

We are also told that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, so M = 2L = 2(75) = 150.

Furthermore, we know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean, which can be expressed as S = 3M. Substituting the value of M, we get S = 3(150) = 450.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

The final answer is: $\boxed{450}$"
"To determine Melissa's hourly pay after expenses, we need to calculate her net earnings and then divide that by the total number of hours she worked.

First, let's calculate her total earnings: 3 days * $15 per day = $45. However, she also has to pay $3 for parking each day, so her total expenses are 3 days * $3 per day = $9. 

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: 
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Next, we need to find out how many hours she worked in total: 
Total hours = 6 hours per day * 3 days
Total hours = 18 hours

Now, let's calculate her hourly pay after expenses:
Hourly pay after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours
Hourly pay after expenses = $36 / 18
Hourly pay after expenses = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the total amount spent by Ted, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. Specifically, we will utilize the distributive property of multiplication to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately, then sum the results.

Let's denote the cost of one book as $16 and the cost of one pencil as $6. Since Ted purchases 3 books and 3 pencils, we can express the total cost as follows:

Total cost = (cost of 3 books) + (cost of 3 pencils)
= 3 × 16 + 3 × 6

Using the distributive property, we can rewrite the expression as:

Total cost = (3 × 16) + (3 × 6)
= 48 + 18

Now, we can add the two values to obtain the total cost:

Total cost = 48 + 18
= 66

Therefore, Ted spent a total of $66.

The final answer is: $66"
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of soda bottles and then multiply it by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

Given that the driveway is 24 feet wide and Richard wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can calculate the total number of bottles by dividing the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

$$\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}$$

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can find the total time by multiplying the number of bottles by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:

$$8 \text{ bottles} \times 5 \text{ seconds/bottle} = 40 \text{ seconds}$$

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 40 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of packs Uncle Franky can make with the two boxes of apples, we first need to calculate the total number of apples he has. Since each box contains 40 apples and he ordered two boxes, the total number of apples is given by the product of the number of boxes and the number of apples per box: 2 * 40 = 80 apples.

Next, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples, given that each pack contains 8 apples. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack: 80 / 8 = 10.

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes he ordered.

"To determine the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she purchased and subtract it from her initial cash amount.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 × $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 × $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Given that Amor starts with $50, we can calculate the remaining amount of money she has after purchasing the cheese as follows:

$50 (initial cash) - $40 (total cost of cheese) = $10

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

The final answer is: $10"
"To determine the time it takes for Jim to repay the loans and compensate for the lost income, we need to calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn. This can be found by adding the total amount of loans taken to the amount of money lost due to not working while in college.

The total amount of loans taken is $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

The amount of money lost by not working while in college is $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000.

Therefore, the total amount of money Jim needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After completing his degree, Jim's income triples, so his new annual income is $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find the number of years it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can use the formula for simple interest:

Time = Total Amount / Annual Income
Time = $300,000 / $75,000/year

Time = 4 years

"To determine the total area of fabric Jim needs, we must first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. Given that the bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of one piece of fabric is calculated as length multiplied by width, so the area of one piece is 8 \* 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim requires two pieces, the total area is 2 \* 80 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the total number of letters delivered by the post office from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and sum them together.

Let's begin by calculating the number of letters delivered on Monday. We are given that the post office delivered 425 letters on this day.

Next, we need to find the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. We are told that the post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many letters as they did on Monday. To find one-fifth of the number of letters delivered on Monday, we can divide 425 by 5:

$$\frac{425}{5} = 85$$

Now, we add 17 to this result to find the total number of letters delivered on Tuesday:

$$85 + 17 = 102$$

Moving on to Wednesday, we are informed that the post office delivered 5 more than twice as many letters as they did on Tuesday. To find twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday, we multiply 102 by 2:

$$2 \times 102 = 204$$

Finally, we add 5 to this result to find the total number of letters delivered on Wednesday:

$$204 + 5 = 209$$

Now, we can sum the number of letters delivered each day to find the total:

$$425 + 102 + 209 = 736$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{736}$"

"To determine the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races.

Let's denote the amount lost in the first race as $L1 = -$5.

In the second race, the amount won is $1 more than twice the amount lost in the first race, which can be expressed as $W2 = 2L1 + $1 = 2(-$5) + $1 = -$9.

In the third race, the amount lost is 1.5 times the amount won in the second race, which can be expressed as $L3 = 1.5W2 = 1.5(-$9) = -$13.50.

Now, let's calculate the total loss: $L_total = L1 + W2 + L3 = -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.50) = -$27.50.

The number of races is 3.

To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races: $L_avg = \frac{L_total}{3} = \frac{-\$27.50}{3} = -\$9.17.

The final answer is: $9.17"
"To determine the total population of South America, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. Given that there are 26 countries in South America, each with 5 cities, and a population of 1000 individuals residing in each city, we can calculate the total population by multiplying the number of countries by the number of cities per country and then by the population per city.

Let's denote the number of countries as C, the number of cities per country as N, and the population per city as P. Therefore, the total population (TP) can be calculated as follows:

TP = C × N × P

Substituting the given values, we have:

C = 26
N = 5
P = 1000

TP = 26 × 5 × 1000
TP = 130,000

The total population of South America is 130,000."
"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their current heights. 

First, let's convert Xavier's height from feet to inches, as it will be easier to work with a single unit of measurement. Since 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches. Adding the 3 inches he grew over the summer, his current height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

Next, we calculate Cole's current height by adding the 2 inches he grew over the summer to his initial height of 50 inches. Therefore, Cole's current height is 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier by subtracting Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

Therefore, the share of the first person is $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To determine the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, we calculate the total number of days worked. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Next, we need to convert 3/8ths of a day to hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can express 3/8 as a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 3 ÷ 8 = 0.375. Then, we multiply this decimal by the number of hours in a day: 0.375 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to find the hours worked by each painter: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{47.25}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides:

2.5x = 15

Divide both sides by 2.5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the price of the car in 2010, we can utilize the concept of exponential decay, which is a common model for depreciation. The formula for exponential decay is given by:

P(t) = P0 * (1 - r)^t

where P(t) is the price at time t, P0 is the initial price, r is the depreciation rate, and t is the time period.

Given that the initial price of the car is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% per year, and we want to find the price in 2010, we can calculate the price as follows:

P0 = $20,000
r = 0.21 (21% as a decimal)
t = 3 years (from 2007 to 2010)

P(3) = $20,000 * (1 - 0.21)^3
= $20,000 * (0.79)^3
= $20,000 * 0.4914

"To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we can utilize a simple subtraction method after identifying the number of books written in English and German.

First, we calculate the number of English books, which is half of the total number of books: $\frac{50}{2} = 25$.

Next, we calculate the number of German books, which is 10% of the total number of books: $50 \times 0.1 = 5$.

Now, we can find the total number of books written in English and German by adding these two quantities: $25 + 5 = 30$.

Finally, we subtract the total number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: $50 - 30 = 20$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the remaining distance Bernice needs to drive, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. Given that the total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is approximately 1955 kilometers, and Bernice has driven 325 kilometers over a period of 4 days, we can calculate the remaining distance as follows:

Let's denote the total distance as d = 1955 km and the distance driven as d_d = 325 km. The remaining distance, denoted as d_r, can be calculated using the formula:

d_r = d - d_d

Substituting the given values, we get:

d_r = 1955 - 325
d_r = 1630 km

Therefore, Bernice will still need to drive 1630 kilometers to reach her destination.

The final answer is: 1630"
"To determine the amount of water Ingrid drinks in gallons over a 30-day period, we can employ a straightforward approach by first calculating the total number of cups consumed and then converting that value to gallons.

Ingrid's daily water intake is 8 cups. To find the total cups consumed over 30 days, we can multiply her daily intake by the number of days:

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to convert the total cups to gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can perform the conversion by dividing the total cups by the number of cups per gallon:

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water over a 30-day period.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we can use a step-by-step approach to track the changes in the number of passengers.

Initially, there are 120 people on the train. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, increasing the total to 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people disembark, and 100 people board the train. This can be represented as a change in the total number of people: 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

Finally, at the third stop, 80 people disembark, resulting in a total of 190 - 80 = 110 people on the train.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To determine the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and sum them up.

First, let's consider the cost of the tank top, which is $10. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so their cost can be expressed as $10 + $5 = $15.

The tennis shoes were originally priced at $48 but were on sale for half price. To find the sale price, we divide the original price by 2: $48 ÷ 2 = $24.

The athletic socks cost $8, and Alison had a coupon for $2 off. The discounted price of the socks can be calculated as $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

The final answer is: $55"
"To determine the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and multiply it by the cost of each tile.

Increased cost = Normal cost + (Normal cost * Increase percentage)
= $120 + ($120 * 0.6)
= $120 + $72
= $192

Since the increased cost is $192 per month, we can calculate the annual cost by multiplying this value by 12:

Annual cost = Increased cost * 12
= $192 * 12
= $2304

Therefore, James pays $2304 per year for his insurance.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
- 4 twin beds = 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets
- 1 king size bed = 1 king sheet
- Total sheets = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week.
- 3 sets * 1 load/set = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we can calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and then multiply it by 4.

Let's denote the number of movies they watch on Saturday as S. Given that they watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday, the number of movies they watch on Sunday can be expressed as S/2.

The total number of movies they watch in one weekend is the sum of the movies watched on Saturday and Sunday, which is S + S/2.

To simplify the expression, we can find a common denominator, which is 2. This gives us (2S + S)/2 = 3S/2.

Since they watch 4 movies on Saturday, we can substitute S = 4 into the expression to find the total number of movies they watch in one weekend: 3S/2 = 3(4)/2 = 12/2 = 6.

In 4 weeks, they watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

Therefore, the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the total number of stickers in Leo's collection, we can utilize a simple arithmetic progression. Let's break down the information provided:

1. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
2. Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
3. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, we can calculate the total number of stickers by summing the stickers from all three years: 100 + 150 + 250 = 500 stickers.

Therefore, the total number of stickers in Leo's collection is 500.

The final answer is: $\boxed{500}$"
"To determine the duration for which 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the daily consumption of cat food and then divide the total amount of cat food by this value.

Each cat consumes 60 grams of cat food per meal, and since they are fed twice a day, the daily consumption per cat is 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams.

For 3 cats, the total daily consumption is 3 * 120 grams = 360 grams.

Now, we can calculate the number of days the cat food will last by dividing the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily consumption (360 grams): 

$$\frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a systematic approach by first determining the total number of slices available and then allocating them based on the given information.

Given that each pizza has 8 slices and there are 4 pizzas, the total number of slices is 8 * 4 = 32.

Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as x. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Becky ate x + 3 slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2x slices.

We know that Becky ate 10 slices. Therefore, we can set up the equation x + 3 = 10 to find the number of slices Jake ate. Solving for x, we get x = 7.

Now that we know Jake ate 7 slices, we can find the number of slices Silvia ate by multiplying 2 and 7, which equals 14.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we add the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can express Betsy's time as x + 18.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x represents the time Donovan's part took, and Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to consider the expenses associated with the cast, the medical consultation, painkillers, and parking.

First, let's calculate the cost of the cast, which is a fixed expense of $200.

Next, we need to determine the cost of the medical consultation. The doctor charges $300 per hour, and the visit lasted for 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the visit duration is 0.5 hours. Therefore, the cost of the consultation is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is calculated by multiplying the number of pills by the cost per pill. In this case, Hannah received 30 painkillers at $4 per pill, resulting in a total cost of $120.

Lastly, we need to calculate the cost of parking, which is a fixed minimum of 2 hours at $6 per hour. Therefore, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we add the costs of the cast, consultation, painkillers, and parking:

Total cost = $200 (cast) + $150 (consultation) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking)
Total cost = $482

The final answer is: $482"
"To determine the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we first need to calculate the number of emails he doesn't respond to. This can be found by calculating 20% of the total daily emails.

20% of 80 emails is given by the expression 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

To find the total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the daily number of emails he responds to by the number of workdays in the week: 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To determine the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we can calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then sum these values.

Let's begin by identifying the number of classes that visited each day. On Monday, 32 classes visited. On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited, which is equivalent to 2 * 32 = 64 classes. On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, which is equivalent to 3 * 32 = 96 classes. On Thursday, 30 classes visited, and on Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, we can calculate the total number of classes that visited the Science Center by summing the number of classes that visited each day:

Total classes = 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25

To perform this calculation, we can use the commutative property of addition, which states that the order in which we add numbers does not affect the result. Therefore, we can rearrange the numbers to make the calculation easier:

Total classes = (32 + 30) + (64 + 25) + 96
Total classes = 62 + 89 + 96
Total classes = 247

The final answer is: 247"
"To calculate the average score, we need to compute the arithmetic mean of the test scores. The formula for the arithmetic mean is given by:

$$\text{Average} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}$$

where $x_i$ represents the individual scores and $n$ is the number of tests.

Given that John scored 100 on his first three tests and 80 on his fourth test, we can calculate the sum of the scores as follows:

$$\sum x_i = 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380$$

Now, we divide the sum by the number of tests to obtain the average score:

$$\text{Average} = \frac{380}{4} = 95$$

Therefore, John's average score across the four tests is 95."
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. This can be expressed as 0.7 \* 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 \* 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 \* 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total cost of postage for Anthony's pizza parlor, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small and big coupons separately and then sum them up.

Let's denote the number of small coupons as S and the number of big coupons as B. We are given that S = 700 and B = 2S = 2 * 700 = 1400.

The cost per small coupon is $0.05, and the cost per big coupon is $0.15. Therefore, the total cost of mailing small coupons is 0.05S = 0.05 * 700 = $35, and the total cost of mailing big coupons is 0.15B = 0.15 * 1400 = $210.

The total cost of postage is the sum of the cost of mailing small and big coupons: Total Cost = 0.05S + 0.15B = 35 + 210 = $245.

The final answer is: $245"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. Initially, Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This can be expressed as:

10 - 3 = 7

So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the initial order is:

7 \* 4 = 28

Mark then ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches. Sidney subsequently ordered 3 more sub sandwiches, bringing the total to 3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches.

Now, we need to find the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 sub sandwiches. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, we can calculate this as:

6 \* 4 = 24

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"Given that Mr. Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks carrying 20 tons of fertiliser each, we can calculate the total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers after a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures.

Let's denote the total number of trucks dispatched as T = 20. The number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures is a quarter of T, which can be expressed as (1/4)T. Therefore, the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures is (1/4) * 20 = 5.

The number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is the difference between the total number of trucks dispatched and the number that experienced mechanical failures: T - (1/4)T = (3/4)T. Substituting T = 20, we get (3/4) * 20 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, the total tons of fertiliser delivered is the product of the number of trucks that delivered and the tons per truck: 15 * 20 = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 300 tons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine the cost of purchasing 6 pounds of butter under the given promotion, we can break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's understand the promotion: for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis pays the full price of $4.00 for one pound and half off for the other pound. This can be represented as a weighted average of the full price and the discounted price.

The cost of 2 pounds of butter under the promotion is:
\[ C_{2\text{ pounds}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 4.00 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2.00 = 3.00 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 6 pounds of butter. Since Dennis needs to buy 3 sets of 2 pounds, we can multiply the cost of 2 pounds by 3:

\[ C_{6\text{ pounds}} = 3 \cdot C_{2\text{ pounds}} = 3 \cdot 3.00 = 9.00 \]

However, this is the cost for the full price of 3 pounds and the discounted price of 3 pounds. To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the full price of 1 pound (since the promotion is buy one pound get one half off, and we have 6 pounds in total):

\[ C_{\text{total}} = C_{6\text{ pounds}} + 1 \cdot 4.00 = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To determine the total cost of Kayla's party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests and multiply it by the cost per guest, then add the initial fee.

First, let's calculate the total number of guests attending the party. Kayla invited her 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, as well as 13 family members. However, 4 people said they could not come. Therefore, the total number of guests attending is:

Total invited guests = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45
Guests who could not come = 4
Total guests attending = 45 - 4 = 41

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests:

Additional guests = Total guests attending - 20 = 41 - 20 = 21

Now, we can calculate the cost for the additional guests:

Cost per additional guest = $6
Cost for additional guests = 21 * 6 = $126

Finally, we add the initial fee to the cost for the additional guests to find the total cost:

Total cost = Initial fee + Cost for additional guests
= $125 + $126
= $251

The final answer is: $251"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the initial amount of money Maggie and Riza had. Let's denote this amount as x. Since they both had $60, we can set up the following equations:

Maggie's money after spending a quarter: (3/4)x = 60
Riza's money after spending one-third: (2/3)x = 60

We can solve for x by multiplying both sides of each equation by the reciprocal of the fraction:

Maggie's equation: (4/3) * (3/4)x = 60 * (4/3)
Riza's equation: (3/2) * (2/3)x = 60 * (3/2)

Simplifying the equations, we get:

Maggie's equation: x = 80
Riza's equation: x = 60

However, since both equations should yield the same value for x, we can use either equation to find the initial amount of money. Let's use Maggie's equation: x = 80.

Now that we know the initial amount of money, we can find the amount of money Maggie and Riza have left. Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is (1/4) * 80 = 20. So, she has 80 - 20 = 60 dollars left. Riza spent one-third of her money, which is (1/3) * 80 = 26.67. So, she has 80 - 26.67 = 53.33 dollars left.

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add the money Maggie and Riza have: 60 + 53.33 = 113.33.

The final answer is: $113.33"
"To determine the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can start by calculating the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys. The first monkey eats 10 bananas daily, and the second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first, which is 14 bananas per day.

Let's denote the number of bananas the third monkey eats as x. The total number of bananas consumed by the three monkeys in a day is the sum of the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys and the bananas eaten by the third monkey, which is 10 + 14 + x = 24 + x.

Since the total number of bananas is 315 and they last for a week (7 days), we can calculate the total number of bananas eaten in a week as 315. To find the total number of bananas eaten each day, we divide 315 by 7:

$$\frac{315}{7} = 45$$

Now, we know that the first two monkeys eat a total of 24 bananas each day. Therefore, the third monkey eats the remaining bananas, which is 45 - 24 = 21 bananas per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he placed. 

Let's break it down: Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, which is equivalent to 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he completed another 500-piece puzzle. 

The total number of pieces he placed is the sum of the pieces from the first and second puzzles: 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine the number of quarters Jenny leaves with after purchasing the roses, we need to calculate the total cost of the flowers and the change she receives.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses. Since 15 roses is not a multiple of 12, we can buy 1 dozen (12 roses) for $15 and 3 individual roses for $6. The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrives with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. To find the change, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Terry makes, we can calculate the revenue generated from each item and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the revenue from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each is given by the product 6 × $5.50 = $33.

Next, we calculate the revenue from burger platters: 9 platters at $11 each is given by the product 9 × $11 = $99.

Lastly, we calculate the revenue from sodas: 20 sodas at $1.50 each is given by the product 20 × $1.50 = $30.

Now, we can find the total revenue by summing the revenues from each item: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To determine the total time Paul will wait for his train, we can break down the problem into manageable intervals. Let's analyze the given information:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. Therefore, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, let's calculate the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. We can do this by summing the time intervals between the trains:

- Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train.
- He waits from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train.
- He waits from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train.
- He waits from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is the sum of these intervals: 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week, we can use a simple linear equation. Let's denote the number of weeks as 'w'. The total number of toothpicks saved is the product of the rate and the number of weeks, which should be equal to the target number of toothpicks (200).

The equation can be set up as follows:
10w = 200

To solve for 'w', we divide both sides of the equation by 10:
w = 200 / 10
w = 20

However, this is the total number of weeks Melanie has already saved toothpicks. We need to find the additional weeks required to reach 200 toothpicks. Since Melanie has already saved toothpicks for 12 weeks, we subtract this from the total number of weeks:
w = 20 - 12
w = 8

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. Given that he purchased it at 75% of the original price, we can express this as a mathematical operation:

P_bought = P_original \* 0.75

where P_bought is the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and P_original is the original price of the watch, which is $2000.

P_bought = 2000 \* 0.75
P_bought = $1500

Next, we need to find the price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend. He sold it at 120% of the price he bought it, which can be expressed as:

P_sold = P_bought \* 1.2

P_sold = 1500 \* 1.2
P_sold = $1800

Now, we can calculate the discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price by subtracting the price he paid from the original price:

Discount = P_original - P_sold
Discount = 2000 - 1800
Discount = $200

To find the percentage discount, we can use the formula:

Percentage Discount = (Discount / P_original) \* 100
Percentage Discount = (200 / 2000) \* 100
Percentage Discount = 10%

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs and the rate at which they create jellyfish per second.

First, we calculate the total number of seconds in 4 hours:

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5. Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds is:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"To determine Frankie's bowling score, we can establish a relationship between his score and Binkie's score. Let's denote Binkie's score as B and Frankie's score as F. We are given that Frankie's score is 15 better than twice as high as Binkie's. This relationship can be expressed as:

F = 2B + 15

We are also given that Binkie's score is 90. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

F = 2(90) + 15

To find Frankie's score, we need to evaluate this expression. First, we multiply 2 by 90:

2(90) = 180

Now, we add 15 to this result:

F = 180 + 15
F = 195

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To determine the time it took James to reach the store, we must first calculate the total distance he traveled. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back, the total distance is twice the distance to the store, which is 2 * 4 miles = 8 miles.

Given that James walks at a constant speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula for time, which is time = distance / speed. Substituting the values, we get time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

Therefore, the time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jenny saved by purchasing bananas in bunches instead of individually, we can calculate the cost of each scenario and compare the results.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas purchased: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost would be: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by purchasing the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet. 

The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 40.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the rate at which the crocodile grows, we can use the concept of linear growth. The formula for linear growth is given by:

y = mx + b

where y is the total growth, m is the growth rate, x is the number of years, and b is the initial value (which is 0 in this case, as we are only considering the growth).

Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can use this information to find the growth rate (m). We can rearrange the formula to solve for m:

m = y / x
m = 8 inches / 4 years
m = 2 inches/year

Now that we have the growth rate, we can use it to find the total growth in 13 years:

y = mx
y = (2 inches/year) * 13 years
y = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

The final answer is: 26"
"To determine Marcel's total earnings from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

Let's start by finding the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field, we need to consider the production rate of the farmer and the collection rate of the truck. The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, while the truck collects 3 bales per hour. Given that both the farmer and the truck operate for 6 hours, we can calculate the total production and collection rates.

The total number of bales produced by the farmer is given by the product of the production rate and the number of hours worked: $5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales}$.

Similarly, the total number of bales collected by the truck is given by the product of the collection rate and the number of hours worked: $3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales}$.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales collected from the total number of bales produced: $30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales}$.

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the total minutes spent in class and the additional minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the total minutes spent in class. John has 6 regular periods and 2 extra classes, each lasting 40 minutes. The total minutes spent in class per day is given by:

$$
\text{minutes per day} = (6 + 2) \times 40 = 8 \times 40 = 320 \text{ minutes}
$$

Since John attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes spent in class per week is:

$$
\text{minutes per week} = 320 \times 5 = 1600 \text{ minutes}
$$

Next, we need to calculate the additional minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. The total minutes in a week is:

$$
\text{minutes per week} = 7 \times 24 \times 60 = 1680 \text{ minutes}
$$

Therefore, the additional minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday is:

$$
\text{additional minutes} = \frac{1}{16} \times 1680 = 105 \text{ minutes}
$$

Since John spends this additional time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total additional minutes per week is:

$$
\text{total additional minutes} = 105 \times 2 = 210 \text{ minutes}
$$

Now, we can find the total minutes spent learning per week by adding the minutes spent in class and the additional minutes:

$$
\text{total minutes} = 1600 + 210 = 1810 \text{ minutes}
$$

Finally, we convert the total minutes to hours:

$$
\text{total hours} = \frac{1810}{60} = 30.17 \text{ hours}
$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{30.17}$"
"To determine the height of the bouncy ball on its second bounce, we can apply the concept of exponential decay, which is a common phenomenon in physics and mathematics. The height of the ball after each bounce can be modeled using the formula:

h_n = h_0 \* (2/3)^n

where h_n is the height of the ball after the nth bounce, h_0 is the initial height, and n is the bounce number.

Given that the initial height of the ball is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet, we can calculate the height of the ball after the second bounce by substituting n = 2 into the formula:

h_2 = 72 \* (2/3)^2
h_2 = 72 \* (4/9)
h_2 = 32 feet

Therefore, the height of the ball on its second bounce is 32 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we can approach this problem by calculating the height of each child step by step.

First, we convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height of the first child in inches is $6 \times 12 = 72$ inches.

Next, we calculate the height of the second child, which is two inches taller than the first child. Therefore, the height of the second child is $72 + 2 = 74$ inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the height of the third child is $74 - 5 = 69$ inches.

Finally, the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the height of the fourth child is $69 + 3 = 72$ inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the total earnings of the apple orchard, we need to calculate the number of bags sold and then multiply it by the price per bag. Given that each bag contains 10 apples and the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples, we can calculate the number of bags as follows:

Number of bags = Total apples / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200

Now, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

Total earnings = Number of bags * Price per bag
= 200 * $5
= $1000

Therefore, the apple orchard earned $1000 from selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"To determine the original weight of the triceratops, we can apply a series of inverse operations to the information provided. Let's denote the original weight of the triceratops as $W$. 

Initially, the Allosaurus consumed the last 270 kilograms of meat, which was half of what the velociraptors had. Therefore, the velociraptors had $2 \times 270 = 540$ kilograms of meat.

Since the velociraptors scavenged half of what remained after the T-Rex, the T-Rex must have consumed half of the original weight of the triceratops. Consequently, the T-Rex ate $540$ kilograms, which is half of $W$. This implies that $W = 540 \times 2 = 1080$ kilograms.

Therefore, the original weight of the triceratops was 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2160}$"
"To determine the cost of painting the room, we must first calculate the total surface area of the walls that require painting. The north and south walls, each measuring 10 feet in width and 8 feet in height, have an area of 2 * (10 * 8) = 160 square feet. The east and west walls, each measuring 5 feet in width and 8 feet in height, have an area of 2 * (5 * 8) = 80 square feet. Therefore, the total area of the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Given that a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we can calculate the number of gallons required by dividing the total area by the coverage of a single gallon: 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost of painting the room is 12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of her selecting a shaken can from the remaining options.

Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas, of which 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. After taking 1 unshaken soda for herself, there were 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas left. Ellen's brother then took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, resulting in 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Given that there are now 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken, the probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can can be calculated as follows:

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) × 100
Probability = 14.29%

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 14.29%."
"To determine the distance between the two trains, we can utilize the concept of relative motion. Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we can calculate the total distance between them by adding the distances each train has traveled.

Let's denote the speed of the first train as $v_1 = 60$ miles per hour and the speed of the second train as $v_2 = \frac{1}{2}v_1 = 30$ miles per hour. The time elapsed is $t = 3$ hours.

The distance traveled by the first train is given by $d_1 = v_1t = 60 \cdot 3 = 180$ miles.

The distance traveled by the second train is given by $d_2 = v_2t = 30 \cdot 3 = 90$ miles.

The total distance between the two trains is the sum of the distances they have traveled, which is $d_{total} = d_1 + d_2 = 180 + 90 = 270$ miles.

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the total number of people Billy helps, we first need to calculate the number of days he is available to volunteer. The period in question spans from March 1st to April 19th, which includes 31 days in March and 19 days in April, totaling 50 days.

However, Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find the number of days he is unavailable, we calculate 20% of 50:

$$
\text{Days off} = 0.20 \times 50 = 10
$$

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy is available to volunteer:

$$
\text{Available days} = 50 - 10 = 40
$$

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he can help per day is:

$$
\text{People per day} = 2 \times 3 = 6
$$

To find the total number of people Billy helps, we multiply the number of available days by the number of people he can help per day:

$$
\text{Total people helped} = 40 \times 6 = 240
$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of individuals transported by the buses and the private cars. 

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the private cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the private cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we can infer that the number of people inside the church is equal to the number of people transported, assuming that all individuals present were transported by the buses or private cars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To determine Jeff's age, we can establish a series of relationships between the individuals involved. Let's denote Mike's age as M, Martha's age as m, and Jeff's age as j. We are given that Mike is 24 years old, so M = 24.

We also know that Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, which can be expressed as m = M - 4. Substituting the value of M, we get m = 24 - 4 = 20.

Furthermore, we are told that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, which can be written as j = m + 10. Substituting the value of m, we get j = 20 + 10 = 30.

Therefore, Jeff's age is 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the time difference between riding the biggest and the second biggest waterslides at Five Flags, we can apply the concept of time and speed. The time it takes to ride a slide is inversely proportional to its speed. 

For the biggest slide, with a length of 300 feet and a speed of 60 feet per minute, the time taken to ride it can be calculated as follows:

t1 = length / speed = 300 / 60 = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide, with a length of 240 feet and a speed of 80 feet per minute, the time taken to ride it can be calculated as follows:

t2 = length / speed = 240 / 80 = 3 minutes

Now, to find the time difference between the two slides, we subtract the time taken for the second biggest slide from the time taken for the biggest slide:

time difference = t1 - t2 = 5 - 3 = 2 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks after 5 days, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. The total time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes. The total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: $\frac{60}{60} = 1$ hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. After 5 days, the total time spent is $1 \times 5 = 5$ hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of miles Ahito ran, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of miles Amber ran as A, Micah as M, and Ahito as H. We are given that A = 8 miles and M = 3.5A.

Given that the total miles run by all three is 52, we can express this as an equation:

A + M + H = 52

Substituting the given values, we get:

8 + 3.5A + H = 52

Since M = 3.5A, we can rewrite the equation as:

8 + 3.5(8) + H = 52

First, we calculate 3.5(8):

3.5(8) = 28

Now, we substitute this value back into the equation:

8 + 28 + H = 52

Combine the constants:

36 + H = 52

To isolate H, we subtract 36 from both sides of the equation:

H = 52 - 36
H = 16

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item and then add that to the initial charge.

First, let's calculate the initial balance after the return:

Initial charge: $85.00
Return: -$15.00
New balance = Initial charge - Return
New balance = $85.00 - $15.00
New balance = $70.00

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the frying pan and the towels after applying the discounts.

Frying pan: The original price of the frying pan is $20.00, and it is on sale for 20% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (20% = 0.20):
Discount = 0.20 * $20.00
Discount = $4.00
Price of frying pan = Original price - Discount
Price of frying pan = $20.00 - $4.00
Price of frying pan = $16.00

Towels: The original price of the towels is $30.00, and they are on sale for 10% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (10% = 0.10):
Discount = 0.10 * $30.00
Discount = $3.00
Price of towels = Original price - Discount
Price of towels = $30.00 - $3.00
Price of towels = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the new purchases:
Total cost of new purchases = Price of frying pan + Price of towels
Total cost of new purchases = $16.00 + $27.00
Total cost of new purchases = $43.00

Finally, we add the total cost of the new purchases to the new balance:
New balance = New balance + Total cost of new purchases
New balance = $70.00 + $43.00
New balance = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To determine the total number of jellyfish in the tank, we can utilize the information provided about the jellyfish that change color under UV light. Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'.

We know that a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Since the remaining two-thirds of the large jellyfish do not change color, they are small and always stay blue. However, we are not directly interested in the number of small jellyfish, but rather the total number of jellyfish.

Given that 6 jellyfish changed color, and this represents a third of the large jellyfish, we can set up the following equation:

$\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{x}{5} = 6$

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15 (the least common multiple of 3 and 5):

$\frac{x}{5} = 6 \cdot 3$
$\frac{x}{5} = 18$
$x = 18 \cdot 5$
$x = 90$

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a linear relationship between the ages of Caroline, Ben, and Chris. Let's denote Chris's age as C, Ben's age as B, and Caroline's age as A. We are given that Chris is 4 years old, so C = 4.

We are also given that Ben is two times older than Chris, which can be expressed as B = 2C. Substituting the value of C, we get B = 2(4) = 8.

Lastly, we are told that Caroline is three times older than Ben, which can be expressed as A = 3B. Substituting the value of B, we get A = 3(8) = 24.

Therefore, Caroline's age is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of years Lauren needs to work to save for retirement, we must first calculate the total amount she needs to save. Given that she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary of $100,000 in retirement, her annual retirement income will be:

$$
\text{Annual retirement income} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
$$

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:

$$
\text{Total savings needed} = \text{Annual retirement income} \times \text{Number of years in retirement} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
$$

Now, we can calculate the number of years it will take her to save this amount at a rate of $20,000 per year:

$$
\text{Number of years} = \frac{\text{Total savings needed}}{\text{Annual savings}} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40
$$

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save for her retirement.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the length of each final cut, we can approach this problem by first dividing the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into, and then dividing that result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Let's denote the total length of the ribbon as L = 100 cm, the number of parts it will be cut into as n = 4, and the number of parts each of those will be cut into as m = 5.

The length of each part after the first cut is given by L/n = 100/4 = 25 cm.

To find the length of each final cut, we divide this result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into: 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm.

Therefore, the length of each final cut is 5 cm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of girls in the school, we can utilize the concept of proportions. Given that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys, we can establish a proportion to find the total number of students in the school.

Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. We can set up the following proportion:

40% of x = 240

To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for 'x' by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

This indicates that the total number of students in the school is 600.

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we can multiply the total number of students by the decimal equivalent of 60%:

Number of girls = 0.6 * 600
Number of girls = 360

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"To determine the total expenditure at the gardening shop, we can apply a straightforward arithmetic operation. The initial step involves calculating the total cost of the items purchased, which includes a set of pots and a sack of garden soil. The cost of the pots is $19, and the cost of the garden soil is $26. 

Total cost = Cost of pots + Cost of garden soil
Total cost = $19 + $26
Total cost = $45

However, a coupon discount of $7 is applied at the checkout. To find the final expenditure, we subtract the discount from the total cost.

Final expenditure = Total cost - Discount
Final expenditure = $45 - $7
Final expenditure = $38

Therefore, the total amount spent at the gardening shop is $38."
"To calculate the average height of heels at the cocktail party, we need to determine the total height of all the heels and divide it by the total number of women.

Let's denote the number of women wearing 4-inch heels as $n_1 = 3$ and the number of women wearing 2-inch heels as $n_2 = 3$. The total number of women is $n = n_1 + n_2 = 6$.

The total height of the 4-inch heels is $h_1 = n_1 \times 4 = 3 \times 4 = 12$ inches.
The total height of the 2-inch heels is $h_2 = n_2 \times 2 = 3 \times 2 = 6$ inches.

The total height of all the heels is $h = h_1 + h_2 = 12 + 6 = 18$ inches.

The average height of heels is the total height divided by the total number of women: $\frac{h}{n} = \frac{18}{6} = 3$ inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the additional miles Soledad must hike per day to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of days available for hiking in June. Since June has 30 days, we can use this as our time constraint.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which translates to a daily mileage of 125 * 2 = 250 miles.

To find the total number of days required to complete 9,300 miles at this rate, we divide the total miles by the daily mileage: 9,300 miles / 250 miles/day = 37.2 days.

However, Soledad only has 30 days available, which is less than the required 37.2 days. To find the additional miles she must hike per day, we first calculate the total miles she can hike in 30 days at the rate of 250 miles/day: 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles.

The difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the miles she can hike in 30 days is 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles.

To find the additional miles per day she must hike, we divide the difference by the number of days: 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day.

Therefore, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the total revenue the store will receive from selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of ball and sum them together. This can be achieved by multiplying the quantity of each type of ball by its respective price and then adding the results.

Let's denote the number of red balls as R = 3, the number of blue balls as B = 11, and the number of green balls as G = 25. The prices of the red, blue, and green balls are $9, $5, and $3, respectively.

The revenue from selling the red balls is given by the product of the number of red balls and the price of each red ball: R × $9 = 3 × $9 = $27.

Similarly, the revenue from selling the blue balls is given by the product of the number of blue balls and the price of each blue ball: B × $5 = 11 × $5 = $55.

Lastly, the revenue from selling the green balls is given by the product of the number of green balls and the price of each green ball: G × $3 = 25 × $3 = $75.

To find the total revenue, we add the revenues from selling each type of ball: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

"To determine the amount of apples James will have left, we need to calculate the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul. 

Pierre wants a quarter of the 12 kg of apples, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3$ kg. 

Paul wants one-third of the 12 kg of apples, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4$ kg.

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is the sum of their individual portions, which is $3 + 4 = 7$ kg.

To find the amount left for James, we subtract the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul from the initial amount: $12 - 7 = 5$ kg.

Therefore, James will have 5 kg of apples left.

"To determine the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we can calculate the rate at which the light blinks per minute. Given that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can use the formula:

Rate = Total number of blinks / Total time in minutes

Plugging in the values, we get:

Rate = 255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute

Now, to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we can use the formula:

Time = Total number of blinks / Rate per minute

Substituting the values, we get:

Time = 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute

Time = 9 minutes

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

"To determine the difference between the number of female and male fishes in Tate's garden pond, we need to calculate the total number of each sex.

Initially, there are 4 male guppies and 7 female guppies, and 3 male goldfishes and 5 female goldfishes. Tate then acquires 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes.

The total number of male guppies is the sum of the initial and additional male guppies: $4 + 2 = 6$. The total number of female guppies is the sum of the initial and additional female guppies: $7 + 1 = 8$.

Similarly, the total number of male goldfishes is the sum of the initial and additional male goldfishes: $3 + 2 = 5$. The total number of female goldfishes is the sum of the initial and additional female goldfishes: $5 + 3 = 8$.

Now, we can calculate the total number of male and female fishes. The total number of male fishes is the sum of the total number of male guppies and male goldfishes: $6 + 5 = 11$. The total number of female fishes is the sum of the total number of female guppies and female goldfishes: $8 + 8 = 16$.

To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes: $16 - 11 = 5$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to complete their chores, we need to calculate the time taken by each individual and sum them together.

Let's denote the time Amalia took to mow the lawn as A, which is given as 4 hours. Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so her time can be expressed as A + 2. Dior's time is 4 hours longer than Amalia's, which can be represented as A + 4.

Given the time taken by each person, we can calculate the total time as the sum of their individual times: A + (A + 2) + (A + 4).

Simplifying the expression, we get: A + A + 2 + A + 4 = 3A + 6.

Substituting the value of A as 4, we get: 3(4) + 6 = 12 + 6 = 18.

Therefore, the total time they all took to do their chores is 18 hours.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the total distance John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to consider the round-trip distance and the frequency of his visits.

First, let's calculate the one-way distance using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time.

Given that John drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to reach his parents, the one-way distance is:

Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since the trip is round-trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2 to obtain the total round-trip distance:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

Now, considering that John visits his parents twice a month, we need to calculate the total distance driven in a month. To do this, we multiply the total round-trip distance by the number of visits:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

Therefore, John drives a total of 560 miles per month when visiting his parents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{560}$"
"To determine the distance Brian will walk in 7 days, we first need to calculate the total distance Sofie will cover in the same time frame. Given that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, her total distance can be calculated as the product of her daily distance and the number of days, which is 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles.

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can infer that Brian's distance is half of Sofie's total distance. Therefore, Brian's distance can be calculated as 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the production rate of the fifth worker, we can start by calculating the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in a 10-hour shift.

The two workers producing 6 toys per hour will produce a total of 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The other two workers producing 4 toys per hour will produce a total of 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 
Therefore, the total production rate of the first four workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Over a 10-hour shift, the first four workers will produce a total of 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 additional toys to fulfill the order, the total number of toys required is 400 + 20 = 420 toys. 
The fifth worker must have produced the remaining 420 - 200 = 220 toys.

Given that the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, we can calculate their production rate as follows:

Let x be the production rate of the fifth worker in toys per hour. 
The total number of toys produced by the fifth worker in 10 hours is 10x. 
Since the fifth worker produced 220 toys in 10 hours, we can set up the equation 10x = 220.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 220 / 10
x = 22

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 22 toys per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog and then sum them.

Given that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, we can calculate the weight of Elijah's dogs as follows:

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. Therefore, Elijah's first dog weighs $\frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15$ pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. Thus, Elijah's second dog weighs $\frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30$ pounds.

The total weight of Elijah's dogs is $15 + 30 = 45$ pounds.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

The total weight of all the dogs is $45 + 60 = 105$ pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{105}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach to backtrack the number of stickers Seth had initially.

Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had as S. Since Luis received half of Seth's stickers, Luis had S/2 stickers. 

Luis then gave half of his stickers to Kris, so Kris received (S/2)/2 = S/4 stickers. We know that Kris had 7 stickers left after giving some to Rob, which means Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, Kris had 7 + 7 = 14 stickers before giving some to Rob.

Since Kris had 14 stickers, which is S/4, we can set up the equation S/4 = 14. To solve for S, we multiply both sides by 4, resulting in S = 14 * 4 = 56.

Therefore, Seth had 56 stickers initially.

The final answer is: 56"
"To determine the total number of small bags John can make, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's he has and then divide that by the number of M&M's per small bag.

First, we calculate the total number of M&M's by multiplying the number of large bags by the weight of each bag and then by the number of M&M's per ounce. This can be expressed as:

Total M&M's = Number of large bags * Weight of each bag * M&M's per ounce
Total M&M's = 3 * 10 * 30
Total M&M's = 900

Since each small bag contains 10 M&M's, we can find the number of small bags by dividing the total number of M&M's by 10:

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / M&M's per small bag
Number of small bags = 900 / 10
Number of small bags = 90

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M's.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of days it will take Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to calculate the total distance and then divide it by the daily flight distance.

The circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. To find half of this distance, we can use the formula:

Circumference of the earth / 2 = 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

This is the total distance Alfie needs to cover. Given that he flies 400 kilometers every day, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values, we get:

Time = 20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we can establish a relationship between the speeds of the three cars: the average car, the second-fastest car, and the fastest car.

Let's denote the speed of the average car as $v_{avg} = 120$ miles per hour. According to the problem, the second-fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so its speed is $v_{2nd} = 5v_{avg} = 5 \times 120 = 600$ miles per hour.

Now, we are given that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second-fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is $v_{fast} = 1.25v_{2nd} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750$ miles per hour.

Thus, the speed of the fastest car is 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine Vince's current age, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Vince's current age as V. Two years ago, Liam's age was twice that of Vince's, so we can set up the following equation:

Liam's age two years ago = 2 * Vince's age two years ago

We know that Liam is currently 16 years old, so two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:

14 = 2 * (V - 2)

To solve for V, we can start by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

14/2 = (V - 2)

7 = V - 2

Next, we can add 2 to both sides of the equation to isolate V:

7 + 2 = V

V = 9

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we can write the equation A = M.

We are also given that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so we can write the equation C + S = 30.

Additionally, we know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, which can be represented as C = S + 12.

We can use the first two equations to express A and M in terms of S. Since A = M, we can substitute M with A in the equation C + S = 30, giving us C + A = 30.

Now, we can substitute C = S + 12 into the equation C + A = 30, which gives us S + 12 + A = 30.

Since A = M, we can rewrite the equation as S + 12 + M = 30.

We can also express the total number of eggs painted as the sum of the eggs painted by each person: A + M + C + S = 56.

Substituting the values of A and C in terms of S, we get A + M + (S + 12) + S = 56.

Since A = M, we can rewrite the equation as 2A + 2S + 12 = 56.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives 2A + 2S = 44.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives A + S = 22.

Now, we can substitute the value of S + 12 = C into the equation A + S = 22, which gives us A + (C - 12) = 22.

Simplifying the equation gives A + C = 34.

We can now solve for the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A.

Since A + C = 34, we can rewrite the equation as C = 34 - A.

Substituting C = 34 - A into the equation C - A, we get (34 - A) - A = 34 - 2A.

Simplifying the expression gives -2A + 34 = 34 - 2A.

Subtracting 34 from both sides gives -2A = -2A.

However, this is a contradiction, indicating that the initial assumption that A + S = 22 is incorrect.

"To determine the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the total weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is given by the product of the number of crayons and the weight of each crayon: $200 \cdot 1 = 200$ ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 200 crayons, we need to find the number of boxes required to accommodate all the crayons. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: $\frac{200}{8} = 25$ boxes.

Now, we can find the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is given by the product of the number of boxes and the weight of each box: $25 \cdot 8 = 200$ ounces.

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes: $200 + 200 = 400$ ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: $\frac{400}{16} = 25$ pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total revenue generated from selling the planks, we first need to calculate the number of logs that can be obtained from the 80-foot tree. Given that John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we can express this as a percentage of the total length.

Let's denote the total length of the tree as $L = 80$ feet. The length of the logs, $L_{logs}$, is then given by $L_{logs} = 0.8L = 0.8 \times 80 = 64$ feet.

Since each log has a length of 4 feet, the number of logs, $N_{logs}$, can be calculated as $N_{logs} = \frac{L_{logs}}{4} = \frac{64}{4} = 16$.

From each log, John cuts 5 planks, so the total number of planks, $N_{planks}$, is given by $N_{planks} = N_{logs} \times 5 = 16 \times 5 = 80$.

The revenue generated from selling each plank is $1.2. Therefore, the total revenue, $R$, is given by $R = N_{planks} \times 1.2 = 80 \times 1.2 = 96$ dollars.

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables and establishing the relationships between Valerie's, her brother's, and their mother's salaries.

Let's denote Valerie's monthly salary as V, her brother's monthly salary as B, and their mother's monthly salary as M. We are given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, so V = $5000. We also know that Valerie's brother earns 2 times what Valerie earns, so B = 2V = 2($5000) = $10,000.

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is V + B = $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000. We are told that their mother earns twice their combined salary, so M = 2(V + B) = 2($15,000) = $30,000.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we can simply add their individual salaries: V + B + M = $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we can apply the concept of uniform motion and the formula distance = speed × time. 

Let's denote the speed of Grandma's walk on the beach as $v_b$ miles per minute and the speed on the sidewalk as $v_s$ miles per minute. We are given that $v_s = 2v_b$.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes. Using the formula distance = speed × time, we can write the equation $2 = v_b \times 40$. Solving for $v_b$, we get $v_b = \frac{1}{20}$ miles per minute.

Now that we know the speed on the beach, we can find the speed on the sidewalk, which is $v_s = 2v_b = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10}$ miles per minute.

The time spent on the sidewalk can be calculated using the formula time = distance/speed. The distance is 1 mile and the speed is $\frac{1}{10}$ miles per minute. So, the time spent on the sidewalk is $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10$ minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is $40 + 10 = 50$ minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of additional weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal of $60, we can use a simple linear equation. Let's denote the number of weeks she has already saved as $w_1 = 8$ and the amount she saves per week as $r = 4$. The total amount she has saved so far is given by the equation:

$$
S_1 = r \cdot w_1 = 4 \cdot 8 = 32
$$

The total amount she wants to save is $S_2 = 60$. To find the number of additional weeks she needs to save, we can set up the equation:

$$
S_2 = S_1 + r \cdot w_2
$$

where $w_2$ is the number of additional weeks she needs to save. Rearranging the equation to solve for $w_2$, we get:

$$
w_2 = \frac{S_2 - S_1}{r} = \frac{60 - 32}{4} = \frac{28}{4} = 7
$$

Therefore, Jane needs to save for 7 more weeks to reach her goal of $60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total number of blue birds, we can apply basic principles of arithmetic. 

First, we identify the number of blue birds in each group of trees. Three trees have 7 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 3 * 7 = 21. 

Next, we consider the two trees that have 4 blue birds each, resulting in a total of 2 * 4 = 8 blue birds.

Lastly, we account for the tree with 3 blue birds.

To find the total number of blue birds, we sum the number of blue birds in each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic reasoning.

Let x be the initial number of marbles Bob has. If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 × 12 = 24. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 24 = 60

To solve for x, we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we need to find the number of marbles he will have. To do this, we subtract 10 from 36:

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we can apply the concept of weighted averages. Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces.

The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle). The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2.

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2 * 5. Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees.

We can set up the inequality (33 + x) / 2 * 5 ≥ 40. Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

(33 + x) * 5 ≥ 80

Expanding the left side of the inequality, we get:

165 + 5x ≥ 80

Subtracting 165 from both sides, we get:

5x ≥ -85

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

x ≥ -17

However, since temperature cannot be negative, the minimum value of x that satisfies the condition is the smallest possible value that is greater than or equal to -17. In this case, the minimum value of x is 40 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Let's start by calculating the number of cows. Melanie's father begins with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. The number of cows added in three weeks can be calculated as follows:

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days
= 20 * 21
= 420 cows

Now, we can find the total number of cows by adding the initial number of cows to the number of cows added:

Total number of cows = 50 cows + 420 cows
= 470 cows

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. The number of chickens added in three weeks can be calculated as follows:

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days
= 10 * 21
= 210 chickens

Now, we can find the total number of chickens by adding the initial number of chickens to the number of chickens added:

Total number of chickens = 20 chickens + 210 chickens
= 230 chickens

Finally, we can find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks by adding the total number of cows and chickens:

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"To determine the cost of each single bagel after a 10% discount on a purchase of 4 packs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the purchase before the discount. 

Given that each pack of bagels costs $10.00 and contains 9 bagels, we can calculate the total cost of 4 packs as follows:

Total cost of 4 packs = 4 \* $10.00 = $40.00

Next, we need to find the amount of the discount. Since the discount is 10% of the total cost, we can calculate it as follows:

Discount = 0.1 \* $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we can find the discounted cost by subtracting the discount from the total cost:

Discounted cost = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

To find the cost of each single bagel, we need to divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels in 4 packs. Since each pack contains 9 bagels, the total number of bagels in 4 packs is:

Total number of bagels = 4 \* 9 = 36

Cost of each single bagel = $36.00 / 36 = $1.00

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To determine the number of potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to establish the relationship between scoops of mashed potatoes and the number of potatoes required to make them. It is given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's denote the number of potatoes required to make 1 less than 3 scoops as $x$. Then, we have the equation $x = 6 - 3$, which simplifies to $x = 3$. This means that it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we are given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's denote the number of scoops Gomer ate as $y$. Then, we have the equation $y = 23 - 5$, which simplifies to $y = 18$.

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, we can find the number of potatoes Gomer ate by dividing the total number of scoops by 2 and then multiplying by 3. This can be expressed as $\frac{y}{2} \cdot 3$.

Substituting $y = 18$ into the equation, we get $\frac{18}{2} \cdot 3 = 9 \cdot 3 = 27$.

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester consumes 3 eggs per day. This can be calculated as follows:

3 eggs/day * 30 days = 3 \* 30 = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day. This can be calculated as follows:

5 eggs/day * 30 days = 5 \* 30 = 150 eggs

To find the total number of eggs consumed over the 60-day period, we add the number of eggs consumed in the first 30 days to the number of eggs consumed in the next 30 days:

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, we can find the number of dozens by dividing the total number of eggs by 12:

Total number of dozens = 240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of blue jellybeans in the jar, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of blue jellybeans as B, the number of green jellybeans as G, and the number of red jellybeans as R.

We are given that G = 17 and R = 2G. The total number of jellybeans is 60, so we can express this as an equation: B + G + R = 60.

Substituting the given values for G and R, we get B + 17 + 2(17) = 60.

Simplifying the equation, we have B + 17 + 34 = 60.

Combining like terms, we get B + 51 = 60.

To isolate B, we subtract 51 from both sides of the equation: B = 60 - 51.

Therefore, B = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we can employ a straightforward approach by first calculating the annual yield and then extrapolating it over the specified time period.

Given that Tim grows 5 trees, each yielding 6 lemons per year, we can express this relationship as a simple multiplication problem:

Let T represent the number of trees, L represent the number of lemons per tree, and Y represent the number of years. The total number of lemons collected in a year (L_total) can be calculated as follows:

L_total = T × L
L_total = 5 × 6
L_total = 30 lemons/year

To find the total number of lemons collected in a decade (10 years), we can multiply the annual yield by the number of years:

Total lemons in a decade = L_total × Y
Total lemons in a decade = 30 lemons/year × 10 years
Total lemons in a decade = 300 lemons

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is 300."
"Given the ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9, we can express the total number of passengers as a sum of the parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 9 = 14. 

Let's denote the common multiplier as x. The number of men on the bus is 5x, and the number of women is 9x. The total number of passengers is given as 84, so we can set up the equation 5x + 9x = 84.

Combining like terms, we get 14x = 84. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 14: x = 84 / 14 = 6.

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of women on the bus: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54.

Since 20 women alighted from the bus, the number of women who remained is 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the total number of sunflowers sold by Faraday, we need to calculate the number of sunflowers sold from individual sales and bouquet sales separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold from individual sales. We know that Faraday earns $26 from individual sunflower sales per day and each sunflower costs $2. We can calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from individual sales as follows:

$$\text{Number of sunflowers sold per day from individual sales} = \frac{\text{Daily earnings from individual sales}}{\text{Cost per sunflower}}$$

$$\text{Number of sunflowers sold per day from individual sales} = \frac{\$26}{\$2} = 13$$

Next, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold from bouquet sales. We know that Faraday earns $56 from bouquet sales per day and each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers. We can calculate the number of bouquets sold per day as follows:

$$\text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Daily earnings from bouquet sales}}{\text{Cost per bouquet}}$$

$$\text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\$56}{\$8} = 7$$

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, we can calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquet sales as follows:

$$\text{Number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquet sales} = \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \times \text{Number of sunflowers per bouquet}$$

$$\text{Number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquet sales} = 7 \times 12 = 84$$

Now, we can calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day by summing up the number of sunflowers sold from individual sales and bouquet sales:

$$\text{Total number of sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day from individual sales} + \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquet sales}$$

$$\text{Total number of sunflowers sold per day} = 13 + 84 = 97$$

Finally, we can calculate the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days by multiplying the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:

$$\text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Total number of sunflowers sold per day} \times \text{Number of days}$$

$$\text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = 97 \times 3 = 291$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{291}$"
"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

Let's start by calculating the number of rocks Adam can buy with his initial investment of $100. Since each rock costs $5, we can use the formula:

Number of rocks = Total investment / Cost per rock
= $100 / $5
= 20 rocks

Next, we need to find the number of rocks Adam sells. Since he sells 60% of his inventory, we can calculate this as:

Number of rocks sold = 0.6 × Number of rocks
= 0.6 × 20
= 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

Revenue = Number of rocks sold × Price per rock
= 12 × $7
= $84

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam buys 20 rocks at $5 each, the total cost is:

Total cost = Number of rocks × Cost per rock
= 20 × $5
= $100

However, Adam only sells 12 rocks, so he still has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

Cost of unsold rocks = Number of unsold rocks × Cost per rock
= 8 × $5
= $40

The total cost of the rocks is the sum of the cost of the rocks he sold and the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

Total cost = Cost of rocks sold + Cost of unsold rocks
= $100 + $40
= $140

To find the amount of money Adam loses, we subtract the revenue from the total cost:

Loss = Total cost - Revenue
= $140 - $84
= $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To determine the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days it will take her to complete each type of picture scene and then find the maximum of these values.

Let's denote the number of days to complete large-sized scenes as L, medium-sized scenes as M, and small-sized scenes as S. We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

L = 45 / 5 = 9 days
M = 36 / 6 = 6 days
S = 49 / 7 = 7 days

To find the total number of days, we need to consider the maximum of these values, as Lauren can work on multiple types of scenes in parallel. In this case, the maximum value is L = 9 days.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the number of eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, we calculate the total number of eggs: 3 dozen eggs * 12 eggs/dozen = 36 eggs.

Next, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children: 36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs per child.

Therefore, each child receives 9 eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total cost of food for Jen's fish in May, we need to calculate the daily expenditure and then multiply it by the number of days in the month.

First, we establish the daily cost of food for the fish. Since each fish requires $1 worth of food per day, and Jen has 3 fish, the total daily expenditure is 3 \* $1 = $3.

Next, we need to account for the number of days in May, which is 31. To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days: $3 \* 31 = $93.

Therefore, the total cost of food for Jen's fish in May is $93.

The final answer is: $93"
"To determine the current number of roses Patricia possesses, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. Initially, Patricia has 30 roses. She then donates 24 roses to her mother, resulting in a reduction of her rose collection. This can be represented as:

30 (initial roses) - 24 (roses given away) = 6

Subsequently, Patricia acquires 15 additional roses, which can be added to the remaining roses:

6 (remaining roses) + 15 (new roses) = 21

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine Sid's average speed, we can utilize the formula for average speed, which is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. 

Given that Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours and an additional 140 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate the total distance and time as follows:

Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour

Therefore, Sid's average speed is 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we can apply the concept of independent events in probability theory. 

Given that the first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, we can express this as a decimal: P(A) = 0.2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is P(B) = 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Since the two events are independent, we can find the probability of both events occurring by multiplying their individual probabilities: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the number of seashells collected by each individual. Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carrey as R, the number collected by Carlos as C, and the number collected by Jim as J.

From the given information, we know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so we can express this as J = C + 5. We are also given that Jim collected 27 seashells, so we can write the equation C + 5 = 27.

Solving for C, we get C = 22. This means that Carlos collected 22 seashells.

We are also told that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, we can express this as C = 2R. Substituting the value of C, we get 22 = 2R. Solving for R, we find that R = 11.

Now that we know the number of seashells collected by each individual, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the individual counts: J + C + R = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60.

To find out how many seashells each person gets when they divide the total number of seashells equally among themselves, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3 (the number of people): 60 ÷ 3 = 20.

Therefore, each person gets 20 seashells.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we can break down his consumption into two categories: weekdays and the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays, which comprise 5 days (Monday to Friday). Therefore, the total number of carrots he consumes on weekdays can be calculated as follows:

Total carrots on weekdays = 4 carrots/day × 5 days = 4 × 5 = 20 carrots

On the weekend, Mason eats 5 carrots each day on both Saturday and Sunday. Thus, the total number of carrots he consumes on the weekend is:

Total carrots on the weekend = 5 carrots/day × 2 days = 5 × 2 = 10 carrots

To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we add the total number of carrots he consumes on weekdays and the weekend:

Total carrots in a week = Total carrots on weekdays + Total carrots on the weekend
= 20 carrots + 10 carrots
= 30 carrots

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song. Given that it is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes, we can express this relationship as an equation.

Let x be the length of the first song. The second song is 60% longer, which can be represented as x + 0.6x = 1.6x. Therefore, the length of the second song is 1.6x.

We are given that the first song is 5 minutes, so we can substitute x = 5 into the equation for the second song:

Length of the second song = 1.6x = 1.6(5) = 8 minutes

Now that we have the lengths of both songs, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs:

Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
= 5 minutes + 8 minutes
= 13 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the total profit earned by Linus from selling the mobile devices, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then sum them together.

Let's denote the cost price of a single device as CP and the selling price as SP. Given that Linus buys the devices for $20 and sells them for twice the original price, we have:

CP = $20
SP = 2 * CP = 2 * $20 = $40

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices, so the total cost price is 2 * CP = 2 * $20 = $40. The total selling price for Monday is 2 * SP = 2 * $40 = $80. Therefore, the profit for Monday is SP - CP = $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices, so the total cost price is 4 * CP = 4 * $20 = $80. The total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * SP = 4 * $40 = $160. Consequently, the profit for Tuesday is SP - CP = $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we can establish a series of relationships between the heights of Carl, Ned, and Isabel.

Given that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, we can express Ned's height as:

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, we can express Carl's height as:

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Now, we are told that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, we can express the length of Carl's cane as:

Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

"To determine the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to meet the energy demands of one person. Given that each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the number of bottles needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand as follows:

Let x be the number of bottles needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand. Since each juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we can set up the following proportion:

20% = 1/5 = 0.2
100% = x

To find x, we can divide 100 by 20% (or 0.2) to get the number of bottles needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand:

x = 100 / 0.2
x = 500

Now, to find the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can multiply the number of bottles needed for one person by the total number of people:

Total bottles needed = 500 * 2300
Total bottles needed = 1150000

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find the number of additional bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production:

Additional bottles needed = 1150000 - 4200
Additional bottles needed = 1145800

The final answer is: 1145800"
"To determine the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we can use a Venn diagram or a probability approach. Let's consider the total number of babies as 8, with 3/4 of them wearing purple and 1/4 wearing blue.

Number of babies wearing purple: $\frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6$
Number of babies wearing blue: $\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2$

We are given that all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple-wearers also wear bows. Therefore, the number of babies wearing purple and bows is $\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2$, and the number of babies wearing blue and bows is 2.

Total number of babies wearing bows: $2 + 2 = 4$

Now, we can find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:

$\frac{\text{Number of babies wearing purple and bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5$

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

$0.5 \times 100 = 50\%$

Therefore, the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of tax reports received by the IRS on Wednesday, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday as M + T, and the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday as T + F. We are given that the total number of reports received last week is 5168, and the sum of reports received on Monday and Tuesday is 1907, while the sum of reports received on Thursday and Friday is 2136.

We can express this information as a system of equations:

M + T = 1907
T + F = 2136
M + T + T + F = 5168

Simplifying the third equation, we get:
M + 2T + F = 5168

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the simplified third equation to eliminate M:
(1907 - T) + 2T + F = 5168

Combine like terms:
1907 + T + F = 5168

Subtract 1907 from both sides:
T + F = 5168 - 1907
T + F = 3261

Now, we can substitute the expression for T + F into the second equation:
T + F = 3261
2136 = 3261

However, this is not correct. We need to find the value of T + F. We can do this by subtracting the sum of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received last week:
M + T + T + F = 5168
M + 2T + F = 5168
M + T = 1907
2T + F = 5168 - 1907
2T + F = 3261

Now, we can solve for T + F:
T + F = 3261

However, we need to find the value of T + F. We can do this by subtracting the sum of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received last week:
T + F = 5168 - 1907
T + F = 3261

Now, we can find the number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the sum of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the sum of reports received on Thursday and Friday:
Reports received on Wednesday = (T + F) - (M + T)
Reports received on Wednesday = 3261 - 1907
Reports received on Wednesday = 1354

The final answer is: 1354"
"To determine the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to calculate the revenue generated from each sale and sum them up.

First, let's calculate the area of land sold in the first transaction. Since Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50, we can express this as:

$$\frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ square meters}$$

The revenue from the first sale is $50.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. The area of land sold in the second transaction is:

$$\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \text{ square meters}$$

The revenue from the second sale is $30.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. The revenue from the third sale is:

$$20 \times 3 = 60$$

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. We add the revenues from the three sales:

$$50 + 30 + 60 = 140$$

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling all his unused land is $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To determine Geb's age, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Geb's age as 'G' and Haley's age as 'H'. We are given that Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

G = (1/2)H - 10

Given that Haley is 26 years old, we can substitute H = 26 into the equation:

G = (1/2)(26) - 10

To solve for G, we first calculate half of 26:

(1/2)(26) = 13

Now, we substitute this value back into the equation:

G = 13 - 10

Performing the subtraction, we find:

G = 3

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"To determine the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the total number of face masks he uses in a day and then multiply it by 2.

Given that Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day can be calculated as follows:

Face masks used per day = Number of times face mask is changed per outing × Number of outings per day
= 2 × 3
= 6

Now, to find the total number of face masks used every 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks used per day by 2:

Total face masks used every 2 days = Face masks used per day × 2
= 6 × 2
= 12

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we can approach this problem by first calculating the total number of eggs found by each individual and then subtracting that from the initial number of eggs hidden.

Let's denote the number of eggs found by Lamar as L, Stacy as S, Charlie as C, and Mei as M. We are given the following information:

- L = 5
- S = 2L = 2(5) = 10
- C = S - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8
- M = C/2 = 8/2 = 4

Now, we can calculate the total number of eggs found by adding the individual counts: L + S + C + M = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27.

Since Cole initially hid 3 dozen eggs, we can convert this to a numerical value by multiplying 3 by 12 (since 1 dozen is equal to 12): 3 × 12 = 36.

To find the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we need to calculate the total number of apartments and the total amount he collects per week.

First, let's find the size of the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 2 \* 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 \* 400 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

So, the total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, he collects from 1040 \* 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 \* 0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To determine the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10-year lifespan, we can analyze the given information and apply mathematical principles to derive the solution.

Let's denote the initial number of fruits produced by a 5-year-old tree as $F$. According to the problem statement, a 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is $3F$. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, resulting in $7F$ fruits. 

We are also given that an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let's denote the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree as $x$. Therefore, the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree is $x - 200$.

The problem also states that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is $20F$. Since we know that a 10-year-old tree produces $x$ fruits, we can equate these two expressions to find the value of $x$:

$$20F = x$$

We are also given that a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits. Therefore, we can substitute this value for $x$ in the equation above:

$$20F = 1000$$

Solving for $F$, we get:

$$F = \frac{1000}{20} = 50$$

Now that we have the value of $F$, we can find the number of fruits produced by each age of the tree:

- Year 1 (5 years old): $F = 50$ fruits
- Year 2 (6 years old): $3F = 3 \cdot 50 = 150$ fruits
- Year 3 (7 years old): $7F = 7 \cdot 50 = 350$ fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): $x - 200 = 1000 - 200 = 800$ fruits
- Year 5 (9 years old): $0$ fruits (no production)
- Year 6 (10 years old): $x = 1000$ fruits

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:

$$\text{Total Fruits} = F + 3F + 7F + (x - 200) + 0 + x$$

Substituting the values of $F$ and $x$, we get:

$$\text{Total Fruits} = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 1550$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{1550}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jack has after Sophia gives him 1/5 of her $100, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic operation.

First, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100. This can be expressed as a fraction: $\frac{1}{5} \cdot 100$. To simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 20, which yields $\frac{20}{100}$. Since $\frac{20}{100}$ can be further reduced by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 20, we obtain $\frac{1}{5}$.

Now, we can calculate the value of $\frac{1}{5}$ of $100 by multiplying the fraction by $100: \frac{1}{5} \cdot 100 = \frac{100}{5} = 20$. Therefore, Sophia gives Jack $20.

To find the total amount of money Jack has now, we add the $20 he received from Sophia to his initial $100: $100 + $20 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the lengths of the three ropes. Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R.

Given that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, we can express this relationship as R = 4B. Additionally, we know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, which can be represented as B = Y - 7.

We are also given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Given that Ronnie was given $5 and Rissa was given thrice as much, we can express Rissa's initial amount as $15. 

Let's denote the amount given to their little sister as 'x'. After giving 'x' dollars to their sister, Ronnie is left with $5 - x, and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, which can be expressed as:

$$15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \cdot 15$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$15 - x = 12$$

Solving for x, we get:

$$x = 15 - 12$$
$$x = 3$$

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with:

$$\text{Ronnie's remaining money} = 5 - x = 5 - 3 = 2$$

The final answer is: $2"
"Given that the wall mural consists of four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow, and that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can denote the amount of each of these colors as x. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is comprised of the remaining three colors. 

Let's denote the total amount of paint used as P. We are given that P = 12 pints. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is 6 pints (P/2 = 12/2 = 6). This 6 pints is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x (since there are three colors with equal amounts).

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6/3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total area of Tom's house, we must first calculate the area of each component and then sum them up.

The area of a rectangle, such as a bedroom, is given by the product of its length and width. In this case, each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so its area is $A_{\text{bedroom}} = l \times w = 20 \times 12 = 240$ square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is $A_{\text{bedrooms}} = 4 \times A_{\text{bedroom}} = 4 \times 240 = 960$ square feet.

The living room is stated to be 5 times larger than a bedroom, so its area is $A_{\text{living room}} = 5 \times A_{\text{bedroom}} = 5 \times 240 = 1200$ square feet.

The remaining area of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we sum the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area: $A_{\text{total}} = A_{\text{bedrooms}} + A_{\text{living room}} + A_{\text{remaining}} = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160$ square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3160}$"
"To determine the total number of clouds Alice counted over the five-day period, we can utilize a geometric progression formula. A geometric progression is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.

In this scenario, the first term (a) is 3 (the number of clouds on Monday), and the common ratio (r) is 2, as the number of clouds doubles each day. The formula to find the nth term of a geometric progression is given by:

an = a * r^(n-1)

We need to find the sum of the first five terms of this geometric progression. The formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression is:

Sn = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where Sn is the sum of the first n terms, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

Plugging in the values, we get:

a = 3
r = 2
n = 5

Sn = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
Sn = 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1)
Sn = 3 * (-31) / (-1)
Sn = 93

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice counted over the five-day period is 93.

The final answer is: 93"
"To determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box for $1, we first need to calculate the number of pods in the new box. Given that the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can express this as a mathematical equation:

Let x be the number of pods in the regular box. Then, the number of pods in the new box is x + 20% of x, which is equivalent to x + 0.2x = 1.2x.

We are given that the regular box contains 100 pods. Therefore, the number of pods in the new box is 1.2 * 100 = 120 pods.

Now, we can calculate the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box for $12, which is the same price as the regular box. Since each cycle requires one pod, the number of cycles is equal to the number of pods in the new box, which is 120.

To find the number of cycles that can be run for $1, we divide the total number of cycles by 12:

$$\frac{120}{12} = 10$$

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box for $1 is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a series of steps, analyzing the transformation of Thomas's money through each stage.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

When he loses 10 bills, he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Next, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is equivalent to 40 / 2 = 20 bills. Therefore, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

He then triples his money, which is equivalent to tripling the number of bills. This results in 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

Therefore, the number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has is 60.

The final numerical answer is: 60"
"To determine the total number of goals scored in the soccer match, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first half and the second half.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Since team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, we can express this as $B_1 = A_1 - 2$, where $B_1$ is the number of goals scored by team B in the first half and $A_1$ is the number of goals scored by team A in the first half. Substituting the value of $A_1$, we get $B_1 = 4 - 2 = 2$ goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is $B_2 = 4B_1 = 4(2) = 8$ goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is $A_2 = \frac{1}{4}B_2 = \frac{1}{4}(8) = 2$ goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is $A_1 + A_2 = 4 + 2 = 6$ goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is $B_1 + B_2 = 2 + 8 = 10$ goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is $A_1 + A_2 + B_1 + B_2 = 4 + 2 + 2 + 8 = 16$ goals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate the remaining length of the chalk after Monday and then find out how many days it will last at a rate of 20% per day.

Initially, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, so the remaining chalk is 55% of the original 5 inches.

Let's calculate the remaining length of the chalk:

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let 'x' be the number of days the chalk will last. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk."
"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 12 = 4$.
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 12 = 3$.

The total number of students on varsity is $4 + 3 = 7$.

The total number of students in the class is $12 + 12 = 24$.

The number of students not on varsity is $24 - 7 = 17$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of face masks Johnny bought, we can start by identifying the number of face masks Mike purchased. Given that Mike bought 5 face masks, we can then calculate three times this amount to find the baseline for Johnny's purchase.

Let's denote the number of face masks Mike bought as M = 5. 

Three times the amount Mike bought is 3M = 3(5) = 15.

Since Johnny bought 2 more face masks than three times the amount Mike bought, we can express this as 3M + 2. Substituting the value of 3M, we get 3(5) + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17.

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the total number of teeth the dentist treats and then express it as a percentage of the total number of teeth James has.

The dentist drills 4 teeth, which is a straightforward procedure. However, the dentist also caps 7 more teeth than he drills. This implies that the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11.

Therefore, the total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth drilled and capped, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we can use the formula:

Percentage = (Number of teeth fixed / Total number of teeth) * 100

Substituting the values, we get:

Percentage = (15 / 30) * 100

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 15:

Percentage = (1 / 2) * 100

Now, we can evaluate the expression:

Percentage = 0.5 * 100
= 50%

Therefore, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus is eligible for a refund, we need to calculate the quantity of milk that has expired. Given that 2/5 of the 4000 gallons of milk sold to him have passed the expiry date, we can compute this as follows:

Let's denote the total quantity of milk sold as Q = 4000 gallons. The fraction of milk that has expired is 2/5, so the quantity of expired milk is:

Q_expired = (2/5) * Q = (2/5) * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons

Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the total refund will be the cost per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons returned:

Refund = Q_expired * Cost_per_gallon = 1600 * 3.5 = 5600

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus is eligible for a refund of $5600.

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C. We can express the given information as a system of linear equations.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

Therefore, Colin's current age is 20 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of books Bob can purchase for each school, we first need to calculate the total number of books he can buy with his allocated funds. Given that he has $27,000 and can purchase 100 books for $500, we can calculate the total number of books as follows:

Total number of books = Total funds / Cost per 100 books
Total number of books = $27,000 / $500
Total number of books = 54

Since Bob is distributing the funds to 3 schools, we can calculate the number of books he can purchase for each school by dividing the total number of books by the number of schools:

Number of books per school = Total number of books / Number of schools
Number of books per school = 54 / 3
Number of books per school = 18

Therefore, Bob can purchase 18 books for each school.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"Let's analyze the situation using a step-by-step approach, considering the sequence of events and the resulting changes in the number of apples.

Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked up these 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw the other apple back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. This action can be represented as follows:

Let's denote the initial number of apples as A. After picking up the 2 apples, Newton has A - 1 apples left in the tree. Throwing 1 apple back into the tree results in 5 more apples falling out, so the total number of apples in the tree becomes A - 1 + 5 = A + 4. However, Newton now has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples, for a total of 6 apples.

Now, let's consider the next step. Newton puts all but 1 of the new apples in his pocket, leaving 1 apple outside. This means he has 1 apple outside and 5 apples in his pocket, for a total of 6 apples.

The next event is that Newton throws the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. This can be represented as follows:

Let's denote the number of apples in the tree after the previous step as B. After throwing the apple, the number of apples in the tree becomes B + 6. However, Newton now has 6 apples from the previous step and 6 new apples, for a total of 12 apples.

To find the total number of apples Newton brought home, we need to consider the number of apples he had after the last event. Since he picked up all the remaining apples, the total number of apples he brought home is the sum of the apples he had in his pocket and the apples he picked up from the tree.

The total number of apples Newton brought home is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to calculate the number of bags of coal he purchased and then multiply it by the cost per bag.

First, we calculate the number of bags by dividing the total weight of coal (in kilograms) by the weight per bag (also in kilograms).

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Next, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost.

Cost per bag = $18
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 * $18
= $306

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will consume. Given that each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, and there are 6 friends, we can calculate the total number of slices of each type of pizza as follows:

Total cheese pizza slices = 6 slices/friend * 6 friends = 36 slices
Total pepperoni pizza slices = 4 slices/friend * 6 friends = 24 slices

Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices and each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we can determine the number of pizzas needed for each type as follows:

Number of cheese pizzas = Total cheese pizza slices / 12 slices/pizza = 36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas
Number of pepperoni pizzas = Total pepperoni pizza slices / 8 slices/pizza = 24 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, which is equivalent to 6 pizzas in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total miles Sam ran this week, we can calculate the miles he ran on each day and then sum them up.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. This can be represented as 3 \* 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. This can be represented as 5 \* 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we can add the miles from both sets of days to find the total miles Sam ran: 9 + 10 = 19 miles.

Therefore, the total miles Sam ran this week is 19 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the time it will take Jay to accumulate 60 snowballs, we must consider the rates at which he builds and loses snowballs. Jay constructs snowballs at a rate of 20 per hour, which is equivalent to 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute. Conversely, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, resulting in a melting rate of 2/15 snowballs per minute.

The net rate of snowball accumulation can be calculated by subtracting the melting rate from the building rate: 

$$\frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{5}{15} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5}$$

This indicates that Jay accumulates snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute.

To find the time required to accumulate 60 snowballs, we can use the formula:

$$t = \frac{n}{r}$$

where $t$ is the time, $n$ is the number of snowballs, and $r$ is the net rate of accumulation.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$t = \frac{60}{\frac{1}{5}} = 60 \times 5 = 300$$

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to accumulate 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine Jim's current age, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Jim's age 20 years ago as 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can express John's age 20 years ago as 2x.

We are given that John is currently 28 years old. Therefore, 20 years ago, John's age would be 28 - 20 = 8 years old. This allows us to set up the equation 2x = 8, where x represents Jim's age 20 years ago.

Solving for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2, yielding x = 4. This means Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago.

To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age 20 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24.

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple arithmetic progression to determine the number of slices each person ate. Let's denote the number of slices Doxa ate as x. Since her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, her sister ate x + 1 slices. Similarly, her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so he ate x + 2 slices.

We are given that Doxa ate 1 slice, so we can set up the equation x = 1. 

Now, we can find the number of slices her sister and brother ate by substituting x = 1 into the expressions for their slices: 
- Her sister ate x + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
- Her brother ate x + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add up the number of slices each person ate: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages. This means they had x - 38 + 50 bandages left after the first day.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. Therefore, they had (x - 38 + 50) - 28 bandages left after the second day.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. This means they had ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100 bandages left after the third day.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. We can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides, we get:

x = 21

Therefore, the initial number of bandages is 21.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the total cost of May's haircut and color treatment, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut based on the difference in length and add the cost of the color treatment.

The initial length of May's hair was 10 inches, and the final length after the haircut was 8 inches. Therefore, the difference in length is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

Given that the cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, the cost for 2 inches can be calculated as follows:

2 inches \* $30/inch = $60

In addition to the haircut, May also received a color treatment, which costs $40.

Therefore, the total cost of the haircut and color treatment is $60 + $40 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate her regular pay and attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 4 * 6 = 24 days in April. Her total hours worked in April is 7.5 * 24 = 180 hours. Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular pay is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus. Jen receives an additional $10 for each day she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 24 days. Her attendance bonus is 24 * $10 = $240.

Now, let's add her regular pay and attendance bonus to find her total earnings:
Total earnings = Regular pay + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $240
Total earnings = $510

The final answer is: $510"
"To determine the total amount Jason earned, we can calculate the earnings for each task and then sum them up.

Let's denote the earnings for each task as follows:
- Laundry: $3.00 (done once)
- Cleaning the room: $1.50 (done once)
- Taking the trash out: $0.75 (done twice)
- Emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 (done 6 times)

We can express the total earnings as the sum of these individual earnings:
Total earnings = (Laundry) + (Cleaning the room) + (Taking the trash out) + (Emptying the dishwasher)
Total earnings = $3.00 + $1.50 + ($0.75 * 2) + ($0.50 * 6)

Using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can simplify the expression:
Total earnings = $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00
Total earnings = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To determine the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we must first establish the blood volume of a single shark. Given that a whale has 40 gallons of blood and a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, we can calculate the blood volume of a shark as follows:

Blood volume of a shark = 3 × Blood volume of a whale
= 3 × 40 gallons
= 120 gallons

Now, to find the total blood volume of ten sharks, we can multiply the blood volume of a single shark by the number of sharks:

Total blood volume of ten sharks = Blood volume of a shark × Number of sharks
= 120 gallons/shark × 10 sharks
= 1200 gallons

Therefore, the total amount of blood in ten sharks is 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1200}$"
"To determine the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we can break down the problem into manageable parts. Let's denote the number of people who entered in the morning as M, the number of people who entered at 10:00 as T, and the number of people who entered in the evening as E.

We are given that M = 50. At 10:00, 40 more people entered, so T = 40. We are also told that the number of people who entered for lunch is twice the number who entered at 10:00, which is 2T = 2(40) = 80. Finally, the number of people who entered in the evening is three times the number who entered in the morning, which is 3M = 3(50) = 150.

Now, we can calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant by adding up the number of people who entered at each time:
Total = M + T + 2T + 3M
Total = 50 + 40 + 80 + 150
Total = 320

The final answer is: 320"
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and the number of black pens.

First, we know that Alain's mom purchased 5 packs of red pens. Given that each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Furthermore, we are informed that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the total cost of John's purchase, we need to calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately and then add them together.

Let's start by finding the cost per bottle of scotch. Given that the total cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles, we can calculate the cost per bottle as follows:

$$\frac{\text{Total Cost of Scotch}}{\text{Number of Bottles of Scotch}} = \frac{\$600}{10} = \$60$$

Now, let's consider the cognac. We are told that the number of bottles of cognac is twice the number of bottles of scotch, which is 2 * 10 = 20 bottles. Additionally, the cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, which means the cost per bottle of cognac is 1.5 times the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

$$\text{Cost per Bottle of Cognac} = 1.5 \times \text{Cost per Bottle of Scotch} = 1.5 \times \$60 = \$90$$

Now that we have the cost per bottle of cognac, we can find the total cost of the cognac by multiplying the cost per bottle by the number of bottles:

$$\text{Total Cost of Cognac} = \text{Cost per Bottle of Cognac} \times \text{Number of Bottles of Cognac} = \$90 \times 20 = \$1800$$

Finally, to find the total cost of John's purchase, we add the total cost of the scotch and the cognac:

$$\text{Total Cost} = \text{Total Cost of Scotch} + \text{Total Cost of Cognac} = \$600 + \$1800 = \$2400$$

The final answer is: $2400"
"To determine the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of White Oak trees and the number of Lodgepole Pine trees.

Let's start with the White Oak trees. On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 trees. On the second day, he planted 10 more, resulting in a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.

Next, we'll consider the Lodgepole Pine trees. On the first day, Mr. Julius planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 trees. On the second day, he planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 trees. Therefore, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, we can calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius by adding the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees:

Total number of trees = 30 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 120

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the amount of root beer available for each person to drink at the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the incidents and then divide it by the number of people at the party.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were stolen by his children, so the remaining amount is $24 - 4 = 20$ gallons.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so the remaining amount is $20 - 7 = 13$ gallons.

On the third day, 5 gallons were taken by Ronnie, so the remaining amount is $13 - 5 = 8$ gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find the amount each person got, we divide the remaining amount by the number of people: $\frac{8}{3} = 2\frac{2}{3}$ gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic manipulation to isolate the variable representing the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge. The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be expressed as the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation, which yields:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we can express this as a fraction:

$$\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = \frac{66}{3} = 22$$

Next, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish:

$$66 - 22 = 44$$

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. We are given that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. To calculate this, we can multiply the number of fish without red stripes by 5/11:

$$\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = \frac{5 \times 44}{11} = \frac{220}{11} = 20$$

Finally, we can find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes by adding the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

$$22 + 20 = 42$$

Therefore, the total number of fish with red and blue stripes is 42.

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"To determine the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to consider the initial number of eyeshadow colors she possessed and the subsequent changes to that number.

Initially, Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, which gives us a total of $2 \times 4 = 8$ eyeshadow colors from the palettes. Additionally, she had three makeup sets, each containing six eyeshadow colors, resulting in a total of $3 \times 6 = 18$ eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets. Therefore, Amy's initial total number of eyeshadow colors is $8 + 18 = 26$.

When her sister steals one of the palettes, Amy loses 4 eyeshadow colors, leaving her with $26 - 4 = 22$ eyeshadow colors.

Subsequently, Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which contains 6 eyeshadow colors. Half of 6 is $\frac{6}{2} = 3$, so she uses up 3 eyeshadow colors. This leaves her with $22 - 3 = 19$ eyeshadow colors.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we can break down the given information into a series of steps.

Let's denote Mattison's height as $h_M = 60$ inches. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so its total height is $h_{\text{total}} = 7h_M = 7 \cdot 60 = 420$ inches.

The floor-to-ceiling height of the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, which is $h_1 = 3h_M = 3 \cdot 60 = 180$ inches.

Now, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the first floor's height from the total height of the house:
$h_2 = h_{\text{total}} - h_1 = 420 - 180 = 240$ inches.

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to determine the height of the second floor to the ceiling, which is the difference between the total height of the house and the height of the second floor:
$h_{\text{roof}} = h_{\text{total}} - h_2 = 420 - 240 = 180$ inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas, which is 40% of the total shells.

Let's denote the total number of shells as $T$. Then, the number of shells found by Alphas is $0.4T$.

We are given that $T = 700$, so the number of shells found by Alphas is $0.4 \times 700 = 280$ shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas has found their share. This can be calculated as $T - 0.4T = 0.6T$.

Substituting the value of $T$, we get $0.6 \times 700 = 420$ shells remaining.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

The number of shells found by The finders is $0.6 \times 420 = 252$ shells.

Finally, we can find the number of shells found by team Gogetters by subtracting the total number of shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells.

The number of shells found by Gogetters is $T - (0.4T + 0.6T) = 0.0T = 0T$.

"To determine the miles walked by the last dog, we can use the concept of averages and total distances. Let's denote the miles walked by the last dog as x. The total miles walked by all four dogs is the sum of the individual distances, which is given by:

1 + 4 + 3 + x = 8 + x

We are also given that the average miles walked by all four dogs is 3. The average is calculated by dividing the total distance by the number of dogs, so we can set up the equation:

(1 + 4 + 3 + x) / 4 = 3

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12

Now, we can simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining the constants:

8 + x = 12

Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 4

Therefore, the last dog needs 4 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts, we need to calculate the loan amount and then subtract the amount used to pay off his debts.

First, we calculate the loan amount, which is 40% of the value of his house.

Loan Amount = 0.4 × $250,000 = $100,000

Next, we calculate the amount used to pay off his debts, which is 60% of the loan amount.

Amount Used to Pay Off Debts = 0.6 × $100,000 = $60,000

Now, we subtract the amount used to pay off his debts from the loan amount to find the leftover amount.

Leftover Amount = Loan Amount - Amount Used to Pay Off Debts
= $100,000 - $60,000
= $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To determine Deandre's total earnings from selling the tunas, we need to calculate the total weight of the tunas and then multiply it by the cost per kilogram.

The weights of the three tunas are given as 56 kilograms, 46 kilograms, and 26 kilograms. To find the total weight, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Total weight = 56 + 46 + 26

However, since this is a simple arithmetic series with three terms, we can also calculate the total weight by adding the terms directly:

Total weight = 56 + 46 + 26
Total weight = 128 kilograms

Alternatively, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: 

Total weight = (n/2) * (a1 + an)
where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, n = 3, a1 = 56, and an = 26. 

Total weight = (3/2) * (56 + 26)
Total weight = (3/2) * 82
Total weight = 3 * 41
Total weight = 123 kilograms

However, this is incorrect. The correct total weight is 128 kilograms.

Now, to find Deandre's total earnings, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram, which is $0.50.

Total earnings = Total weight * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

The final answer is: $64"
"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

Given that Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them for, we can express this as a ratio of the selling price to the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as CP and the selling price as SP. We have:

SP = (11/8) * CP

We are given that the cost price (CP) is $72. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

SP = (11/8) * 72
SP = (11 * 72) / 8
SP = 792 / 8
SP = 99

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:

Profit = SP - CP
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27.

The final answer is: $27"
"To determine the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement, we need to calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then sum these values.

Let's denote the amount of water removed per day on the low setting as L. Given that the medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, the amount of water removed per day on the medium setting is 2L. Similarly, the high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so the amount of water removed per day on the high setting is 2(2L) = 4L.

Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, so the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 3L. For the medium setting, he ran it for 3 days, resulting in a total of 3(2L) = 6L. Finally, he ran the high setting for 5 days, which yields a total of 5(4L) = 20L.

To find the total amount of water removed, we sum the individual totals: 3L + 6L + 20L = 29L.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the number of balloons thrown during the water balloon fight, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic operation. 

First, we calculate the total number of balloons by multiplying the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack: 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons.

Next, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total to find the number of balloons thrown: 300 - 12 = 288.

Therefore, the number of balloons thrown during the water balloon fight is 288."
"To determine the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we first need to calculate the amount of each medicine in one dose. The first medicine is 14 mL, and the second medicine is 3 times that amount, which is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

The total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the two medicines, which is 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8:

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL.

The final answer is: $\boxed{448}$"
"To determine the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to calculate the capacity of John's classes. Given that each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can express this as a mathematical relationship.

Let's denote the capacity of Ali's class as A = 120 students. The capacity of each of John's classes can be represented as (1/8)A. Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his classes is 2 * (1/8)A.

We can simplify this expression by first calculating (1/8)A, which is 120 / 8 = 15 students per class. Then, we multiply this by 2 to account for the two classes, resulting in a total capacity of 15 * 2 = 30 students for John's classes.

Now, to find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacity of Ali's class to the capacity of John's classes: A + 2 * (1/8)A = 120 + 30 = 150 students.

Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the amount Stephen pays in the first 11 months and the amount he pays in the twelfth month.

First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen pays in the first 11 months. Since he pays $25 per month for 11 months, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

S = n/2 * (a1 + an)

where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, n = 11, a1 = 25, and an = 25 (since the payment is constant). Plugging in these values, we get:

S = 11/2 * (25 + 25)
S = 11/2 * 50
S = 275

Now, let's calculate the total interest Stephen owes his sister. The interest rate is 2% of the initial $300, which is:

Interest = 0.02 * 300
Interest = $6

The total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the initial amount plus the interest minus the amount he paid in the first 11 months:

Total amount = 300 + 6 - 275
Total amount = $31

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine the number of diapers Jordan changes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of diaper changes required for both children. Given that each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day. This implies that Jordan changes the remaining half, which is also 5 diapers per day.

Therefore, the number of diapers Jordan changes per day is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of red jelly beans in the jar, we must first calculate the volume of the jar. Given that the jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches, we can calculate its volume as follows:

Volume = length × width × height
Volume = 6 × 6 × 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans is 80% of the total volume.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 × 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Next, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean, which is 0.15 cubic inches.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans ÷ Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 ÷ 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Given that 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans × 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 × 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to determine the number of red jelly beans he guessed. Unfortunately, the problem does not provide this information. For the sake of this problem, let's assume that Tim guessed the number of red jelly beans to be 864.

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach to track the number of people on the bus at each stop.

Let's denote the initial number of people on the bus as $n_0 = 20$. At the first stop, 40 people enter the bus, so the total number of people becomes $n_1 = n_0 + 40 = 20 + 40 = 60$.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) enter the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus becomes $n_2 = n_1 + 30 = 60 + 30 = 90$.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubles. So, the total number of people on the bus becomes $n_3 = 2n_2 = 2 \cdot 90 = 180$.

Now, we need to find the number of spaces left on the bus. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the number of spaces left is $200 - n_3 = 200 - 180 = 20$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for two distinct periods: the initial 5 years and the subsequent 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of a single visit is $2. Given that Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual expenditure is 3 \* $2 = $6. Consequently, the total cost for the initial 5-year period is 5 \* $6 = $30.

Following the 5-year period, the cost of a single visit increases by 150%. This represents a 150% increase over the original $2 cost, which is equivalent to 1.5 \* $2 = $3. Therefore, the new cost of a single visit is $2 + $3 = $5. With Pauline continuing to visit the museum 3 times a year, the annual expenditure for the subsequent 3 years is 3 \* $5 = $15. Consequently, the total cost for the next 3-year period is 3 \* $15 = $45.

To obtain the total cost for all visits, we sum the costs of the two distinct periods: $30 + $45 = $75.

The final numerical answer is: $75"
"To determine the time it will take for all students to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups required and then multiply that by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

First, we calculate the total number of students: 4 grades * 10 students per grade = 40 students.

Since each group consists of 8 students, we divide the total number of students by 8 to find the number of groups: 40 / 8 = 5.

Each group has 45 minutes to try the escape room. Therefore, the total time required for all students to try the escape room is the number of groups multiplied by the time per group: 5 groups * 45 minutes per group = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To determine the total amount Ali owes John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, then sum these two values.

The cost of the tables can be calculated as the product of the number of tables and the cost per table: 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.

Similarly, the cost of the roof frames is the product of the number of frames and the cost per frame: 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames: $80 + $20 = $100.

Therefore, Ali owes John a total of $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"Given that Ian has a board that is 40 feet long and he decides to make a cut so he can have two pieces, with the longer piece being 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we can model this situation using a linear equation.

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x. The total length of the board is 40 feet, so we can set up the following equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs for his meatballs, we must first calculate the total pounds of ground beef required to produce 80 meatballs. Given that he yields 16 meatballs per pound of meat, we can use the following proportion to find the total pounds of meat needed:

Let x be the total pounds of meat needed. Then, the proportion can be expressed as:

16 meatballs/pound = 80 meatballs / x pounds

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

16x = 80

Now, we can divide both sides by 16 to isolate x:

x = 80 / 16
x = 5

Therefore, Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef to produce 80 meatballs.

Since he adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can calculate the total seasoning needed by multiplying the total pounds of meat by the amount of seasoning per pound:

Total seasoning needed = 5 pounds * 2 tablespoons/pound
Total seasoning needed = 10 tablespoons

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount of fabric Luke should buy, we need to calculate the total width of the windows and then multiply it by 2.

First, we calculate the total width of the windows by multiplying the width of one window by the number of windows. The width of one window is given as 35 inches, and there are 5 windows.

Total width of windows = 35 inches/window × 5 windows = 35 × 5 = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we can express this as a multiplication operation.

Fabric needed = 2 × Total width of windows
Fabric needed = 2 × 175 inches
Fabric needed = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric.

The final answer is: 350"
"To determine the cost of a 36-minute call from a payphone, we need to consider the rate change after 16 minutes. The initial rate is $0.25 per minute for the first 16 minutes, and the reduced rate is $0.2 per minute for the remaining minutes.

The cost for the first 16 minutes can be calculated as follows:

$$\text{Cost}_\text{initial} = 16 \times 0.25 = 4$$

The remaining time is 36 - 16 = 20 minutes. The cost for the remaining minutes can be calculated as:

$$\text{Cost}_\text{remaining} = 20 \times 0.2 = 4$$

The total cost of the call is the sum of the initial and remaining costs:

$$\text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost}_\text{initial} + \text{Cost}_\text{remaining} = 4 + 4 = 8$$

Therefore, the total cost of a 36-minute call from a payphone is $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to calculate the amount of rain on Monday and then find twice that amount, and add 1 inch to it.

Let's denote the amount of rain on Monday as M. Given that M = 2 inches, we can proceed to calculate the amount of rain on Tuesday.

The amount of rain on Tuesday is expected to be 1 more inch than twice the amount of rain on Monday. Mathematically, this can be represented as 2M + 1.

Substituting the value of M, we get 2(2) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

Therefore, the total inches of rain on Tuesday is 5 inches."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as x. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Therefore, the number of brownies can be represented as 3x - 2.

Since each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10. The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

Now, let's solve the equation:

x + 3x - 2 = 10
4x - 2 = 10
4x = 12
x = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total cost of the services, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure. The original prices are $35 for the manicure and $40 for the pedicure. A 20% discount is applied to both services.

The discount on the manicure is 20% of $35, which can be calculated as 0.20 \* 35 = $7. Similarly, the discount on the pedicure is 20% of $40, which is 0.20 \* 40 = $8.

The total discount is the sum of the discounts on the manicure and pedicure, which is $7 + $8 = $15.

The discounted price of the manicure is the original price minus the discount, which is $35 - $7 = $28. The discounted price of the pedicure is $40 - $8 = $32.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is the sum of their discounted prices, which is $28 + $32 = $60.

To calculate the cost of the nail art, we need to consider that there are 10 fingers, and each nail requires a $3 charge. Therefore, the total cost of the nail art is 10 \* $3 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is the sum of their individual costs, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final numerical answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of magazines Susan receives annually, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and sum them up.

Let's denote the number of issues from the first 3 magazines as 12i, where i is the number of magazines. Since there are 3 magazines, the total number of issues from these magazines is 12 * 3 = 36.

The second magazine sends 6 issues per year.

The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives a total of 66 magazines per year.

The final answer is: 66"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of paintings each person has. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as K, the number of paintings Shelley has as S, and the number of paintings Samantha has as A.

From the given information, we can write the following equations:

1. A = S - 12 (Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley)
2. S = K + 8 (Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim)
3. A = 27 (Samantha has 27 paintings)

We can substitute equation (3) into equation (1) to get:

27 = S - 12

Solving for S, we get:

S = 27 + 12
S = 39

Now that we know Shelley has 39 paintings, we can substitute this value into equation (2) to find the number of paintings Kim has:

39 = K + 8

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us:

K = 39 - 8
K = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

The final answer is: 31"
"To determine the price of the toy after the discounts, we can apply the concept of percentage changes. 

First, we calculate the price increase in December: 
Price increase = 80% of $40 = 0.8 * $40 = $32
New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

Next, we calculate the price decrease in January:
Price decrease = 50% of $72 = 0.5 * $72 = $36
New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

Therefore, the final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"To determine the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the revenue generated from both the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the standard rate lessons. Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour, so the total revenue from these lessons is given by the product of the number of lessons and the hourly rate:

$$
\text{Revenue from standard rate lessons} = 4 \times 80 = 320
$$

Next, we need to calculate the revenue from the reduced rate lessons. Since Charlie reduces his rate by 25%, the reduced rate is 75% of the standard rate, which is $80 \times 0.75 = $60 per hour. Charlie has 2 lessons at this reduced rate, so the total revenue from these lessons is:

$$
\text{Revenue from reduced rate lessons} = 2 \times 60 = 120
$$

Now, we can find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day by adding the revenue from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons:

$$
\text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from standard rate lessons} + \text{Revenue from reduced rate lessons} = 320 + 120 = 440
$$

The final answer is: $440"
"To calculate the mean score, we need to compute the arithmetic mean of the given set of scores. The arithmetic mean is defined as the sum of all values divided by the number of values.

Given the scores: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60, we can calculate the sum of these scores as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Sum} &= 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \\
&= 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \\
&= 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \\
&= 50 + (80 + 80) + (60 + 40) + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \\
&= 50 + 160 + 100 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \\
&= 50 + 160 + 100 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \\
&= 50 + 160 + 250 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \\
&= 50 + 160 + 250 + 90 + 170 + 60 \\
&= 50 + 160 + 250 + 260 + 60 \\
&= 50 + 160 + 510 + 60 \\
&= 50 + 670 + 60 \\
&= 50 + 730 \\

\end{aligned}$$

There are 9 scores in total. To find the mean, we divide the sum by the number of scores:

$$\text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum}}{\text{Number of scores}} = \frac{780}{9}$$

$$\text{Mean} = 86.\overline{6}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{86.67}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of pomelos Eve gave away as x. Since Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up the following equation:

20 - x = (1/4) * 20

To solve for x, we can first simplify the right-hand side of the equation:

20 - x = 5

Next, we can isolate x by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

-x = -15

Multiplying both sides by -1 to solve for x:

x = 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps.

First, we need to find the number of apples Walter ate. This can be calculated as 2/5 of the total number of apples, which is 60.

$$\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24$$

So, Walter ate 24 apples.

Next, we need to find the number of apples remaining. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of apples eaten from the total number of apples.

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we need to find the number of apples Walter gave to his sister. This is 25% of the remaining 36 apples.

$$\frac{25}{100} \times 36 = 0.25 \times 36 = 9$$

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples.

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of apples given to his sister from the remaining apples.

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The amount of money he received can be calculated by multiplying the number of apples sold by the price per apple.

$$27 \times 3 = 81$$

Therefore, Walter received $81.

The final answer is: $81"
"To determine the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we can use a simple proportion. If 9 novels represent 3 quarters of the total, we can set up the following equation:

Let x be the total number of novels written this year. Then, we have:

9 = (3/4)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

x = 9 * (4/3)

x = 12

Therefore, Regina wrote 12 novels this year.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we first need to calculate the total distance he traveled in 3 days. Given that his average speed is 50 km/hr, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed × Time

Since there are 24 hours in a day, Michael traveled for 3 days, which is equivalent to 72 hours. Therefore, the total distance covered is:

Distance = 50 km/hr × 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the distance covered by dividing the distance traveled by the total distance between Alaska and Texas, which is 6000 km, and then multiplying by 100:

Percentage covered = (Distance traveled / Total distance) × 100
= (3600 km / 6000 km) × 100
= 0.6 × 100
= 60%

Therefore, Michael covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we can use a straightforward approach by tracking the number of grapes used at each stage.

Let's denote the initial number of grapes as $x$. Madeline ate 6 grapes, leaving $x - 6$ grapes. Her brother then used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, which is $5 \times 6 = 30$ grapes. Therefore, the number of grapes remaining after her brother's use is $x - 6 - 30 = x - 36$.

The mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. This means she used $4 \times 12 = 48$ grapes. Therefore, the initial number of grapes can be represented as:

$$x - 36 = 48$$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$$x = 48 + 36$$

$$x = 84$$

Therefore, the initial number of grapes was 84.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School on the day in question, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we need to calculate the number of teachers who were not absent due to illness. This can be obtained by subtracting the number of teachers who were sick from the total number of teachers at the school.

Number of teachers not sick = Total number of teachers - Number of teachers sick
= 82 - 13
= 69

Next, we need to account for the substitute teachers who were called in to help. By adding the number of substitute teachers to the number of teachers who were not sick, we can obtain the total number of teachers at the school that day.

Total number of teachers at school = Number of teachers not sick + Number of substitute teachers
= 69 + 9
= 78

Therefore, the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School on the day in question is 78.

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in a year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. 
The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00.
The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total weekly cost of the macaroni and cheese is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To determine the percentage of the custodian's day spent cleaning classrooms, we first need to calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Given that it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time can be calculated as follows:

Total time = Number of classrooms * Time per classroom
Total time = 80 * 15 minutes
Total time = 1200 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60:
Total time (hours) = 1200 / 60
Total time (hours) = 20 hours

Next, we need to determine the total available time for cleaning, which is 5 days * 8 hours per day:
Total available time = 5 * 8 hours
Total available time = 40 hours

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms by dividing the total time spent cleaning by the total available time and multiplying by 100:
Percentage of day spent cleaning = (Total time / Total available time) * 100
Percentage of day spent cleaning = (20 / 40) * 100
Percentage of day spent cleaning = 50%

Therefore, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we must first calculate the capacity of each shelf. Given that the middle shelves can hold 10 books each, the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and the top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, we can calculate the capacity of each shelf as follows:

Let's denote the capacity of a middle shelf as $m$, the capacity of the bottom shelf as $b$, and the capacity of the top shelf as $t$. We are given that $m = 10$, $b = 2m = 20$, and $t = b - 5 = 20 - 5 = 15$.

The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all its shelves: $m + m + b + t = 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55$ books.

Now, to find the number of bookcases needed to hold 110 books, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: $\frac{110}{55} = 2$.

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost of the eggs and the total revenue generated from their sale.

The cost of five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen can be calculated as follows:

Total Cost = Number of Dozens × Cost per Dozen
Total Cost = 5 × $2.40
Total Cost = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the total number of eggs purchased is:

Total Eggs = Number of Dozens × Eggs per Dozen
Total Eggs = 5 × 12
Total Eggs = 60

Rose sells the eggs in sets of 3, and each set is sold for $1. To find the total revenue, we need to determine the number of sets of 3 eggs she can sell:

Number of Sets = Total Eggs ÷ Eggs per Set
Number of Sets = 60 ÷ 3
Number of Sets = 20

Now, we can calculate the total revenue:

Total Revenue = Number of Sets × Price per Set
Total Revenue = 20 × $1
Total Revenue = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

Therefore, Rose's profit is $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the number of white hats, we can break down the problem into manageable steps. 

First, we calculate the number of red hats, which is half of the total number of hats. This can be expressed as:

Red hats = (1/2) * 100 = 50

Next, we find the number of remaining hats, which is the total number of hats minus the number of red hats:

Remaining hats = 100 - 50 = 50

Now, we calculate the number of blue hats, which is 3/5 of the remaining hats:

Blue hats = (3/5) * 50 = 30

Finally, we determine the number of white hats by subtracting the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:

White hats = 50 - 30 = 20

Therefore, the number of white hats is 20."
"To determine the cost of each stick of beef jerky, we need to calculate the discounted price of the bag and then divide it by the number of sticks.

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it is discounted by $3.00. Therefore, the discounted price is:

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

To convert the discounted price to cents, we multiply by 100:

$15.00 × 100 = 1500 cents

Now, we can find the cost of each stick of jerky by dividing the total cost in cents by the number of sticks per bag:

Cost per stick = Total cost in cents / Number of sticks per bag
= 1500 cents / 30
= 50 cents

Therefore, the cost of each stick of beef jerky is 50 cents.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, let's calculate the total number of questions she needs to get right to pass the 6th grade. Since she must correctly answer 70% of the total questions, and the total number of questions is 70 (first test) + 40 (second test) = 110, we can express this as:

Total questions needed to be correct = 0.7 * 110
Total questions needed to be correct = 77

Next, we need to find out how many questions she got right on the first test. Given that she got 60% of the 70 questions correct, we can express this as:

Questions correct on the first test = 0.6 * 70
Questions correct on the first test = 42

Now, we can find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test by subtracting the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right:

Questions needed to be correct on the second test = Total questions needed to be correct - Questions correct on the first test
Questions needed to be correct on the second test = 77 - 42
Questions needed to be correct on the second test = 35

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B.

We are given that B = 5S - 4 and S + B = 116.

We can substitute the expression for B into the second equation, yielding S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combining like terms, we get 6S - 4 = 116.

Adding 4 to both sides, we obtain 6S = 120.

Dividing both sides by 6, we find S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

The final answer is: $\boxed{96}$"
"To determine the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Given that she plays 40 games every year and scores 21 points per game, we can calculate the total points scored annually and then multiply this value by the number of years.

Let's denote the number of games per year as $g$, the score per game as $s$, and the number of years as $y$. We are given that $g = 40$ and $s = 21$. The total points scored per year can be calculated as the product of the number of games and the score per game, i.e., $g \cdot s$.

Total points per year = $g \cdot s = 40 \cdot 21 = 840$ points/year

To find the total points scored over four years, we multiply the annual points by the number of years, $y = 4$.

Total points in 4 years = $840 \cdot 4 = 3360$ points

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To determine the number of marbles Brendan ended up with, we can break down the sequence of events:

1. Initially, Brendan had 10 marbles.
2. Upon tripping, he dropped half of them, resulting in a loss of 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. Therefore, he was left with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles.
3. Subsequently, he found 3 additional marbles, bringing the total to 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. However, upon closer inspection, one of the marbles was found to be a bead, necessitating its removal. Consequently, the number of marbles was reduced to 8 - 1 = 7.

Therefore, the number of marbles Brendan ended up with is 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus, we can apply a series of ratios based on historical averages.

First, we need to establish the conversion rate from customers to sales. Given that for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, we can express this as a ratio of 1:2. To sell 15 cars, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the car dealership.

Next, we need to determine the conversion rate from telephone calls to customers. Since for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes into the car dealership, we can express this as a ratio of 1:25. To get 30 customers, Jason needs 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, based on these average numbers, Jason would need to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: 750"
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using when the lights go out, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's consider the flashlights. Since there are 4 people in the household, and each person has a flashlight, the total number of flashlights is simply 4.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house, and we are given that half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, while the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

To find the number of small candles, we can calculate half of the total number of rooms and multiply it by the number of small candles per room: $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 4 = 16$ small candles.

Similarly, to find the number of medium candles, we can calculate half of the total number of rooms and multiply it by the number of medium candles per room: $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 5 = 20$ medium candles.

Now, we can find the total number of candles by adding the number of small and medium candles: $16 + 20 = 36$ candles.

Finally, we can find the total number of candles and flashlights by adding the total number of flashlights and candles together: $4 + 36 = 40$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of chips each family member receives, we first need to calculate the total number of chips available. Given that Mitchell purchases two bags of chips, each containing 55 chips, the total number of chips can be calculated as follows:

Total number of chips = 2 bags * 55 chips/bag = 110 chips

Since there are 5 family members, we can find the number of chips each person receives by dividing the total number of chips by the number of family members:

Number of chips per person = Total number of chips / Number of family members
= 110 chips / 5
= 22 chips

Therefore, each family member will receive 22 chips.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we can calculate the time for each side and then sum these values. 

Let's denote the time it takes to solve the first side as $t_1 = 5$ minutes. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so their times are $t_2 = t_3 = 2t_1 = 2(5) = 10$ minutes. The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so their times are $t_4 = t_5 = \frac{1}{2}t_1 = \frac{1}{2}(5) = 2.5$ minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total time by summing the times for all sides: $t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + t_4 + t_5 = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30$ minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a relationship between the number of robots, helmets, and footballs. Let's denote the number of footballs as F, the number of helmets as H, and the number of robots as R.

We are given that H = 20. It is also stated that the number of robots is half the number of helmets, so R = H / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10.

Furthermore, we know that the number of helmets is half the number of footballs, which can be expressed as H = F / 2. Substituting the known value of H, we get 20 = F / 2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we find F = 40.

To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to sum the number of robots, helmets, and footballs: R + H + F = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70.

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To determine the number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we need to calculate the total number of calls he handles in a day and then multiply it by the number of working days.

First, let's convert the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the time it takes to deal with a call is 15 minutes = 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we can calculate the number of calls Tim deals with in a day by dividing the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call: 6 hours / 0.25 hours per call = 24 calls per day.

To find the total number of calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by the number of working days: 24 calls per day * 5 days = 120 calls.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the time difference in drying between the old and new varnishes on 6 paintings, we first calculate the total time required for each type of varnish to dry on the paintings.

The time it takes for the old varnish to dry on one painting is 7 minutes. Therefore, the total time for 6 paintings is 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes.

The time it takes for the new varnish to dry on one painting is 12 minutes. Consequently, the total time for 6 paintings is 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes.

To find the difference in drying time between the old and new varnishes, we subtract the time for the old varnish from the time for the new varnish: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we must first categorize and calculate the water requirements for each type of plant. 

Let's denote the number of plants requiring half a cup of water as $n_1$, the number of plants requiring one cup of water as $n_2$, and the number of plants requiring a quarter of a cup of water as $n_3$. We are given that $n_1 = 4$, $n_2 = 8$, and $n_3 = 20 - n_1 - n_2 = 8$.

The total amount of water required for the plants can be calculated as follows:

$$\text{Total water} = n_1 \times \frac{1}{2} + n_2 \times 1 + n_3 \times \frac{1}{4}$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$\text{Total water} = 4 \times \frac{1}{2} + 8 \times 1 + 8 \times \frac{1}{4}$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$\text{Total water} = 2 + 8 + 2 = 12$$

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To determine the time it takes for Phineas Frog to return home, we must consider the distances and speeds involved in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Given that Phineas is 200 yards away from his home, we can divide the total distance into two equal halves, each measuring 100 yards.

The time it takes to cover a distance is given by the formula: time = distance / speed. For the terrestrial portion, Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. Therefore, the time taken to cover 100 yards on land is:

t_land = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes

For the aquatic portion, Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. Thus, the time taken to cover 100 yards in water is:

t_water = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes

To find the total time taken to return home, we sum the time taken for each portion:

t_total = t_land + t_water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is 15 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the cost of the popsicle sticks, we need to calculate the number of boxes required and then multiply it by the cost per box.

Given that Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 sticks, we can calculate the number of boxes needed as follows:

Number of popsicle sticks needed: 56
Popsicle sticks per box: 8
Number of boxes needed: 56 ÷ 8 = 7

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes needed by the cost per box:

Cost per box: $2.00

"Given that there are five phones on a phone plan, with the main phone costing twice as much as each additional phone, and the main phone costing $20, we can determine the cost of the whole phone plan by first finding the cost of each additional phone.

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x. We are given that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

$$
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{20}{2}
$$

$$
x = 10
$$

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

$$
4x = 4 \cdot 10
$$

$$
4x = 40
$$

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

$$
\text{Total cost} = 20 + 40
$$

$$
\text{Total cost} = 60
$$

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine Derrick's daily revenue, we first need to calculate the number of doughnuts he sells in a day. Since Derrick produces 10 dozen doughnuts daily, and 1 dozen is equivalent to 12, the total number of doughnuts he produces is 10 × 12 = 120.

Given that each doughnut is sold at $2, the daily revenue can be calculated as the product of the number of doughnuts sold and the price per doughnut: 120 × $2 = $240.

June has 30 days. Therefore, to find the total revenue for the month, we multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in June: $240 × 30 = $7200.

The final answer is: $7200"
"To determine the number of days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we can use the concept of division to find the quotient of the total number of photos and the number of photos she can upload per day.

Let's denote the total number of photos as $T$ and the number of photos she can upload per day as $P$. In this case, $T = 210$ and $P = 6 \times 7 = 42$.

To find the number of days, we can divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload per day: $\frac{T}{P} = \frac{210}{42}$.

Simplifying the fraction, we get $\frac{210}{42} = \frac{5 \times 42}{42} = 5$.

Therefore, Jade needs 5 days to upload all her photos.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total cost of dry-cleaning Alicia's clothes for a period of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

First, let's calculate the weekly cost of dry-cleaning:

- The cost per blouse is $5.00, and Alicia has 5 blouses, so the weekly cost for blouses is 5 \* $5.00 = $25.00.
- The cost per skirt is $6.00, and Alicia has 1 skirt, so the weekly cost for skirts is 1 \* $6.00 = $6.00.
- The cost per pair of pants is $8.00, and Alicia has 2 pairs of pants, so the weekly cost for pants is 2 \* $8.00 = $16.00.

Now, we can calculate the total weekly cost by summing the costs for blouses, skirts, and pants: $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00.

To find the total cost for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks: $47.00 \* 5 = $235.00.

Therefore, the total cost of dry-cleaning Alicia's clothes for 5 weeks is $235.00.

The final answer is: $235.00"
"To determine the time it takes for John to speak 10 pages at his increased speed, we first need to calculate his new speaking rate. Given that his original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM), and he has improved to 2.5 times his original speed, we can calculate his new speed as follows:

New speed = 2.5 * 150 WPM = 375 WPM

Next, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages, assuming each page contains 450 words. 

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

Now, we can calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words at the new speed using the formula:

Time = Total words / New speed

Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM

To solve for time, we can divide the total number of words by the new speaking speed:

Time = 4500 / 375 = 12 hours

Therefore, it would take John 12 hours to speak 10 pages at his increased speed.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we can break down the problem into manageable parts. 

Let's denote the number of people Conor saw on the first day as $P_1 = 50$. On the second day, the number of people increased by 20, so $P_2 = P_1 + 20 = 50 + 20 = 70$. On the third day, the number of people doubled from the second day, so $P_3 = 2 \cdot P_2 = 2 \cdot 70 = 140$.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is the sum of $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$, which is $P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 50 + 70 + 140 = 260$.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is $4 \cdot 60 = 240$.

Therefore, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is $260 + 240 = 500$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{500}$"
"To determine the total number of popcorn pieces Garrett has to eat, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and add them up.

Let's denote the number of kernels that popped in the first 30 seconds as $K_1$, the number of kernels that popped in the next 30 seconds as $K_2$, the number of kernels that popped in the next 30 seconds as $K_3$, and the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds as $K_4$. We are also given that a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat, denoted as $K_5$.

We are given the following information:
- $K_1 = 20$
- $K_2 = 3K_1 = 3(20) = 60$
- $K_3 = 4K_1 = 4(20) = 80$
- $K_4 = 0.5K_3 = 0.5(80) = 40$
- $K_5 = 0.25K_4 = 0.25(40) = 10$

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped:
$K_{\text{total}} = K_1 + K_2 + K_3 + K_4 + K_5 = 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210$

The final answer is: $\boxed{210}$"
"To determine the number of lemons required for the lemonade, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed. Since each gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of fresh lemon juice, and Tim plans to make 4 gallons for the party plus 1 extra gallon for Allen, we can calculate the total amount of lemon juice required as follows:

Total gallons = 4 (party gallons) + 1 (extra gallon for Allen) = 5 gallons

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, the total amount of lemon juice needed is:

Total cups of juice = 5 gallons × 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups

Now, we need to find out how many lemons are required for the extra tart lemonade. This lemonade is twice as tart as the other gallons, which means it requires twice the amount of lemon juice. Therefore, the amount of lemon juice required for the extra tart lemonade is:

Extra tart lemonade cups = 1 gallon × 2 = 2 cups

The number of lemons required for the extra tart lemonade can be calculated as follows:

Extra tart lemons = 2 cups / (1 cup / 6 lemons) = 2 × 6 = 12 lemons

However, this is the number of lemons required for the extra tart lemonade alone. We also need to consider the number of lemons required for the regular lemonade. The number of lemons required for the regular lemonade is:

Regular lemons = 5 cups / (1 cup / 6 lemons) = 5 × 6 = 30 lemons

Therefore, the total number of lemons required is the sum of the lemons required for the extra tart lemonade and the regular lemonade:

Total lemons = Extra tart lemons + Regular lemons = 12 + 30 = 42 lemons

"To determine the total amount of dog food required for the kennel, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both German Shepherds and Bulldogs, and then multiply it by 7 to obtain the weekly consumption.

The daily consumption of dog food can be calculated as follows:

- German Shepherds: 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg/day
- Bulldogs: 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg/day

The total daily consumption is the sum of the individual consumptions: 15 kg/day + 6 kg/day = 21 kg/day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg.

Therefore, the kennel will require 147 kg of dog food per week.

The final answer is: 147"
"To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we can calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged and 4-legged animals separately and then find the total number of pairs.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals. Since each animal has 2 legs, we can multiply the number of 2-legged animals by 2.

Total legs from 2-legged animals = 10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs

Next, we'll calculate the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals. Since each animal has 4 legs, we can multiply the number of 4-legged animals by 4.

Total legs from 4-legged animals = 15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

Now, we can find the total number of legs on the farm by adding the total number of legs from the 2-legged and 4-legged animals.

Total legs = 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since the question asks for the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2.

Total pairs of legs = 80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of red blocks in the tower, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of red blocks as 'r'. We know that the tower consists of 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, which equals 8 yellow blocks. Therefore, the total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Given that the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, we can set up the equation:

4 (blue blocks) + 8 (yellow blocks) + r (red blocks) = 32

Simplifying the equation, we get:

12 + r = 32

Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation yields:

r = 32 - 12
r = 20

Therefore, the number of red blocks in the tower is 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the distance Elvis is from his house, we need to consider the total displacement, which is the net distance traveled in a specific direction. 

Let's break down the problem: Elvis travels 5 hours west at a speed of 18 mph, resulting in a displacement of 5 * 18 = 90 miles west. Then, he travels 8 hours east at the same speed, resulting in a displacement of 8 * 18 = 144 miles east.

The total displacement is the difference between the eastward and westward displacements, which is 144 - 90 = 54 miles. This means Elvis is 54 miles east of his original position.

Therefore, the distance Elvis is from his house now is 54 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the value of the boat after three years, we can apply the concept of depreciation, which is a reduction in the value of an asset over time. In this case, the boat depreciates by a certain percentage each year.

The initial value of the boat is $9000. 

In the first year, the boat depreciates by 30%, which can be calculated as follows:

Depreciation in the first year = 0.3 \* $9000 = $2700
Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

In the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30% of its value after the first year:

Depreciation in the second year = 0.3 \* $6300 = $1890
Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20% of its value after the second year:

Depreciation in the third year = 0.2 \* $4410 = $882
Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

Therefore, the value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To determine the number of pink candies in the bag, we can utilize a systematic approach by first identifying the quantities of the other colored candies. 

Given that the bag contains 232 pieces of individually wrapped candies, we know that 54 of them are red. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, which can be expressed as 2 * 54 = 108. 

Furthermore, the number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, which can be calculated as 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we can calculate the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies by summing their quantities: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies in the bag: 232 - 189 = 43.

Therefore, the number of pink candies in the bag is 43.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43}$"
"To determine the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the bus trips separately and then sum them.

The cost of the hotel can be calculated by multiplying the cost of one night by the number of nights. Given that the cost of one night at the hotel is $80, we can express this as:

Cost of hotel = Cost of one night × Number of nights
= $80 × 3
= $240

The cost of the bus trips can be determined by finding the cost of one bus trip and then multiplying it by the number of trips. Since the cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, we can express this as:

Cost of one bus trip = 10% of $80
= 0.1 × $80
= $8

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the bus trips by multiplying the cost of one bus trip by the number of trips:

Total cost of bus trips = Cost of one bus trip × Number of trips
= $8 × 7
= $56

To find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels, we add the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips:

Total cost = Cost of hotel + Total cost of bus trips
= $240 + $56
= $296

The final answer is: $296"
"To determine the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we can start by calculating the total number of marbles Dallas received. Since Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, we can infer that he initially had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.

Given that Mazie distributed a total of 52 marbles to the twins, we can calculate the number of marbles Darla received by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles distributed.

Let's denote the number of marbles Darla received as D. We can express this as an equation:

D = 52 - 25

D = 27

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla."
"To determine the total cost of the family's outing to the cinema, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately and then add them together.

First, let's consider the cost of the tickets. The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and there are two adults, so the total cost of the adult tickets is 2 * $12 = $24. The cost of a child ticket is $8, and there is one child, so the total cost of the child ticket is $8.

Next, let's consider the cost of the popcorns. The cost of each popcorn is $3, and the family purchases two popcorns, so the total cost of the popcorns is 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $24 + $8 + $6 = $38.

Therefore, the total cost of the family's outing to the cinema is $38.

The final answer is: $38"
"To determine the force required to move the car, we need to calculate the total weight of the vehicle, its contents, and occupants. The weight of the car itself is 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and the two children weigh 75 pounds each.

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of its total weight, we can calculate this as a percentage of the total weight.

Force = 1% * 1600
Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

Therefore, the force required to move the car is 16 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

"To determine the total number of good seashells, we need to calculate the total number of seashells found and then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

Let's denote the total number of seashells found as S, the number of seashells found by Tom as T, the number of seashells found by Nancy as N, and the number of seashells found by Benny as B. We also denote the number of cracked seashells as C.

Given values:
- T = 214
- N = 432
- B = 86
- C = 67

We can calculate the total number of seashells found as the sum of the individual counts:
S = T + N + B
S = 214 + 432 + 86
S = 732

Now, to find the total number of good seashells, we subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells:
Good seashells = S - C
Good seashells = 732 - 67
Good seashells = 665

Therefore, the total number of good seashells found is 665."
"To determine the total cost of the place settings for Avery's holiday dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of the dinner plates. The cost of a single dinner plate is $6.00, and Avery needs 12 plates. Therefore, the total cost of the dinner plates is given by the product of the cost per plate and the number of plates: $6.00 \* 12 = $72.

Next, we calculate the cost of the bowls. Each bowl costs $5.00, and Avery also needs 12 bowls. The total cost of the bowls is then $5.00 \* 12 = $60.

Lastly, we determine the cost of the salad plates. Each salad plate costs $4.00, and Avery requires 12 salad plates. The total cost of the salad plates is $4.00 \* 12 = $48.

To find the total cost of the place settings, we sum the costs of the dinner plates, bowls, and salad plates: $72 + $60 + $48 = $180.

"To determine the amount of feed left after a week, we need to calculate the total feed consumption of the pigs over this period. Each pig consumes 4 pounds of feed twice a day, which translates to a daily consumption of 8 pounds per pig.

Given that Dexter has 5 pigs, the total daily feed consumption is 5 pigs * 8 pounds/pig = 40 pounds/day.

Over a 7-day period, the total feed consumption is 40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds.

Since Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, the amount left after a week can be calculated as follows:

300 pounds (initial feed) - 280 pounds (feed consumed) = 20 pounds

Therefore, the amount of feed left after a week is 20 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount John needs to spend on hot dogs, we must first calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. Given that each guest will consume 2 hot dogs, and there are 20 guests, the total number of hot dogs required is:

$$\text{Total hot dogs required} = 20 \times 2 = 40$$

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so we subtract those from the total required:

$$\text{Total hot dogs required} = 40 - 4 = 36$$

Since each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we can determine the number of packs needed by dividing the total hot dogs required by the number of hot dogs per pack:

$$\text{Number of packs needed} = \frac{36}{6} = 6$$

Given that each pack costs $2, the total amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is:

$$\text{Total cost} = 6 \times 2 = 12$$

"To determine the total age of the siblings, we can start by identifying the age of the older brother. Since one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Let x be the age of the older brother. Then, 12 = x/2.

Solving for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 12 * 2
x = 24

Therefore, the older brother is 24 years old.

Next, we can calculate the total age of the 3 sisters, who are all 16 years old:

Total age of sisters = 3 * 16
Total age of sisters = 48

Now, we can find the total age of the 2 brothers by adding the ages of the 2 brothers:

Total age of brothers = 12 + 24
Total age of brothers = 36

Finally, we can find the total age of all the siblings by adding the total age of the brothers and the total age of the sisters:

Total age of all siblings = Total age of brothers + Total age of sisters
Total age of all siblings = 36 + 48
Total age of all siblings = 84

"To determine the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation. Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, which totals 30 minutes per day. Since she meditates 7 days a week, the total meditation time per week is given by the formula:

Meditation time per week = 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week

Next, we calculate the time spent on yoga. Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) per day, 5 days a week. The total yoga time per week is:

Yoga time per week = 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week

Now, we can find the total time spent on meditation and yoga per week by adding the two values:

Total time per week = Meditation time per week + Yoga time per week
= 210 minutes/week + 300 minutes/week
= 510 minutes/week

To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks, we multiply the total time per week by 4:

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. This gives us a total of 18 cookies.

We can represent this as an initial cookie count: C = 9 (oatmeal) + 4 (chocolate chip) + 5 (sugar) = 18 cookies.

Randy then consumes 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This reduces his cookie count by 3. We can represent this as: C = 18 - 3 = 15 cookies.

Next, Randy eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, further reducing his cookie count. We can update the count as: C = 15 - 2 = 13 cookies.

Randy then gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, which reduces his cookie count by 2. We can update the count as: C = 13 - 2 = 11 cookies.

Finally, Randy bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner, adding 12 cookies to his collection. We can update the count as: C = 11 + 12 = 23 cookies.

Therefore, Randy now has 23 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the total amount Matthew would earn from selling his collection of 12 unique toy soldiers, we can divide the collection into two equal halves and calculate the revenue from each half separately.

Let's denote the number of toy soldiers in each half as $n$. Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can express this as $n = 12/2 = 6$. 

For the first half, Matthew would receive $5 per toy, so the revenue from the first half is $5n = 5(6) = 30$ dollars.

For the second half, Matthew would receive $7 per toy, so the revenue from the second half is $7n = 7(6) = 42$ dollars.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the revenue from both halves: $30 + 42 = 72$ dollars.

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's vacation and the number of days it takes Nate to fill in the holes.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's vacation. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the total number of holes.

Let's denote the number of holes dug per day as $d = 6$ and the number of days Nate was on vacation as $n = 14$. The total number of holes dug is given by:

$$\text{Total Holes} = d \cdot n = 6 \cdot 14 = 84$$

However, since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, we need to add these to the total holes dug during the day. Since Nate fills the holes for the same number of days he was on vacation, we can add the holes dug at night to the total holes:

$$\text{Total Holes} = 84 + (6 \cdot 14) = 84 + 84 = 168$$

Now, let's calculate the number of days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. We can use the formula for the number of days to fill the holes:

$$\text{Days to Fill Holes} = \frac{\text{Total Holes}}{\text{Net Holes Filled per Day}}$$

Since Nate fills 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net number of holes filled per day is:

$$\text{Net Holes Filled per Day} = 9 - 6 = 3$$

Now, we can plug in the values to find the number of days to fill the holes:

$$\text{Days to Fill Holes} = \frac{168}{3} = 56$$

Finally, we need to find the number of weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. We can do this by dividing the number of days to fill the holes by 7:

$$\text{Weeks to Fill Holes} = \frac{56}{7} = 8$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we can utilize a straightforward calculation based on the given information.

Let's denote the average enrollment at Norman High School as N and the average enrollment at Butler High School as B. We are given that B = (3/4)N.

Given that N = 4000, we can substitute this value into the equation for B:

B = (3/4)N
B = (3/4)(4000)
B = 3000

Now, we can calculate the difference in enrollment between the two schools by subtracting B from N:

Difference in enrollment = N - B
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 more than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate chip cookies made by the Adams family, we can utilize a simple arithmetic operation. Given that they have produced a total of 7995 cookies, with 2595 being rainbow cookies and 3075 being oatmeal cookies, we can calculate the number of chocolate chip cookies by subtracting the sum of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total.

Let's denote the number of chocolate chip cookies as $C$. We can express this relationship as:

$C = 7995 - (2595 + 3075)$

To solve for $C$, we first evaluate the expression within the parentheses:

$C = 7995 - 5670$

Now, we perform the subtraction:

$C = 2325$

Therefore, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2325}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes as $t$, $b$, and $p$, respectively.

We are given the following information:

1. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: $t = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 16 = 8$.
2. Igor gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested: $t = p + 2$. However, we already know that $t = 8$, so we can rewrite this equation as $8 = p + 2$, which implies $p = 6$.
3. Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers: $b = 7$.
4. The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29: $t + b + p = 29$.

Substituting the values of $t$ and $p$ into the last equation, we get:

$8 + 7 + 6 = 29$

This equation is true, so we can verify that our values are consistent.

However, we are asked to find the number of beakers Igor lost. We know that Igor had 7 beakers initially, but we need to find out how many he had on the lab bench. Since the total number of items on the lab bench is 29, and we know that $t = 8$ and $p = 6$, we can find the number of beakers on the lab bench by subtracting the number of test tubes and Petri dishes from the total:

$b_{\text{lab bench}} = 29 - 8 - 6 = 15$

Since Igor had 7 beakers initially, the number of beakers he lost is:

$7 - 15 = -8$

However, since we cannot have a negative number of beakers lost, this means that Igor must have lost 8 beakers to have 15 on the lab bench."
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws, so the total number of screws needed for each table is 4 legs/table * 2 screws/leg = 8 screws/table.

Since James is assembling 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 screws/table * 4 tables = 32 screws.

Now, we can calculate the number of screws James will have left over by subtracting the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs in both baskets, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. Let's denote the number of eggs in the first basket as x. Given that there are twice as many eggs in the second basket, the number of eggs in the second basket is 2x.

We are given that the first basket contains 10 eggs. Therefore, we can equate x to 10, which implies that the second basket contains 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we can add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket: x + 2x = 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total amount of money raised by the girls, we can start by identifying the individual contributions. Let's denote Alexandra's contribution as A, Kim's contribution as K, Maryam's contribution as M, and Sarah's contribution as S.

We are given that Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so we can express this as K = A + $320.

We are also given that Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so we can express this as M = S + $400.

Furthermore, we know that Alexandra raises $430, and Sarah raises $300. Therefore, we can substitute these values into the equations:

K = A + $320
K = $430 + $320
K = $750

M = S + $400
M = $300 + $400
M = $700

Now that we have the individual contributions, we can calculate the total amount raised by adding the contributions of all four girls:

Total = K + A + M + S
Total = $750 + $430 + $700 + $300
Total = $2180

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's analyze the given information:

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Given that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can establish a speed ratio between the two runners. If we let Vanessa's speed be represented by V, then Aaron's speed is 2V. 

Since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, we can express the distance covered by each runner in terms of a common variable. Let's denote the distance covered by Aaron as D. Then, the distance covered by Vanessa is 2D. We are given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, so we can equate 2D to 4 miles:

2D = 4
D = 2

This implies that Aaron ran 2 miles. Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can calculate his speed:

Speed = Distance / Time
Aaron's speed = 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute

Since Aaron's speed is 2V, we can equate 2V to 1/8 miles per minute:

2V = 1/8
V = 1/16 miles per minute

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can calculate the time it took her to complete her part of the race:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: 64"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs to purchase, we must first calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Given that he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we can use the formula:

Total line required = dock length * line per foot
Total line required = 200 feet * 3 feet/foot
Total line required = 600 feet

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. To find the amount he needs to buy, we subtract the existing line from the total required:

Line to buy = Total line required - existing line
Line to buy = 600 feet - 6 feet
Line to buy = 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To determine the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue. Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, and each reservation consists of 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. Therefore, the daily revenue can be calculated as follows:

Daily revenue = (2 meals * $5) + $5 (bottle of wine)
             = (2 * $5) + $5
             = $10 + $5
             = $15

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the weekly revenue can be calculated as follows:

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * Number of days open
             = $15 * 2
             = $30

Therefore, Tom's restaurant makes $30 per week.

The final answer is: $30"
"To determine the selling price of each watermelon, we can use the concept of percentage increase. The vendor sold the watermelons at a 25% profit, which means the selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit).

Let's denote the cost price of one watermelon as x. The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80, so we can write the equation:

50x = 80

To find the cost price of one watermelon, we divide both sides of the equation by 50:

x = 80 / 50
x = $1.60

Now, we can find the selling price of one watermelon by multiplying the cost price by 1.25 (125%):

Selling price = 1.25x
Selling price = 1.25($1.60)
Selling price = $2

Therefore, the selling price of each watermelon is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the current age of James, John's son. We are given that James is twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This implies that Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, his current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

However, we are also given that John had James when he was 19. This information is inconsistent with the fact that James is currently 18 years old, as it would imply that John had James after he was 19. This inconsistency suggests that the initial information provided is flawed.

Assuming the information is incomplete or incorrect, we can proceed with the problem by focusing on the information about John's youngest son. We are told that John was 32 when his youngest son was born. Therefore, his youngest son's current age is 32.

To find his age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 32 + 3 = 35.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after an hour, we can calculate their respective rates of peeling and then find the difference.

Let's denote the number of oranges Ana peels in an hour as A and the number of oranges Jane peels in an hour as J. Given that Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange, her rate of peeling is 1/3 oranges per minute. Similarly, Jane's rate of peeling is 1/4 oranges per minute.

The number of oranges Ana peels in an hour (A) can be calculated as follows:

A = (1/3 oranges/minute) * (60 minutes) = 20 oranges

The number of oranges Jane peels in an hour (J) can be calculated as follows:

J = (1/4 oranges/minute) * (60 minutes) = 15 oranges

Now, we can find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:

Δ = A - J = 20 - 15 = 5 oranges

Therefore, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total cost of the radiator replacement, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the labor cost of the mechanic.

First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the 80% discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400. The discount amount is 80% of $400, which can be calculated as:

400 - (400 * 0.8) = 400 - 320 = $80

This represents the cost of the radiator after the discount.

Next, we need to calculate the labor cost of the mechanic. The mechanic works for 3 hours at a rate of $50 per hour. The labor cost can be calculated as:

3 * 50 = $150

Now, we can determine the total cost by adding the cost of the radiator and the labor cost:

Total cost = Cost of radiator + Labor cost
= $80 + $150
= $230

Therefore, Mark paid a total of $230 for the radiator replacement.

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve the first equation for W:

W = 20 - C

Substituting this expression for W into the second equation, we get:

2C + 4(20 - C) = 70

Expanding the equation, we get:

2C + 80 - 4C = 70

Combine like terms:

-2C + 80 = 70

Subtract 80 from both sides:

-2C = -10

Divide both sides by -2:

C = 5

Therefore, the number of chickens on the farm is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we calculate the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is given by the product of the number of pizzas and the number of slices per pizza: $7 \times 8 = 56$.

There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends). To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: $\frac{56}{4} = 14$.

Therefore, each person can have $\boxed{14}$ slices."
