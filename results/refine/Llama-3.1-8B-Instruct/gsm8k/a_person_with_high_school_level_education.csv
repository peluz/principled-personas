"Let's break down Janet's daily egg sales. She lays 16 eggs per day. For breakfast, she eats 3 eggs, and she bakes 4 eggs for muffins. To find out how many eggs she has left, we need to subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid.

16 (total eggs laid) - 7 (eggs used for breakfast and baking) = 9 eggs left

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs left by the price per egg.

9 eggs * $2/egg = $18

So, Janet makes $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to figure out how much white fiber is required. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's find the new value of the house: 
New value = Original value + (Original value * 150%)
New value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

Now, we need to find the total cost of the house, which is the original price plus the repairs:
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

The profit is the difference between the new value and the total cost:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

James runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters he runs in one session is:

3 sprints × 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:

180 meters/session × 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to calculate the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon, and then subtract that from the total number of cups of feed needed per meal.

First, let's find the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon. We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. 

Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups
Total feed given in the morning and afternoon: 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: 
60 - 40 = 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
Since the cost of each glass decreases by 40% each time, we can find the cost of the remaining glasses by multiplying the cost of the previous glass by 0.6.

The cost of the first glass is $5, the second is $3, the third is $3 * 0.6 = $1.8, the fourth is $1.8 * 0.6 = $1.08, the fifth is $1.08 * 0.6 = $0.648, the sixth is $0.648 * 0.6 = $0.3888, the seventh is $0.3888 * 0.6 = $0.23328, the eighth is $0.23328 * 0.6 = $0.139968, the ninth is $0.139968 * 0.6 = $0.0839856, the tenth is $0.0839856 * 0.6 = $0.05039136, the eleventh is $0.05039136 * 0.6 = $0.030234816, the twelfth is $0.030234816 * 0.6 = $0.0181407896, the thirteenth is $0.0181407896 * 0.6 = $0.01088447476, the fourteenth is $0.01088447476 * 0.6 = $0.006530684856, the fifteenth is $0.006530684856 * 0.6 = $0.0039184109136, the sixteenth is $0.0039184109136 * 0.6 = $0.0023610469456.

Now, we add up the costs of all 16 glasses: 
$5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.648 + $0.3888 + $0.23328 + $0.139968 + $0.0839856 + $0.05039136 + $0.030234816 + $0.0181407896 + $0.01088447476 + $0.006530684856 + $0.0039184109136 + $0.0023610469456 = $23.016

The total cost is $23.016."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Seattle has 20 sheep. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston by multiplying 20 by 4.

Charleston's sheep = 4 * 20 = 80

Now, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we multiply the number of sheep in Charleston by 2 to find the number of sheep in Toulouse.

Toulouse's sheep = 2 * 80 = 160

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle.

Total sheep = Toulouse's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Seattle's sheep
Total sheep = 160 + 80 + 20
Total sheep = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into parts. First, let's find the time it takes to download 40% of the file. 

40% of 200 GB is 0.4 x 200 GB = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Now, let's find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. 60% of 200 GB is 0.6 x 200 GB = 120 GB. The time it takes to download 120 GB is 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

However, we also need to add the time it takes to install the updates, which is 20 minutes. So, the total time is 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in each segment of his trip and then subtract the total distance from the initial distance.

First, let's find the distance John traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Now, let's find the distance John traveled in the first 2 hours of the return trip in standstill traffic. Since he is not moving, the distance is 0 miles.

Next, let's find the distance John traveled in the next half-hour at 30 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

Finally, let's find the distance John traveled in the remaining 2 hours of the return trip at 80 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

Total distance traveled in the return trip = 15 + 160 = 175 miles

Now, let's find the total distance John traveled in the 4 hours:

Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the return trip = 175 miles

Total distance traveled in 4 hours = 180 + 175 = 355 miles

Since John is now back home, the distance he is from home is 0 miles.

However, if we are looking for the distance from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to consider the distance he has traveled in the 4 hours. 

Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the return trip = 175 miles

Total distance traveled in 4 hours = 180 + 175 = 355 miles

Since John is now back home, the distance he is from home is 0 miles.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours.

First, let's find her earnings for the first 40 hours. We multiply the number of hours she worked (40) by her hourly rate ($10). 

40 * $10 = $400

Next, we need to find her earnings for the overtime hours. She worked a total of 45 hours, so the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour. So, her earnings for the overtime hours are 5 * $12 = $60.

Now, we add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours to find her total earnings for the week.

$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost of the pastries, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the donuts. Since there are 3 dozen donuts and each dozen costs $68, we multiply 3 by $68 to get the total cost of the donuts: 3 × $68 = $204.

Next, we find the cost of the mini cupcakes. There are 2 dozen cupcakes and each dozen costs $80, so we multiply 2 by $80 to get the total cost of the cupcakes: 2 × $80 = $160.

Finally, we find the cost of the mini cheesecakes. There are 6 dozen cheesecakes and each dozen costs $55, so we multiply 6 by $55 to get the total cost of the cheesecakes: 6 × $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total revenue it generates each year.

The total cost of the tree is $90 (initial cost).

The revenue generated each year is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50 per year.

The cost to maintain the tree each year is $3.

So, the net revenue each year is $10.50 - $3 = $7.50 per year.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to pay for itself, we need to divide the initial cost by the net revenue:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.50 (net revenue) = 12 years

Since the tree will start generating revenue in the first year, it will start earning money in the 1st year.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman who sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we need to find out how many she started with.

Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with ""x"". 

First, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners. So, she had (x - x/3) = (2x/3) vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she had (2x/3 - 2) vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of (2x/3 - 2) is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = (x/3 - 1).

So, she had (2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1)) = (x/3 - 1) vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house.

We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: x/3 = 6.

Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance is also 4. So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the best purchase option, we need to calculate the increase in value for each item. 

The increase in value of the jewelry is 2.5% of $5,000, which is 0.025 * $5,000 = $125.

The increase in value of the electronic gadgets is 1.2% of $8,000, which is 0.012 * $8,000 = $96.

Since $125 is greater than $96, the merchant should choose the jewelry.

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125.

The final answer is: $125"
"To find the distance covered by each train in the two days, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem. This theorem helps us find the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.

The distance covered by each train on the first day is 80 miles westward. On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. We can use these distances as the legs of a right-angled triangle.

Let's use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance covered by each train:

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

where a = 80 miles (westward distance)
b = 150 miles (northward distance)
c = total distance covered by each train

80^2 + 150^2 = c^2
6400 + 22500 = c^2
28900 = c^2
c = √28900
c = 170 miles

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 170 miles."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's find her earnings from teaching. We know she gets paid $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, we multiply the hours she works per week by the number of weeks she works to get the total hours she works in a year.

35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year

Now, we multiply the total hours she works in a year by her hourly wage to get her annual earnings from teaching.

1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's find her earnings from coaching. We know she gets paid $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Again, we multiply the hours she works per week by the number of weeks she works to get the total hours she works in a year.

15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year

Now, we multiply the total hours she works in a year by her hourly wage to get her annual earnings from coaching.

750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

To find her total annual salary, we add her earnings from teaching and coaching.

$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks and multiply it by the number of eggs she eats per day.

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Claire eats 3 eggs per day, so in 28 days, she will eat 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat.

84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we need to know how much time she has left to walk the remaining distance. We know she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike. 

First, let's find the total time she needs to complete the hike. We can do this by dividing the total distance by her desired average speed:

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Since she has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks separately.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so we need to find two-thirds of 10 liters.
(2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so we need to find three-fifths of 15 liters.
(3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before spilling. 
6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water.
15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters

However, we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. 
Since the total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, and we have 14.67 liters of water, the remaining amount of non-water liquid is 24 - 14.67 = 9.33 liters.

To find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to find the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink and the pineapple drink. 
Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is (1/3) * 9.33 = 3.11 liters.
Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is (2/5) * 9.33 = 3.732 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.67 + 3.11 + 3.732 = 21.512 liters.

"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers buy 1 DVD each, so they buy a total of 3 * 1 = 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so they buy a total of 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

To find the total number of DVDs sold, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"To find out how much shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns for 4 hours, from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. We know that it melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour.

To find the total melting, we multiply the rate by the time:

Total melting = rate * time
Total melting = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
Total melting = 8 cm

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to figure out the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price.

Let's say the original price is 'x'. Since the book was sold with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so it is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she bought that we know the quantity and price of. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12, the cost of the milk is 5 packs * $3 = $15, and the cost of the apples is 4 apples * $1.50 = $6. 

So, the total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Now, we need to subtract the total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples from the total amount Marie paid to find the cost of the pizza boxes. 

Cost of pizza boxes = Total amount paid - Total cost of chicken, milk, and apples
= $50 - $33
= $17

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box to find the number of boxes.

Number of pizza boxes = Cost of pizza boxes / Cost of each box
= $17 / $8.50
= 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (1 serving per night for 60 nights).

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find the total number of cartons she needs, we divide 60 by 15:
60 ÷ 15 = 4

So, Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream.

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:
4 cartons × $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles.

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Gloria has to choose between a pair of boots and two pairs of high heels. The two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much as the first pair.

Since the more expensive pair of heels costs twice as much as the less expensive pair, we can find its cost by multiplying the cost of the less expensive pair by 2. So, the more expensive pair costs 2 * 33 = $66.

Now, we know that the total cost of the two pairs of heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots. We can represent this as an equation: B = 33 + 66 - 5, where B is the cost of the boots.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

The final answer is: $94"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of ratios and algebra. Let's say Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a constant.

We know that their total age is 162, so we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 162 / 18
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 11x = 11 * 9
11x = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To find the average guess, we need to find the total number of guesses and divide by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one: $\frac{80}{2} = 40$, so the second person guesses $40 + 20 = 60$.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first one: $80 \times 0.25 = 20$, so the third person guesses $80 + 20 = 100$.

The total number of guesses is $80 + 60 + 100 = 240$.
There are 3 people.

The average guess is $\frac{240}{3} = 80$.

"To find out how many hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to calculate the total time he spends on each dog and then multiply that by the number of dogs.

First, we need to find the total time John spends on each dog in a day. Since each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business, we can just use that number.

Time per dog = 0.5 hours

Now, we multiply the time per dog by the number of dogs to get the total time spent in a day.

Total time per day = Time per dog * Number of dogs
Total time per day = 0.5 * 10
Total time per day = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total time per day by 7 to get the total time spent in a week.

Total time per week = Total time per day * 7
Total time per week = 5 * 7
Total time per week = 35 hours

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. We also know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's use the variable S to represent the number of silver coins and G to represent the number of gold coins.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: S + G = 110. We also know that G = S + 30, since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can substitute G = S + 30 into the first equation: S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2S = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels. 

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Aaron has. We're told that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. To find half of Raymond's jewels, we divide 40 by 2, which is 20. Then, we add 5 to that result to find out how many jewels Aaron has: 20 + 5 = 25.

Now that we know Aaron has 25 jewels, we can find out how many jewels Siobhan has. We're told that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we subtract 2 from 25: 25 - 2 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 4 × 0.25 = 1 point. So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first calculate how many yogurts he eats in that time. Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, we multiply the number of yogurts he eats per day by the number of days:

2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys. We can do this by dividing the total number of yogurts by 4:

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts/set = 15 sets

Since each set costs $5.00, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set to find the total amount Terry spends:

15 sets * $5.00/set = $75.00

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John has left, we need to calculate how much money he made from selling the Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money.

Let's start by finding the total amount of money John made from selling the Lego sets. Since he sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, we can multiply the number of sets by the price per set:

13 × $15 = $195

Next, we need to find out how much money John spent on the video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so we multiply the number of games by the price per game:

8 × $20 = $160

Now, we know that John had $5 left after buying the video games. This means he spent $190 in total on the video games and the remaining money. To find out how much money he spent from his own money, we subtract the remaining money from the total amount he made:

$195 - $5 = $190

Since John spent $190 on the video games, we can set up an equation to find out how many Lego sets he sold with his own money:

Let x be the number of Lego sets he sold with his own money. Then, the number of Lego sets he sold with the money from the Lego sales is 13 - x.

The total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets is $195, and he spent $190 on the video games. We can set up the equation:

15x + 15(13 - x) = 190

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15x + 195 - 15x = 190

Combine like terms:

195 = 190

This equation doesn't make sense, as it implies that John didn't sell any Lego sets with his own money. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Since John had $5 left after buying the video games, we know that he spent $190 on the video games. We can set up an equation to find out how many Lego sets he sold:

Let x be the number of Lego sets he sold. Then, the total amount of money he made is:

15x = 190 + 5

Combine the constants:

15x = 195

Divide both sides by 15:

x = 13

This means John sold all 13 Lego sets with the money from the Lego sales. However, this is not possible, as he had $5 left after buying the video games. Let's re-evaluate the problem again.

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

John runs 3 hours the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total running time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we need to multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time.
Total weekly running time = 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.
Speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour

The final answer is: 3.33"
"To solve this problem, we need to find Dana's walking speed first. We know that her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour, and it's half of her running speed. So, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find the time she spends walking and running. We know she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time she spends walking is 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours, and the time she spends running is 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours.

The distance she travels while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles, and the distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age by multiplying Suzy's age by 2.

Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
= 2 * 1
= 2 years

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. To find Brandon's iPhone age, we multiply Ben's iPhone age by 4.

Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
= 4 * 2
= 8 years

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how far Polly can throw the javelin when she's holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, she can throw it 400 feet. When she's holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther.

Let's calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone:

Distance with gemstone = 3 * 400 feet
Distance with gemstone = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1000 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin. To find the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames, we need to subtract 1000 from the distance she can throw with the gemstone.

Distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames = 1200 - 1000
Distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames = 200 feet

"To figure out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to know how many calories you can still consume. Since your daily calorie target is 2000 and you've already had 1800 calories, we subtract the calories you've had from your target: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Now, we need to find out how many servings of chips you can have with 200 calories. Each serving has 250 calories, so we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we multiply the number of servings you can still have by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

"To find Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he makes and sells 20 candles.

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Now, let's find the total cost. Charlie needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles, and each pound costs $10.00.

Total cost = Cost of supplies for 20 candles
Total cost = 2 pounds * $10.00 per pound
Total cost = $20.00

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find this, we multiply 5 by 2/5, which is the same as multiplying 5 by 0.4. So, 5 * 0.4 = 2. This means she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Total number of articles written in 3 days = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to figure out how many she bought. We know she started with 80 Post-it notes and ended up with 23 after using 220 at work. 

Let's use a simple equation to solve this problem:

Let x be the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice bought.

The total number of Post-it notes after buying the package is the sum of the initial Post-it notes, the Post-it notes in the package, and the Post-it notes remaining, minus the Post-it notes used at work.

So, the equation is: 80 + x - 220 + 23 = x

Simplifying the equation:
80 + x - 220 + 23 = x
-117 + x = x

To isolate x, we need to get rid of the x on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting x from both sides:

-117 = 0

Now, we need to get x by itself on the left side. To do this, we can add 117 to both sides of the equation:

x = 117

The final answer is: 117"

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we need to find the cost of each red tie. We know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. This means the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie, which is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

To find the total cost of the red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie: 10 * 60 = $600.

Finally, to find the total amount spent on ties, we add the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many pieces of wire Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 4 feet by 12 to get the total length in inches.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained.

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of units in the building, we multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor: 15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. To do this, we multiply the total number of units by 1/4: 120 units * 1/4 = 30 units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens are produced per week:
1764 eggs per week ÷ 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the total time Tom spent traveling, we need to calculate the time he spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM and the time he spent traveling back.

First, let's find the distance Tom traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he traveled for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can use the formula: distance = speed × time. So, distance = 10 miles per hour × 3 hours = 30 miles.

Now, we need to find the time it took to travel 30 miles back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. We can use the formula: time = distance ÷ speed. So, time = 30 miles ÷ 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.

The total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove from his book bag. We know that his comic books weigh 1/4 pound each and he removed 30 comic books. The total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so we can find the number of toys to be removed by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire. 

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. 

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 * $40 = $480

Now, we need to compare the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday to find the day with higher revenue. 

Thursday's revenue: $520
Friday's revenue: $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 

To find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue.

Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

The final answer is: $40"

"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of unripe and bad oranges. 

There are 1 bad oranges and 20% of 25 oranges are unripe. To find 20% of 25, we multiply 25 by 0.20 (which is the decimal form of 20%).

25 × 0.20 = 5 oranges are unripe.

Now, we add the number of bad and unripe oranges to find the total number of oranges that are not good. 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) = 6 oranges are not good.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges. 
25 (total) - 6 (not good) = 19 oranges are good.

First, let's add the cost of the material and the cost of the jeweler: $500 + $800 = $1300.

Next, we need to find 10% of $1300. To do this, we multiply $1300 by 0.1 (since 10% is the same as 0.1). So, 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost before insurance: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

The final answer is: $1430"
"Let's break down Marcy's pension situation. She works for 40 years, but she only gets the full pension for 10 years. After that, she gets 5% of the value of the pension for the remaining 20 years.

The full pension is $50,000/year for 10 years. To find the value of the pension after 10 years, we multiply the annual pension by the number of years: $50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000.

Now, we need to find 5% of the value of the pension, which is 0.05 * $500,000 = $25,000/year.

So, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000/year (for the first 10 years) + $25,000/year (for the remaining 20 years) = $75,000/year.

The final answer is: $75,000."
"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, and then add them together.

The first half of the year is 6 months, and the second half of the year is also 6 months. 

The initial amount charged per month is $140. 

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, she paid 10% less than the initial amount, which is 90% of the initial amount. 
90% of $140 is 0.9 * $140 = $126.

For the second half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $126 = $756.

The total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to know the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We can find this by dividing the distance she traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

total miles = tank capacity * mpg
total miles = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total miles = 300 miles

"To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we need to know how much laundry each of them does. 

First, we know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. Since David does 1/4 of what Sarah does, we can find David's laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 4.

David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, we can find Raymond's laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2.

Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

Now, we can find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do by subtracting David's laundry from Raymond's laundry.

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 10% increase for 5 years, and then calculate the salary for the next 3 years.

First, we need to find the salary after 5 years. The initial salary is $600, and the company increases it by 10% every year. To find the increase, we multiply the initial salary by 0.1 (which is 10% as a decimal).

Increase = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 5 years = Initial salary + (Increase * 5)
= $600 + ($60 * 5)
= $600 + $300
= $900

Now, we need to calculate the salary for the next 3 years. We will apply the 10% increase to the salary after 5 years.

Increase = 0.1 * $900 = $90
Salary after 6 years = $900 + $90 = $990
Salary after 7 years = $990 + $99 = $1089
Salary after 8 years = $1089 + $109.1 = $1198.1

"To find out how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of guests.

Let's first find 1/4 of 16, which is 4. Then, we subtract that from 16 to get the number of guests who will attend.

16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

9 * $2 = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed for the picnic, we need to calculate the amount eaten by adults and children separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total amount eaten by adults. Since each adult will eat 10 pounds of potato salad and there are 20 adults, we multiply the number of adults by the amount each adult will eat: 20 * 10 = 200 pounds.

Next, we need to find the total amount eaten by children. Since children will eat half as much as adults, we can find the amount each child will eat by dividing the adult amount by 2: 10 / 2 = 5 pounds. Then, we multiply the amount each child will eat by the number of children: 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

Now, we add the total amount eaten by adults and children to find the total amount of potato salad needed: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

The final answer is: 225"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Cindy has 4 pets. Since Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, we can find Marcia's total by adding 2 to Cindy's total: 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Now, we're told that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. To find Jan's total, we multiply Marcia's total by 3: 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find Jackson's age, we need to determine the ages of the other family members first. We know that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. This means Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Next, we're told that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. So, Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Now, we know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. To find Jackson's age, we subtract 5 from Amy's age: 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find Gerald's new time, we need to first find his original time. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can add 2 seconds to Lee's time to get Gerald's original time. Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, so Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means we need to find 10% of 40 and subtract it from 40 to get his new time. To find 10% of 40, we multiply 0.1 by 40, which is 4 seconds.

Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. If there are 2 cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, then the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

The combined number of dogs and cats is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

Since the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats, the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we need to determine the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

First, let's find the number of girls. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 must be girls. 

Number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 3/5 * 200 = (3 * 200) / 5 = 600 / 5 = 120

Now, we need to find the number of girls in the girl scout. 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout.

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 2/3 * 120 = (2 * 120) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total girls - Girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we need to find the difference between the hours Harry and James slept. 
Harry slept 9 hours and James slept 6 hours, so the difference is 9 - 6 = 3 hours.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to figure out the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and the tomatoes lose half their volume, the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be 2 times the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find out how many cans Freda used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we can multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway, and 5 of them took an exit. So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes. Let's represent the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Then, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:
x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many potted plants Mary already has. Since she has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, we multiply the number of plants per ledge by the total number of ledges: 2 * 40 = 80.

Next, we need to add the 18 new potted plants she received from the nursery to the total number of plants she already has: 80 + 18 = 98.

Now, we know that Mary will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges. So, we subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she had: 98 - 40 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to find the number of doorbell rings for each friend and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find this, we multiply 20 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing by 4. So, 20 ÷ 4 = 5. Then, we add 5 to 20 to get 25.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Since the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, we add 10 to 60 to get 70.

Now, let's add up the number of doorbell rings for each friend: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all his textbooks. 

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (History) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract those from the total to find out how many pages are left to read.

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average per day, we need to divide the remaining pages by the number of days.

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately, and then add them together.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed). Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and one before bed) and 1 glass of soda with dinner. So, he drinks 3 glasses of water on each weekend day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

In total, John drinks 20 glasses of water on weekdays and 6 glasses of water on weekends. So, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 20 + 6 = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how long it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to know the rate at which it covers the city and the total distance of the city.

The fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. This means its rate is 3 miles per 10 minutes. To find the rate in miles per minute, we can divide 3 by 10.

3 miles / 10 minutes = 0.3 miles per minute

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it takes to cover the whole city. The city is 42 miles across. We can use the rate we found to set up a proportion or simply divide the total distance by the rate.

42 miles / 0.3 miles per minute = 140 minutes

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

The final answer is: 140"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. First, Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces on the board. To find a quarter of 1000, we can divide 1000 by 4.

1000 ÷ 4 = 250

So, Poppy places 250 pieces. Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left. We subtract the number of pieces Poppy placed from the total number of pieces.

1000 - 250 = 750

Now, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. To find a third of 750, we can divide 750 by 3.

750 ÷ 3 = 250

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after her mom placed 250 pieces. We subtract the number of pieces her mom placed from the remaining pieces.

750 - 250 = 500

Therefore, there are 500 pieces left to be placed.

The final answer is: 500"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir eats. If Amir eats 5 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Cody eats by multiplying the number of cookies Amir eats by 3.

Cody eats 3 × 5 = 15 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies they eat together, we need to add the number of cookies Amir eats and the number of cookies Cody eats.

Total cookies = 5 (Amir's cookies) + 15 (Cody's cookies) = 20 cookies.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the inner volume of the boxes, we need to calculate the volume of one box first. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length × width × height.

The length of the box is 5 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner length is 5 - 2 = 3 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).

The width of the box is 6 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner width is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.

The height of the box is 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner height is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: 3 × 4 × 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3: 24 × 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV and subtract the time spent watching other episodes.

Let's break it down:

- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 2 * 1 = 2 hours of 1-hour episodes.
- On Thursday, he watched 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours of 1-hour and 30-minute episodes.
- On Friday, he watched 2 * 1 = 2 hours of 1-hour episodes.

Total time spent watching 1-hour episodes is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Now, let's find the total time spent watching TV: 7 hours.

Time spent watching 30-minute episodes is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes is 1.5 / 0.5 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that after dropping 5 cookies, Henry had 110 cookies left. This means he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies before dropping any.

However, he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the number of cookies he actually baked is 115 + 15 = 130.

Since he wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, we can set up the equation: 2x = 130, where x is the number of cookies he baked last year.

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 130 ÷ 2 = 65.

The final answer is: 65"
"To find out how much gas will cost after the cashback rewards, we need to calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards and then subtract the cashback rewards.

The gas station sells gas for $3.00 per gallon, and the app company offers a cashback of $0.20 per gallon. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, we can calculate the total cost of gas without rewards as follows:

Total cost of gas without rewards = 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon
= $30.00

Now, let's calculate the total cashback rewards:

Total cashback rewards = 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon
= $2.00

To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost of gas without rewards:

Total cost of gas after rewards = Total cost of gas without rewards - Total cashback rewards
= $30.00 - $2.00
= $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each of them ate and then divide by 2.

Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, so the total number of roll-ups she ate is 2 * 24 = 48.

Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, so the total number of roll-ups he ate is 3 * 14 = 42.

Now, we add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each and divide by 2 to find the average.

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed and multiply it by 2 liters per set.

First, let's find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed in 64 seconds. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the rate of rowing in feet per second: 

20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second.

Now, let's divide the total time by the rate to find the total distance rowed: 

64 seconds / 1.25 feet/second = 51.2 feet.

Since we are only interested in sets of 10 feet, we can divide the total distance by 10: 

51.2 feet / 10 = 5.12 sets.

Since each set takes on 2 liters of water, we can multiply the number of sets by 2: 

5.12 sets * 2 liters/set = 10.24 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10.24}$"
"To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

There are 4 teachers, and each teacher has 2 lessons per day. So, the total number of lessons per day is 4 x 2 = 8.

The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. Therefore, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 x 3 = 24.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then we can set up an equation to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold:

Let B = number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold
6B = 1800 (since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone)
B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now that we know Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, we can use the information that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50.

Number of birds in Jamal's photograph = 300 / 50
= 6

"To find the profit Sasha makes from selling the lumber, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total revenue from selling it.

First, let's find the total cost of the lumber. Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $10 each, so the cost of these boards is 10 x $10 = $100. She also has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $16 each, so the cost of these boards is 5 x $16 = $80. The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. So, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 x 1.5 = $15 each, and the new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 x 1.5 = $24 each.

Now, let's find the total revenue from selling the lumber. Sasha can sell the 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards for $15 each, so the total revenue from these boards is 10 x $15 = $150. She can sell the 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards for $24 each, so the total revenue from these boards is 5 x $24 = $120. The total revenue from selling the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20.

We can then find the fraction of the total mixture that is sugar by dividing the number of parts of sugar by the total number of parts: 7/20.

Now, we can multiply this fraction by the total amount of the mixture (120) to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar:

So, John paid a total of $360 for the shoes.

The final answer is: $360"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each on the first day, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we need to find out how many vehicles were brought in on the second day. We know that the total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles brought in on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers brought in on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles brought in on the second day by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Lylah was making four years ago. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. This means Lylah's salary was 70% of Adrien's salary. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, then Lylah's salary four years ago was 0.7 * $40000 = $28000.

Four years later, both Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased by 40%. To find their new salaries, we need to calculate 40% of their old salaries and add it to their old salaries.

Adrien's new salary is $40000 + 0.4 * $40000 = $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

Lylah's new salary is $28000 + 0.4 * $28000 = $28000 + $11200 = $39200.

To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries: $56000 + $39200 = $95200.

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Julia initially had some spoons, then her husband gave her 5 more, and then she used 3 spoons. After all these events, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons Julia initially had as 'x'. 

When her husband gave her 5 more spoons, she had a total of x + 5 spoons. 

Then, she used 3 spoons, so she had (x + 5) - 3 spoons left.

We know that after using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:

x = 10

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages.

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of each item. We know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, we can multiply the cost of a pepper by 3 to get the cost of a watermelon: 3 × $15 = $45.

Next, we need to find the cost of an orange. We know that an orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so we can subtract 5 from the cost of a watermelon to get the cost of an orange: $45 - $5 = $40.

Now that we know the cost of each item, we can calculate the total cost of each item. Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so the total cost of watermelons is 4 × $45 = $180. He buys 20 peppers, so the total cost of peppers is 20 × $15 = $300. He buys 10 oranges, so the total cost of oranges is 10 × $40 = $400.

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we add the cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges together: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total revenue from patients.

First, let's find the total time spent by doctors. We know the hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. 

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total minutes to hours.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Now, we can find the total cost for the doctors. The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital.

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Next, we need to find the total revenue from patients. The hospital charges $200 an hour to each patient. We already know the total time spent by doctors, which is 200 hours. However, we need to find the total time spent by patients. Since the hospital sees 500 patients a day, and each patient is seen for 24 minutes, the total time spent by patients is the same as the total time spent by doctors, which is 200 hours.

Total revenue = Total time spent by patients * Hourly rate
Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour
Total revenue = $40000

However, this is not correct. The total revenue should be the total time spent by patients multiplied by the hourly rate charged to the patients. Since the hospital sees 500 patients a day, and each patient is seen for 24 minutes, the total time spent by patients is 200 hours. But the hospital charges $200 an hour to each patient, and each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours. So, the total revenue is:

Total revenue = 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient * $200/hour
Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour
Total revenue = $40000

However, this is still not correct. The correct total revenue is:

Total revenue = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient * ($200/hour) / 60 minutes/hour
Total revenue = 2000 * $200/hour
Total revenue = $400000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $400000 - $30000
Profit = $370000

The final answer is: $370000"
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we need to find a third of the total number of elves. A third of 60 is calculated as 60 ÷ 3 = 20. So, 20 elves quit after children vomit on them.

2. Now, we subtract the number of elves who quit from the total number of elves. 60 - 20 = 40 elves are left.

3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the remaining number of elves. 40 - 10 = 30 elves are left.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June.

Expenditure in May = $500
Expenditure in June = Expenditure in May - $60
Expenditure in June = $500 - $60
Expenditure in June = $440

Total expenditure = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June
Total expenditure = $500 + $440
Total expenditure = $940

The final answer is: $940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides each person took and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Each ride costs $6, so the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles on Tuesday.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday, so we can subtract these from the total to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday: 
41 - 4 - 24 = 13 miles.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much Tom pays for car washes in a year, we need to calculate the total cost of car washes per month and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. To find the total cost per month, we multiply the number of car washes by the cost per car wash:

4 car washes/month × $15/car wash = $60/month

Now, we multiply the total cost per month by 12 to get the total cost per year:

$60/month × 12 months/year = $720/year

The final answer is: $720"
"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially has 20 video games but lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply Brian's remaining video games by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times Brian's remaining video games is 3 × 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

So, Bobby has 40 video games."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the total unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this by dividing the total number of unicorns by 3.

   Total unicorns = 27
   Unicorns in Scottish Highlands = 27 ÷ 3 = 9

2. Now, we need to find the number of female Scottish unicorns. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands by 2/3.

   Female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) × 9
   Female Scottish unicorns = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of the items, add the delivery fee, and then add the tip.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items:

- 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
- Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost of the items. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20:

0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

Now, we add the delivery fee to the total cost of the items:

$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the tip, which is $5.00:

$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark took a test with 75 questions and another test with 100 questions. He completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. We need to find out how many questions he left incomplete in both tests.

First, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test. Since he completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour and he had 8 hours, we can multiply the number of hours by the rate:

8 hours * 5 questions/hour = 40 questions

However, Mark only had 8 hours to complete 75 questions, so he didn't have enough time to finish the test. We need to find out how many questions he would have completed if he had enough time. To do this, we can divide the total number of questions by the rate:

75 questions / 5 questions/hour = 15 hours

Since Mark only had 8 hours, he completed 40 questions in the first test.

Now, let's move on to the second test. Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. We can multiply the number of hours by the rate:

6 hours * 5 questions/hour = 30 questions

However, Mark only had 6 hours to complete 100 questions, so he didn't have enough time to finish the test. We need to find out how many questions he would have completed if he had enough time. To do this, we can divide the total number of questions by the rate:

100 questions / 5 questions/hour = 20 hours

Since Mark only had 6 hours, he completed 30 questions in the second test.

Now, let's add up the number of questions Mark completed in both tests:

40 questions (first test) + 30 questions (second test) = 70 questions

The total number of questions in both tests is 75 + 100 = 175 questions. To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we can subtract the number of questions he completed from the total number of questions:

175 questions - 70 questions = 105 questions

The final answer is: 105"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to first find four times the number of blue gumballs. 

Four times the number of blue gumballs is 4 * 12 = 48.

Since there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs, we add 22 to 48 to find the total number of pink gumballs. 

48 + 22 = 70

So, there are 70 pink gumballs in the machine.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to know the total number of semi-automatic cars first. 

We have a total of 20 cars. Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total.

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know there are 700 bees in total. We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queens.

Let's use variables to represent the number of each type of bee: B for baby bees, W for worker bees, and Q for queens.

Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, we can write an equation: W = 2B.

We also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write another equation: B = 2Q.

Now, we know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation: W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B into the equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation to get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find B by substituting Q into the equation B = 2Q. So, B = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find W by substituting B into the equation W = 2B. So, W = 2(200) = 400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, if he spent his video game time working instead, he would work 2 hours more each day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

His hourly wage is $10, so the total amount of money he would earn in a week is 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find the total cost of everything John bought, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total cost of food items. John bought milk for 2 dollars and eggs for 3 dollars. So, the total cost of food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

Next, let's find the total cost of non-food items. John bought light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars. So, the total cost of non-food items is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost of non-food items by 0.1 (which is the same as 10%): 10 * 0.1 = 1 dollar.

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

Finally, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax to find the total cost: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 8 clients in total, and each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week: $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest and then multiply it by the number of harvests in a year.

First, we know that there are 100 pineapples per hectare. Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is 100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples.

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and add them together.

The first set has 500 pieces. 

The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.

The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

Now, we add the number of pieces in each set together: 
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, half of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.

Now, let's calculate the number of bees that have not returned yet. We know that 30 bees left in the first 6 hours and 15 bees returned in the next 6 hours. So, the number of bees that have not returned yet is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.

In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees that left the hive fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bees that have not returned yet. We know that 15 bees had not returned yet from the first 6 hours, and 60 bees left in the last 6 hours. So, the total number of bees that have not returned yet is 15 + 60 = 75 bees.

In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 15 bees return.

Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier.

Total given = Total cost + Change
Total given = $22 + $8

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up an equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has. Let's call the number of friends Dorothy has ""x"". Then, Charlie has 3x friends.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 12

To find the value of x, we need to isolate x by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:
3x / 3 = 12 / 3
x = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

Now, we know James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends on Facebook.

"To find out who wins the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is 5280 feet. His speed is 440 feet per minute.

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 5280 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 12 minutes

Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is 10,560 feet. His speed is 264 feet per minute.

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10,560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 12 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve

"To find out how much money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * $0.25 = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * $0.25 = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * $0.25 = $0.25.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Dave initially ate 14 french fries. Then, a seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries. So, the total number of fries eaten so far is 14 + 7 = 21.

Next, three pigeons came and ate 3 fries each, which is a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Now, the total number of fries eaten is 21 + 9 = 30.

Let's denote the total number of fries initially as x. After the pigeons ate, (x - 30) fries were left. A raccoon then ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3)(x - 30). The number of fries left after the raccoon ate is (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).

We can simplify this to (1/3)(x - 30). After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6. Then, multiply both sides by 3: x - 30 = 18. Finally, add 30 to both sides: x = 48.

"To find out how many hours Kimo spends in class, we need to figure out how many hours he spends in class each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a semester.

Kimo has 3 classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Each class is 1 hour long, so that's 3 hours a day for those days. Since there are 3 days, that's 3 x 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each 2 hours long. That's 4 hours a day for those days. Since there are 2 days, that's 4 x 2 = 8 hours.

So, in total, Kimo spends 9 + 8 = 17 hours in class each week.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, we multiply 17 hours by 16 weeks to get the total hours Kimo spends in class: 17 x 16 = 272 hours.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's find the total length of each type of baked good. We know that there are 300 rolls, each 4 inches long, 120 croissants, each 6 inches long, and 60 baguettes, each 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches: 2 feet * 12 inches/foot = 24 inches.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12:

3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet

The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 2 x 400 = 800 bananas.

The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 2 x 100 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we add these numbers together: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19.

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

To find the total number of fish caught by Locsin, we add these numbers together: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13.

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin. We add the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin: 19 + 13 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price.

The initial price of a bag of marbles is $20. The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

Let's calculate the price after 36 months:

After 2 months, the price will be:
Price = Initial price + (Initial price * Increase percentage)
= $20 + ($20 * 0.20)
= $20 + $4
= $24

After 4 months, the price will be:
Price = $24 + ($24 * 0.20)
= $24 + $4.80
= $28.80

After 6 months, the price will be:
Price = $28.80 + ($28.80 * 0.20)
= $28.80 + $5.76
= $34.56

We can see a pattern here. The price is increasing by $4, $4.80, $5.76, and so on. This is a geometric sequence where each term is 1.2 times the previous term.

Let's use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence to find the price after 36 months:

an = a1 * r^(n-1)

where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a1 = $24 (the price after 2 months), r = 1.2 (the common ratio), and n = 18 (since we want to find the price after 36 months, which is 18 periods of 2 months).

a18 = $24 * (1.2)^(18-1)
= $24 * (1.2)^17
= $24 * 12.183776
= $291.41

The final answer is: $291.41"
"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the doll. We know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since one action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

Next, we need to find the total cost of the red cars and the action figures. There are 5 red cars, each costing $4, so the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20. There are 3 action figures, each costing $5, so the total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's add the cost of the doll, the red cars, and the action figures to find the total worth of all the toys: $15 + $20 + $15 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"So, let's figure out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant to do her taxes. If she does the taxes herself, she'll lose out on 3 hours of freelance work, which pays $35 per hour. That's a total of $105 she'll miss out on.

The accountant charges $90 to do the taxes. To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself.

Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105
Cost of hiring the accountant = $90

Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to subtract the total cost of the computer accessories from her budget.

First, let's add up the cost of all the accessories:

Computer: €1090
Scanner: €157
CD burner: €74
Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1323

Now, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:
€1500 - €1323 = €177

Elvira will have €177 left for her clothing."
"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to determine how many eggs she needs in total and then divide that by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

First, we need to calculate the total number of eggs required. Since Sandra is making 15 Spanish flans and each flan needs 3 eggs, we multiply the number of flans by the number of eggs per flan: 15 * 3 = 45 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job: 45 ÷ 9 = 5.

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. If we let Brooke's current age be B, then Seth's current age is 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and 2B + 2. The sum of their ages will be 28, so we can write an equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

So, Seth is 16 years old.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has. Since Ethel has $8, we multiply 8 by 2 to get 2 × 8 = $16.

Jimmy has $18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks in 7 days. 

Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is a total of 5 days. We can calculate this by multiplying 20 miles by 5 days: 20 * 5 = 100 miles.

On the weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles a day, which is a total of 2 days. We can calculate this by multiplying 10 miles by 2 days: 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked from Monday to Friday and the miles walked on Saturday and Sunday: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat, so it is 3 × $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The final answer is: $150"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each group and add them together.

First, let's find the total number of legs for the spiders. Since each spider has 8 legs, we multiply the number of spiders by the number of legs per spider: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs.

Next, we'll find the total number of legs for the insects. Each insect has 6 legs, so we multiply the number of insects by the number of legs per insect: 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs.

Lastly, we'll find the total number of legs for the mutant invertebrates. Each invertebrate has 10 legs, so we multiply the number of invertebrates by the number of legs per invertebrate: 3 invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs for each group together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

The final answer is: 1210"
"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, and Sally Four.

We know that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so we can express this relationship as an equation: G = 2S, where G represents Granny Red's age and S represents Sally Four's age. Since S = 8, we can substitute this value into the equation to find G: G = 2(8) = 16.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so we can express this relationship as an equation: S2 = G + 3, where S2 represents Sally Two's age. Since G = 16, we can substitute this value into the equation to find S2: S2 = 16 + 3 = 19.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages together: S2 + S + G + S32 = 19 + 8 + 16 + 8 = 51.

The final answer is: 51"
"To figure out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total monthly payment and then multiply it by 12.

- Student loans: $300 * 1.5 = $450
- Credit card: $200 * 1.5 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 * 1.5 = $750

Now, let's add up the increased minimum payments:
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

Since Jessica pays this amount each month, we multiply it by 12 to get the total annual payment:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Total time to peel and cut all potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

The final answer is: 95"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade. Since they sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, the total revenue per gallon is:

20 glasses/gallon × $0.50/glass = $10/gallon

Since they made a profit of $25, their total revenue is the sum of the profit and the cost. Let's call the total cost ""x"". Then, the total revenue is:

Total revenue = Profit + Cost
Total revenue = $25 + x

Since they sell each gallon for $10, the number of gallons they sold is:

Number of gallons = Total revenue / $10

We can now substitute the expression for total revenue:

Number of gallons = ($25 + x) / $10

The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. The cost of sugar per gallon is $2, so the cost of lemons per gallon is:

Cost of lemons per gallon = $5 - $2 = $3

The total cost of lemons is the cost of lemons per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons:

Total cost of lemons = Cost of lemons per gallon × Number of gallons
Total cost of lemons = $3 × (($25 + x) / $10)

Since we are given that the total profit is $25, we can set up the equation:

Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$10 × Number of gallons - ($3 × Number of gallons) - ($2 × Number of gallons) = $25

Substituting the expression for the number of gallons:

$10 × (($25 + x) / $10) - $5 × (($25 + x) / $10) = $25

Simplifying the equation:

(10 - 5) × (($25 + x) / $10) = $25
5 × (($25 + x) / $10) = $25
(25 + x) / 2 = $25
25 + x = $50
x = $25

Now that we have the total cost, we can find the cost of lemons:

Total cost = $25
Cost of lemons per gallon = $3
Total cost of lemons = $25

The final answer is: $25"
"To find the number of Chinese participants, we need to subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants.

Total participants = 240

"To find out how much money Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, let's calculate the amount spent on rent: 1/4 of 6000 is 600. 

Next, we calculate the amount spent on car fuel: 1/3 of 6000 is 2000.

Now, we subtract these amounts from his total income: 6000 - 600 - 2000 = 3400.

Then, we calculate the amount donated to charity: 1/2 of 3400 is 1700.

After that, we subtract the donation from the remaining amount: 3400 - 1700 = 1700.

Next, we calculate the total amount given to his daughter and wife: 200 + 700 = 900.

Finally, we subtract this amount from the remaining amount: 1700 - 900 = 800.

So, Zaid has $800 left after all his expenses and donations.

"To find the total number of crabs, we need to determine the number of crabs each person has. 

Let's start with Bo, who has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, we can find Monic's number of crabs by subtracting 4 from Bo's total: 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Now, we know that Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. To find Rani's total, we add 10 to Monic's total: 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

To find the total number of crabs, we add the number of crabs each person has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations and 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.

Let's start by finding the number of white carnations. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and there are 200 pink calla lilies. We can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

5x = 200

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 200 ÷ 5
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. We can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

y = 4x
y = 4(40)
y = 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jean is two years older than Mark. We can represent Mark's age as M and Jean's age as J. So, we have the equation:

J = M + 2

We also know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30, two years ago Jan was 28. We can represent Mark's age two years ago as M - 2. We can write an equation to represent the situation two years ago:

M - 2 = (1/2) * 28 + 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19

Adding 2 to both sides of the equation, we get:

M = 21

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:

J = M + 2
J = 21 + 2
J = 23

"To find the time difference between the two teams, we need to calculate the total time for each team.

The well-rounded team's total time is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 222 = -2 seconds. However, since time can't be negative, we need to find the absolute difference. The absolute difference is 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) and 6 total outcomes. So, the probability is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 50%.

Next, we need to find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a six-sided die. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 = 1/2. Since the two events are independent, we multiply the probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row. 

50% - 25% = 25%

So, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Additionally, there is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

First, let's find the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters. Since there are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Next, we know that the rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw.

Now, let's find the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits. This is simply 50 + 20 = 70.

We are told that a total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents. Since 70 pieces are given to the hamsters and the rabbits, the remaining straw pieces are given to the rats. So, the number of straw pieces given to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can set up an equation to find the number of rats in each cage. Let's call the number of rats in each cage 'r'. Then, the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r.

We know that the total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 90, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r, we can set up the equation 3r = 15. Solving for 'r', we get r = 5.

"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to figure out the total cost and total revenue.

Let's say the number of bags is 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population. 

First, let's add the number of men and women to find the total number of adults.

Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092
Total adults = Number of men + Number of women
= 8417 + 9092
= 17509

Now, we can subtract the total number of adults from the total population to find the number of children.

Total population = 23786
Number of children = Total population - Total adults
= 23786 - 17509
= 6277

"To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them to the initial number.

Let's start with the initial number of cards Elaine had: 20.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number: 3 × 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: 2 × (60 + 40) = 2 × 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month and the initial number: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

The final answer is: 320"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark is a copy-editor who edits sentences for two different publishers. He edits an equal number of sentences each week for both publishers. Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents.

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence. The total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amount he makes from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

"To find out how much money John made that year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then multiply it by the number of weeks he worked.

First, let's find 5% of his old salary:
5% of $2000 = 0.05 * 2000 = $100
New salary = Old salary + Raise
= $2000 + $100
= $2100

Since John got the award on the first day of the year, he will have the new salary for all 52 weeks of the year. 

Total amount made that year = New salary * Number of weeks
= $2100 * 52
= $109,200

The total amount John made that year is $109,200."

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total slices used for sandwiches. Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week, which is 7 days. He used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. So, the total slices used for sandwiches is 7 x 2 = 14.

Next, let's find the total slices used for omelets. Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week. He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, which is 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. So, the total slices used for omelets is 3 x 3 = 9.

Now, let's find the total slices used for the macaroni and cheese dish. Carl used 8 slices of cheese in it.

Now, let's add the slices used for each meal together:
Total slices = 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. To find the total number of pens she had initially, we add the number of green pens to the number of yellow pens: 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Then, Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens and 2 bags of red pens. Each bag of blue pens contains 9 pens, and each bag of red pens contains 6 pens. To find the total number of blue pens she bought, we multiply the number of bags by the number of pens in each bag: 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens. Similarly, to find the total number of red pens she bought, we multiply the number of bags by the number of pens in each bag: 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, we add the number of blue pens and red pens she bought to find the total number of new pens: 54 + 12 = 66 pens.

To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98 pens.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score needed = 93 × 6 = 558

Next, we need to find the total score of the first five tests. We add up the scores of the first five tests.

Total score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score of the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score of the remaining four tests, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests.

Total score of remaining four tests = 338 - 71 = 267

Since Brinley needs a total score of 558 for the semester, we need to find the score she needs on the sixth test. We subtract the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score needed.

Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 267 = 291

"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers for each period and add them together.

First, let's calculate the total kilometers for the first four weeks. Since Michael rode his bike 5 times a week for 25 kilometers each time, we multiply the number of kilometers per ride by the number of rides per week and then by the number of weeks:

25 km/ride * 5 rides/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 km

Next, let's calculate the total kilometers for the next three weeks. Michael rode his bike 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time, so we multiply the number of kilometers per ride by the number of rides per week and then by the number of weeks:

60 km/ride * 2 rides/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 km

Now, let's add the total kilometers for both periods to find the overall total:

500 km + 360 km = 860 km

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. We know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars. So, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Next, we need to find the weight of the candied apples. We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we can find the total weight of the bag of candy by adding the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"To find the cost of each cup, we need to first calculate the total cost of twenty dozen cups and then divide it by the number of cups.

First, let's find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to earn and subtract the amount she already has.

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 + 2 * $20 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Let's calculate how much more money she needs to earn: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: 4 * $5 = $20.

The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns each time: $40 / $4 = 10.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Jerry has a certain number of red chickens and white chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. The total number of eggs collected is 42.

Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We also know that W = R + 2.

The total number of eggs collected can be represented by the equation: 3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(l + w)
P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers on the third day, we need to know the total number of customers on the first two days and then add the number of customers on the third day.

Let's start by finding the total number of customers on the first two days. We know that there were 100 customers on the first day and 50 more customers on the second day. So, the total number of customers on the second day is 100 + 50 = 150.

Now, we know that the total number of customers by the third day is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we need to subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total by the third day.

Customers on Day 3 = Total by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - (100 + 150)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - 250
Customers on Day 3 = 250

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that both pools have leaks that empty them out at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. This means that in 1 minute, 4 gallons are lost from each pool.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, it had 2x gallons of water.

Now, let's consider the situation now. Since 4 minutes have passed, 4 gallons have been lost from each pool. So, the small pool now has x - 4 gallons of water, and the big pool has 2x - 4 gallons of water.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-4 = 2x - 16

Adding 16 to both sides:

12 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

6 = x

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. The amount of water in the small pool now is 6 - 4 = 2 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to first determine their current ages and then add 3 to each age.

We know that Harriet is 21 years old now. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. Zack's age is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so we multiply Harriet's age by 3 to find Adrian's age. Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

Now that we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63), we can find their ages in three years by adding 3 to each age: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3:

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored.

Let's start with Naomi's points. Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. To find half of Naomi's points, we divide 68 by 2, which is 68 ÷ 2 = 34. Then, we add 10 to that result to find Yuri's points: 34 + 10 = 44.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so we add 17 to Naomi's points: 68 + 17 = 85.

Now, we add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find Jojo's points: 251 - 197 = 54.

"To find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many melons were ready for harvest after two months. Since 30% of the watermelons were ready, we can calculate this by multiplying 120 (the total number of melons) by 0.3 (which is the decimal form of 30%).

120 * 0.3 = 36

So, 36 melons were ready for harvest after two months. This means that 84 melons were left (120 - 36).

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining melons were ready for harvest after two weeks. We're told that 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so we can calculate this by multiplying 84 by 3/4.

84 * (3/4) = 84 * 0.75 = 63

This means that 63 melons were ready for harvest after two weeks. To find the number of melons not ready to be harvested, we subtract the number of melons ready for harvest from the total number of melons remaining after two months.

84 - 63 = 21

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fee.

First, we find the total cost of the cars: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000.

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. Since Mark pays 10% tax, we multiply the total cost of the cars by 0.1 (which is the decimal form of 10%): 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

Then, we find the registration fee: 12 cars * $1000 per car = $12,000.

Finally, we add up the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fee: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

Kylie's Monday collection = Robert's Monday collection + 5
Kylie's Monday collection = 20 + 5
Kylie's Monday collection = 25

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells she collects on Tuesday, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2.

Kylie's Tuesday collection = 2 × Kylie's Monday collection
Kylie's Tuesday collection = 2 × 25
Kylie's Tuesday collection = 50

6 tomatoes/day × 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. So, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes/day. 
His girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes/day × 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine to find the number of vines needed: 
63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

The final answer is: 21"
"To figure out how many pizzas John needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of slices required and divide it by the number of slices per pizza.

First, we find the total number of slices needed. Since there are 20 friends and each friend gets 4 slices, we multiply the number of friends by the number of slices per friend: 20 * 4 = 80.

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza, which is 8. So, we have 80 ÷ 8 = 10.

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Ram buys 25 pens and uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low. He can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens. 

To find the total number of pens Ram gets, we need to calculate the number of new pens he can make from the ink of the 25 pens he buys. 

First, we divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many sets of 5 pens he has: 25 ÷ 5 = 5. This means he has 5 sets of 5 pens.

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the number of new pens he can make from each set: 5 sets × 1 new pen/set = 5 new pens.

So, the total number of pens he gets is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens he made: 25 + 5 = 30 pens.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the amount of money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we need to calculate the initial amount of money Johnny had after adding the extra $10 to his allowance. This is simply $20 + $10 = $30.
2. Next, we need to find the amount of money after it tripled in a year. To do this, we multiply the initial amount by 3: $30 * 3 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, we can find Joan's age by adding 5 years to Jessa's age. This is because Joan is 5 years older than Jessa. So, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.

Next, we can find Mary's age by subtracting 2 years from Joan's age. This is because Mary is 2 years younger than Joan. So, Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages by adding their individual ages together: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow the given sequence of events.

First, we find the number of students who went out through exit A. 30% of the students went out through exit A, which is 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.

Now, we need to find the number of students who went out through exit B. 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. The remaining students are 1000 - 300 = 700. So, 3/5 of 700 is (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

Now, we need to find the number of students who went out through exit C. The remaining students after exit B are 700 - 420 = 280.

The final answer is: 280"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that John has 54 candies. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can find the number of candies Robert has by dividing John's candies by 2.

Robert's candies = John's candies / 2
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

Now, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can find the number of candies James has by adding 6 to Robert's candies.

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has.

Difference in candies = John's candies - James' candies
Difference in candies = 54 - 33
Difference in candies = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two people, Dolly and Pandora, and they each have a certain number of books. Dolly has 2 books, and Pandora has 1 book.

Since they both read their own books, Dolly will read 2 books (her own 2 books) and Pandora will read 1 book (her own 1 book). They will also read each other's books, so Dolly will read Pandora's 1 book, and Pandora will read Dolly's 2 books.

To find the total number of books read, we need to add up the number of books each person reads. Dolly reads 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books. Pandora reads 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books.

So, the total number of books read is 3 (by Dolly) + 3 (by Pandora) = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mike has 5 pen pals initially, but he stops being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he's left with 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.

Each of his remaining pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds to each letter. That means he receives 2 * 3 = 6 letters a week from his pen pals.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 ÷ 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes he used for his daily calls and the extra minutes, then subtract that from his total minutes.

First, let's find out how many minutes Jason used for his daily calls. Since he has a 15-minute call with his boss every day and there are 30 days in the month, we multiply the number of minutes per call by the number of days:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Next, we add the extra minutes he used to talk to other people:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in the plan:

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left on his phone plan.

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Next, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two aquariums with snails and fish. One aquarium has 4 snails, and the other has 32 snails. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

We're told that this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, let's call the number of fish in each aquarium ""x"". The total number of fish is 2x.

We can set up an equation based on the given information:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can start by simplifying the right side of the equation:

28 = 4x

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate x:

x = 28 / 4

x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how much Jean paid for the makeup, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much she paid per day. Since she charges $250 an hour and it takes 6 hours to do each day, we multiply the two numbers together.

$250/hour * 6 hours/day = $1500/day

Since she needs to do this 4 times a week, we multiply the daily cost by 4.

$1500/day * 4 days/week = $6000/week

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so we multiply the weekly cost by 5.

$6000/week * 5 weeks = $30,000

After the movie is done, Jean gets a 10% discount. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1 (which is the same as 10%).

$30,000 * 0.1 = $3000

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid.

$30,000 - $3000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid for the party supplies, we need to calculate the total cost first. 

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle and her two parents split the cost evenly, there are 3 people in total. To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find the total cost of the onions, we need to multiply the total weight of the onions by the cost per pound.

First, we find the total weight of the onions. The chef bought 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. 

Total weight = 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag
Total weight = 200 pounds

Now, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound, which is $1.50.

Total cost = Total weight * Cost per pound
Total cost = 200 pounds * $1.50/pound
Total cost = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total number of calories each of them ate and then find the difference.

First, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate. We know that on Monday, she ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, and her sister ate 5 cookies. So, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, and her sister ate 13 cookies. So, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies Sue ate: 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.

Next, let's find out how many cookies her sister ate: 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can multiply the total number of cookies each of them ate by 200 to find the total calories they consumed. Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

To find the difference in calories consumed, we subtract the calories her sister consumed from the calories Sue consumed: 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5600}$"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of students in the school is 20 * 3 = 60.

The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

The number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 30.

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33.

However, we are given that each class has 20 students. So, the total number of students in the first two classes is 20 * 2 = 40.

The number of boys in the first two classes is 33, but the total number of students in the first two classes is 40. This means that the number of boys in the first two classes is actually 33, and the number of girls in the first two classes is 40 - 33 = 7.

This is a contradiction to the given information that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. 

However, if we assume that the given information is correct, then the number of boys in the third class is 20 - (15 + 12 - 7) = 20 - 20 = 0.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than the previous night.

Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed today as x. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of wolves killed is 10 (last night) + 36 (today) = 46.
The total number of cougars killed is 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the number of wolves and cougars: 46 + 27 = 73.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to determine how many times Anne went down the slide first. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Since Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4. 
21 * 4 = 84.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Mr. Sylas initially had 10 stalls with 20 cows each. So, the total number of cows he had initially is 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

Then, he bought 40 more cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. To find out how many cows he added to each stall, we divide the total number of cows bought by the number of stalls:

40 cows / 10 stalls = 4 cows per stall

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. To do this, we first need to find out how many cows are in one stall after Mr. Sylas added the new cows. We already know that each stall had 20 cows initially and 4 new cows were added, so:

20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows per stall

Now, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8 to find out how many cows are in 8 stalls:

24 cows per stall * 8 stalls = 24 * 8 = 192 cows

The final answer is: 192"
"To find the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the coins:

- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2.00
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2.00

Next, let's calculate the value of the dollar bills:
- 40 dollar bills = 40 x $1.00 = $40.00

Now, let's add the values together:
$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section.

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 ÷ 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 × 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight. 

To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 8000 × 0.3 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000: 8000 - 2400 = 5600.

The final weight of the redwood is 5600 pounds."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can find out how many apples Jamal has by subtracting 8 from 52. 

Jamal's apples = 52 - 8
Jamal's apples = 44

We also know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, we can find out how many bananas Jamal has by adding 4 to the number of apples he has.

Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4
Jamal's bananas = 48

Now, we know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. To find out how many bananas Andrea has, we can divide the number of bananas Jamal has by 2.

Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2
Andrea's bananas = 24

To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have.

Total fruits = Andrea's apples + Jamal's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's bananas
Total fruits = 52 + 44 + 24 + 48
Total fruits = 168

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then divide that by the number of cookies per cup of flour.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making: 66 / 12 = 5.5. 

Since 5.5 dozens is the same as 5 dozen and 6 cookies, we need to calculate the flour needed for 6 cookies. 6 cookies is half of a dozen, so we need half of 2 cups of flour, which is 1 cup.

Now, we need to add the flour needed for the remaining 5 dozen cookies. 5 dozen cookies need 5 * 2 = 10 cups of flour.

So, the total flour needed is 10 + 1 = 11 cups.

We can calculate this by multiplying 9,300 by 2 and then dividing by 3.

(2 * 9,300) / 3 = 18,600 / 3 = 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.

"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to add the marbles she already has to the marbles she received from her friend.

First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Maddison initially has. Since she has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box:

5 boxes × 50 marbles/box = 5 × 50 = 250 marbles

Next, we need to add the 20 marbles she received from her friend to the total number of marbles she already has:

Total marbles = 250 + 20 = 270

"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000. 

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. To find 5% of $350,000, we multiply 0.05 by $350,000. This gives us 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price. To find 12% of $350,000, we multiply 0.12 by $350,000. This gives us 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

Now, we add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee to find the total price of the house: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's find the transfer fees. 3% of the selling price is the same as 0.03 times the selling price. So, 3% of $400,000 is 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, we need to find the brokerage fee. This is 5% of the selling price, which is the same as 0.05 times the selling price. So, 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

Now, we add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees. $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

To find the net selling price, we subtract the total fees from the selling price. $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, we subtract the remaining loan amount from the net selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds. $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

"To find the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 20 (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 (to cook) = 71 minutes.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms. To find the number of M&Ms in the second bag, I simply added 12 to the number of M&Ms in the first bag.

The third bag has a hole in it, so it only has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had. To find the number of M&Ms in the third bag, I divided the number of M&Ms in the first bag by 2: 300 ÷ 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

"To find the change, we need to calculate the total cost of the items the mother bought. We add the cost of the cocoa, laundry, and pasta together.

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35
Total cost = $14.00

Now, we need to find the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount she paid, which is $20.

Change = $20 - $14.00
Change = $6.00

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first determine the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, and the body takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The final answer is: 315"
"To find the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the tomato seeds. Since she bought 20 packets of tomato seeds at $40 per packet, we multiply the number of packets by the cost per packet: 20 * $40 = $800.

Next, we find the cost of the celery seeds. Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds at $30 per packet, so we multiply the number of packets by the cost per packet: 80 * $30 = $2400.

Now, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds together to find the total cost: $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 × 54 = 108 lines. Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 ÷ 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) × 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to find the number of cards that do not have the letters A, B, or C.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is $\frac{2}{5} \cdot 80 = 32$ cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are $80 - 32 = 48$. 1/2 of 48 is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 48 = 24$ cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are $48 - 24 = 24$. 5/8 of 24 is $\frac{5}{8} \cdot 24 = 15$ cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: $80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.

Next, we'll find the time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 10 * 15 = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for small holes and large holes together: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we need to first understand that their current ages add up to 20. Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as m. We know that M + m = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be m + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (m + 10).

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms: (M + m) + 10 + 10. Since we know that M + m = 20, we can substitute this value into the expression: 20 + 10 + 10.

Now, let's add the numbers: 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We're given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the popsicles. Since Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, we multiply the number of popsicles by the cost per popsicle: 20 * $0.25 = $5.

Next, we find the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, so we multiply the number of ice cream bars by the cost per ice cream bar: 4 * $0.50 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid: $5 + $2 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the total number of spots on the snakes, we need to calculate the spots on the cobras and the mambas separately and then add them together.

First, we find the total number of spots on the cobras. There are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots. So, the total number of spots on the cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800.

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we divide the number of spots per cobra by 2 to find the number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, we find the total number of spots on the mambas. There are 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots. So, the total number of spots on the mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

To find the total number of spots on all the snakes, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Finally, we find half the total number of spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To find out how much Maddy will spend on pizzas, we need to calculate the total number of people she needs to buy for and then multiply that by the cost of each pizza.

First, let's find the total number of people. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. The total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first find the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.

The space between the gemstones is filled with sterling silver beads, and each bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we need to find the total length of the space between the gemstones. 

Since there are 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them. The total length of these spaces is 7 * (1/4) = 7/4 = 1.75 inches.

Now, we subtract the length taken up by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the spaces: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

However, we already know that the length of the spaces is 1.75 inches. To find the number of beads, we need to divide the length of the spaces by the length of each bead: 1.75 / (1/4) = 1.75 / 0.25 = 7.

So, Katerina uses 7 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot, we need to calculate the number of stories each of them wrote in the first week and the second week, then add them together.

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. So, Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

Total stories = 120 + 240 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the brother's current age, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2, since he is twice her age.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many cents Kelly has left after buying a can of pop, we need to calculate the total value of her quarters and dimes, then subtract the cost of the pop.

First, let's calculate the total value of her quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, we multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter: 5 x 25 = 125 cents.

Next, we calculate the total value of her dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, we multiply the number of dimes by the value of each dime: 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, we add the total value of her quarters and dimes to find the initial amount of money Kelly has: 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The cost of the can of pop is 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the initial amount: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we need to first calculate the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24.
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To figure out how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we need to know the weight of each flagstone and the weight capacity of the trucks. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and the trucks can carry a total of 2000 pounds.

First, we need to find the total weight of the flagstones. We can do this by multiplying the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone:

80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks to find out how many trucks are needed:

6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the time taken by the car in the slow lane, we need to know its speed and the distance it traveled. We know the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles at 60 miles/hour. 

First, let's find the time taken by the car in the fast lane. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the same formula to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane:
time = distance / speed = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ali has 22 medals, and his friend Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

Let's represent the total number of medals given out as x. Then, we can write the equation:

10x = 39

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 ÷ 10
x = 3.9

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.9}$"
"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, we multiply the number of packets by the number of chocolate bars in each packet: 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars.

Next, we need to find out how many chocolate bars the adults will get. Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars and there are 4 adults, we multiply the number of adults by the number of chocolate bars each adult gets: 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. We subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars.

Since there are 8 children, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get: 16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes first. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he doesn't get an extra point and still has 21 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 21 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 21 + 18 + 43 = 82.

The final answer is: $\boxed{82}$"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 
The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. 
He washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Since Will bought 15 oranges, to find out how many are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total: 
15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, each person consumes 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (2 kg).

42 kg ÷ 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the total number of days by 7.

21 days ÷ 7 days per week = 3 weeks

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and subtract that from his target.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any crates on those days. He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, and 18 on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18
Total crates sold = 65

Target = 120 crates

"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the number of bids made by the other 3 people and Carmen, and then calculate the total amount bid.

Since Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, there are 3 bids made by the other people. After each of these bids, Carmen also bids, so there are 3 bids made by Carmen. In total, there are 3 + 3 = 6 bids.

The initial bid is $200, and each subsequent bid is $50 more than the previous one. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term a = 200, the common difference d = 50, and the number of terms n = 6.

The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: S = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d)

Plugging in the values, we get:
S = (6/2) * (2*200 + (6-1)*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 5*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 250)
S = 3 * 650
S = 1950

"To figure out how much John pays for driving each year, we need to break it down into smaller parts.

First, let's find out how many miles John drives in a year. Since he goes to work and back each day, that's 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles per day. He goes to work 5 days a week, so that's 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. Since he does this for 50 weeks a year, he drives a total of 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Now, let's calculate the cost of driving. John is charged $2 per mile, so the total driving cost per year is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

To find the total cost per year, we add the total driving cost and the total bonus: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days.

Monday: 16 minutes

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on food and snacks, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's find out how much she spent on food and snacks. Since she spent half of $50, we can calculate this by dividing $50 by 2:

$$\frac{50}{2} = 25$$

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. To find the total amount she spent, we add these two amounts together:

$$25 + 10 = 35$$

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount to find out how much she has left:

$$50 - 35 = 15$$

Therefore, Annika has $15 left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Elise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years. We also know that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year. This year, she sold 45 books, so in the first year, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books.

We're also given that there are 50 unsold books left. To find out how many books she sold in the second year, we need to subtract the number of unsold books, the number of books sold this year, and the number of books sold in the first year from the total number of books.

Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books - Books sold this year - Books sold in the first year
= 250 - 50 - 45 - 90
= 65

Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is the number of books sold in the second year multiplied by the price per book.

Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

April has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to follow the steps below.

First, we need to find out how many loaves are sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. We can calculate this by multiplying 60 (the total number of loaves) by 2/3.

60 × (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. We subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning from the total number of loaves.

60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Next, we need to find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon. Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. We can calculate this by multiplying 20 (the number of loaves left) by 1/2.

20 × (1/2) = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the savings on the tubs of ice cream. The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

Next, let's find the savings on the packets of milk. The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. 
The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after 15 days, we need to figure out how many extra arms and legs they'll grow.

Let's start with the arms. Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, we can divide 15 by 3 to see how many 3-day periods are in 15 days. 

15 ÷ 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

Now, let's look at the legs. Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, we can divide 15 by 5 to see how many 5-day periods are in 15 days.

15 ÷ 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and legs together.

5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Theo has $6000 to spend on his business trip to South Africa. He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so we need to find out how much he has left to spend on other things like business suits, suitcases, and gifts for his business partners.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 suits * $100 = $600.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 = $150.

Now, let's find out how much the flight ticket costs. The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times this amount is $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the cost of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

To find out how much Theo has left, we'll subtract the total cost from his initial budget: $6000 - $1950 = $4050.

Since he wants to save $2000, we'll subtract this amount from the remaining budget: $4050 - $2000 = $2050.

This means he has $2050 left to spend on gifts for his business partners.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to first find the total number of eggs consumed in a day. 

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs they eat in a day is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. 

The rest of the family members are 5 - 3 = 2. They eat 2 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs they eat in a day is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, the total number of eggs consumed in a week (7 days) is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find Trent's age, we need to determine Jane's age first. Since Quinn is 30 and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can calculate Jane's age by subtracting 3 from Quinn's age.

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so we add 5 to Jane's age to find Trent's age.

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how old Noah was six years ago. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old at that time.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. This means that the current population of Chile is twice the population six years ago. Therefore, the current population of Chile is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the total number of players on the football team is 105. We also know that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, and half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. Then, the number of players on the offense is 2D, and the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2.

We can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Now, we can solve for D by dividing both sides by 7:

D = 210 / 7
D = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of people invited to Martha's party, we need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

First, let's find the total number of people from the 2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people.

Next, we'll find the total number of people from the 3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people.

Now, we add the number of people from both groups: 12 + 12 = 24 people.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. To find the number of people who are still invited, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16 people.

But, 1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. We need to subtract these people from the number of people who are still invited: 16 - 2 = 14 people.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Let's start by adding the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna to the marbles already in the store. He bought 20 marbles and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

Now, let's calculate the number of marbles Solomon's father gave him. His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5) × 20 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 × 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is length x width x height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Cost per cubic foot = $0.1
Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Since there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can find the number of girls by multiplying the number of boys by 3:
Girls = 3 × 30 = 90

Next, we need to find the number of nongendered children. We're told that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so we can find this by multiplying the number of boys by 1/10:
Nongendered children = 1/10 × 30 = 3

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's assume the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 ÷ 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many people left the party. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and there were 40 people initially. To find 1/4 of 40, we multiply 40 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 40 by 4.

40 ÷ 4 = 10

So, 10 people left the party. Since 22 men stayed, 25 - 22 = 3 men left. This means that 10 - 3 = 7 women left.

Now, we know that 15 women were at the party initially, and 7 left. To find out how many women are left, we subtract 7 from 15.

15 - 7 = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, we can calculate the magazine's cost by dividing the book's cost by 2.

The cost of the magazine = $4 / 2 = $2

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, to find the cost of the pen, we subtract $1 from the magazine's cost.

The cost of the pen = $2 - $1 = $1

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pencils are in each box. We know that Jam has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 x 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to figure out how much it's weakened by the ice cubes and the cream.

First, let's think about the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. If the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we need to find out how many ice cubes are needed to achieve this. We can do this by dividing the total temperature difference (65 degrees) by the temperature difference caused by each ice cube (13 degrees).

65 ÷ 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make it 5 x 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Next, we need to consider the cream. Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. So, we add this to the weakening caused by the ice cubes.

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many old records the 5 people brought in. Since they can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, we can set up a ratio to find out how many old records they traded for the 7 new records.

Let's use the ratio: 2 old records = 1 new record. We know they got 7 new records, so we can multiply the number of new records by 2 to find out how many old records they traded.

2 old records = 1 new record
7 new records * 2 old records/new record = 14 old records

So, the 5 people traded 14 old records for the 7 new records."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many junior programmers there are. We know that junior programmers make up 2/5 of the total number of employees, and there are 100 employees in total. To find 2/5 of 100, we multiply 100 by 2 and then divide by 5.

2/5 of 100 = (2 x 100) / 5
= 200 / 5
= 40

So, there are 40 junior programmers. Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Now, let's find out how much junior programmers make. We know they make $2000 per month.

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers x Salary of junior programmers
= 40 x $2000
= $80000

Next, we need to find out how much senior programmers make. We know they make $400 more than junior programmers, so they make $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers x Salary of senior programmers
= 60 x $2400
= $144000

Finally, we add the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers to find the total amount paid to all programmers.

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that at the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 people got on, so the net change in the number of people was 1 (8 - 7 = 1). 

If we let x be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, then at the first bus stop, 5 people got on, so the total number of people on the bus was x + 5. 

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 people got on, so the total number of people on the bus became (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6. 

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to know the rate at which it charges. The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. 

Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged. To find the time it takes to charge 40%, we multiply 40 by the time it takes to charge 1 percentage-point, which is 3 minutes.

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow a simple arithmetic sequence. First, we calculate the total number of lollipops Erin has after her mother gives her 10 more. 

Let's denote the initial number of lollipops Erin has as 7. Her mother gives her 10 more, so we add 10 to 7: 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Next, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract 3 from 17: 17 - 3 = 14.

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find out how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's figure out how many rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 they spend, they get a $1 reward. So, we divide $80 by $20 to find out how many rewards they earned: $80 ÷ $20 = 4 rewards.

Now, let's move on to the current shopping trip. They spent $43 and used their rewards, which is $4 off the price. Then, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since they had $4 in rewards, the coupon took $8 off the price.

To find the total discount, we add the rewards and the coupon discount: $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

Now, we subtract the total discount from the amount they spent on the current shopping trip: $43 (spent) - $12 (discount) = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total income for each job. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, so we multiply the hourly wage by the number of hours worked:

$15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year

Next, we need to calculate the income tax for each job. Job A has a 20% tax rate, so we multiply the total income by the tax rate:

$30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000

Now, we subtract the income tax from the total income to find the net income for Job A:

$30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B pays a total of $42,000 per year, but we also need to consider the property tax of $6,000. So, we subtract the property tax from the total income:

$42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000

Next, we calculate the income tax for Job B, which is 10% of the net income:

$36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600

Now, we subtract the income tax from the net income to find the final net income for Job B:

$36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of ruined castles in Scotland, we need to calculate 40% of the total number of castles. 

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we need to divide the number of ruined castles by 2.

88 / 2 = 44

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two offers from Furniture United and Cozy Homes. We need to find the total cost of each offer and then find the difference between them.

Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. To find the total cost, we need to add the advance payment and the total of the monthly installments. The total of the monthly installments is 6 * $350 = $2,100. So, the total cost of Furniture United's offer is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. To find the total cost, we need to add the advance payment and the total of the monthly installments. The total of the monthly installments is 9 * $250 = $2,250. So, the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two offers. To do this, we subtract the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer from the total cost of Furniture United's offer: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To find out how many guns each person would have if they were shared equally, we need to add up the total number of guns and then divide by the number of people.

Let's start by adding up the total number of guns:

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns.

Total number of guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

There are 4 people. To find out how many guns each person would have, we need to divide the total number of guns by the number of people.

24 ÷ 4 = 6

So, if they were to share their guns equally, each person would have 6 guns.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the amount of sugar required for 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

First, let's find the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers. Since each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar, we multiply 8 by 30 to get the total amount of sugar needed for the suckers.

8 x 30 = 240 ounces

Next, we need to find the amount of sugar required for 1 batch of fudge. Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar, so we don't need to multiply this number.

Now, we add the amount of sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge to get the total amount of sugar Mason needs.

240 ounces (for suckers) + 70 ounces (for fudge) = 310 ounces

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

First, we need to find the price of each share after the first year. The stock price increases by 50%, which means it's multiplied by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5 as a decimal). So, the price of each share after the first year is $8 * 1.5 = $12.

Next, we need to find the price of each share after the second year. The stock price decreases by 25%, which means it's multiplied by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 0.75 as a decimal). So, the price of each share after the second year is $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the price of each share after the second year by the total number of shares to find the total value of all shares: 8 * $9 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we need to first determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we need to subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a total of 200 students in a class, and they are divided into 3 groups. Two of the groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as x. Since the third group has 10 fewer students, the number of students in the third group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can write the equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Since the third group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the third group by subtracting 10 from x: 
70 - 10 = 60

So, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals on his farm, and they are all either chickens or cows. We also know that he has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's use the variables C for the number of cows and H for the number of chickens.

Since H = 2C, we can substitute H in the equation H + C = 60 with 2C, resulting in 2C + C = 60. This simplifies to 3C = 60.

To find the value of C, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in C = 60 / 3 = 20.

Now that we know C = 20, we can find the value of H by multiplying C by 2, resulting in H = 2 * 20 = 40.

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs of the chickens is 2 * 40 = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows is 4 * 20 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find out how many balls Josh has left to juggle, we need to determine how many balls he had initially and then subtract the number of balls he lost.

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term (a) is 3 and the common difference (d) is 1. The number of terms (n) is 4. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence to find the total number of balls Josh had initially:

S_n = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d)
S_4 = 4/2 * (2(3) + (4-1)1)
S_4 = 2 * (6 + 3)
S_4 = 2 * 9
S_4 = 18

So, Josh had 18 balls initially. However, he drops 3 balls, and 2 are caught by the crowd. This means he loses 1 ball.

To find the number of balls Josh has left, we subtract the number of balls lost from the initial number of balls:

18 - 1 = 17

However, this is incorrect since Josh started with 7 balls. Let's recalculate the initial number of balls Josh had. Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term (a) is 3 and the common difference (d) is 1. The number of terms (n) is 4. We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence to find the total number of balls Josh had initially:

a_n = a + (n-1)d
a_4 = 3 + (4-1)1
a_4 = 3 + 3
a_4 = 6

However, this is still incorrect. Let's try again. Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term (a) is 3 and the common difference (d) is 1. The number of terms (n) is 4. We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence to find the total number of balls Josh had initially:

a_n = a + (n-1)d
a_5 = 3 + (5-1)1
a_5 = 3 + 4
a_5 = 7

So, Josh had 7 balls initially. When he drops 3 balls, 2 are caught by the crowd, so he loses 1 ball.

To find the number of balls Josh has left, we subtract the number of balls lost from the initial number of balls:

7 - 1 = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we need to determine the weights of the other animals and then add them to the weight of the container.

Let's start by using the information given:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. Since the blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. Similarly, the green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of the animals and the container:
50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds

"To find the total number of outfits, we need to add the outfits Laurel received from her friend, the new outfits she got at the baby shower, and the outfits her mom gifted her.

First, we know Laurel's friend gave her 24 outfits. Then, she received twice that amount at the baby shower, which is 2 * 24 = 48 outfits. Finally, her mom gifted her 15 outfits.

To find the total number of outfits, we add these amounts together: 24 + 48 + 15 = 87.

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run. 

The original distance Tyson runs is 5000 meters. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. 

To find 1/5 of 5000 meters, we divide 5000 by 5. 

5000 ÷ 5 = 1000 meters.

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, the total distance covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180000"
"To find the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we need to first determine the prices of each.

Juice Box A costs 4 dollars. Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so we add 5 to 4 to get the price of Juice Box B: 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.

Next, we find the price of Juice Box C by adding 7 dollars to the price of Juice Box A: 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference between the price of Juice Box C and Juice Box B. We do this by subtracting the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total number of legs in the restaurant, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of table and add them together.

First, let's find the number of legs for the tables with 4 legs: 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

Next, we'll find the number of legs for the tables with 3 legs: 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, we add the number of legs from both types of tables: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The total number of legs in the restaurant is 310."
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies used by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in a bag.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies a week.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies a week.

The total number of cookies used by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 are used by her son and husband, Jenny eats the remaining cookies.

36 - 27 = 9

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, we need to calculate the discount first. The discount is 40% of the original price of $30.

Discount = 40% of $30

"To find the percentage increase in the amount the factory makes per day, we need to compare the new amount to the old amount. 

The factory used to make $1000 per day when they made tractors, and now they make $1100 per day. 

To find the difference, we subtract the old amount from the new amount: $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the old amount and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the total cost per month and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the cost of food per month: 
Food cost per week = $25
Number of weeks in a month = 4
Food cost per month = 25 × 4 = $100

Now, let's add the cost of treats and medicine to the food cost:
Total cost per month = Food cost per month + Treats cost per month + Medicine cost per month
Total cost per month = $100 + $20 + $100
Total cost per month = $220

Now, let's multiply the total cost per month by 12 to get the total cost per year:
Total cost per year = Total cost per month × 12
Total cost per year = $220 × 12
Total cost per year = $2,640

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs and subtract that from the number she already bought.

First, we know April needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. Since she also needs twice as many for the roses, we multiply 30 by 2 to find the number of plant pots needed for the roses: 2 * 30 = 60.

Now, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots she needs: 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April already bought 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of plant pots she needs from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

So, April has 10 plant pots left over.

"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to determine the amount of money she had after saving and then subtract that from the initial amount.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Andrea started with $36.
2. She spent $11 on a sweater, so she had $36 - $11 = $25 left.
3. She then gave her brother $4, so she had $25 - $4 = $21 left.

The amount Andrea had after saving is $21. To find out how much she saved, we need to subtract this amount from the initial amount.

Initial amount: $36
Amount after saving: $21

Amount saved = Initial amount - Amount after saving
Amount saved = $36 - $21
Amount saved = $15

"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to figure out the total time he spent on all his activities and then find 40% of that time.

First, let's calculate the time spent on boating and swimming. John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Next, we need to find the time spent watching shows. Since there were 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours, the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

Now, we add up the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We know that the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. Let's use this information to find the total time. We can set up an equation: 30% of the total time = 6 hours. To find the total time, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 30 / 100 = 0.30. Now we can solve for the total time: 0.30 * total time = 6, total time = 6 / 0.30, total time = 20 hours.

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time. We can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40 / 100 = 0.40. Now we can multiply the total time by this decimal to find the time spent sightseeing: 0.40 * 20 = 8 hours.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

First, let's calculate her earnings from her first job, where she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work:
$10/hour × 20 hours = $200

Next, we'll calculate her earnings from her second job, where she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work:
$5/hour × 15 hours = $75

Now, we add her earnings from both jobs to find her total earnings:
$200 + $75 = $275

Since Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, we subtract her total earnings from her savings to find out how much more she needs:
$80 - $275 = -$195

However, since we can't have a negative amount of money, this means Annabelle still needs to save more to reach her goal. To find out how much more she needs, we subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone:
$400 - $275 = $125

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $125 to buy the phone.

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and subtract it from her dad's budget.

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

Since Morgan will also be playing, we need to subtract her cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 
To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.83 ≈ 1

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the arcade tokens in the cost per friend. The cost per friend is actually $30 + $5 = $35. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $35 = 1.57

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.57 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $55 - $5 = $50. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$50 / $35 = 1.43

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.43 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the go-karts in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $50 - $20 = $30. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$30 / $35 = 0.86

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.86 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the mini-golf in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $30 - $5 = $25. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$25 / $35 = 0.71

"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate her daily savings and then multiply it by the number of days she saves.

First, let's find out how much she spends on lollipops each day. Since each lollipop costs $0.25, we can multiply this by the number of lollipops she buys, which is 4.

Cost of lollipops per day = 4 x $0.25
Cost of lollipops per day = $1

Now, we subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money to find out how much she saves each day.

Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Cost of lollipops
Daily savings = $5 - $1
Daily savings = $4

Since Marisa saves for 5 days, we multiply her daily savings by the number of days.

Total savings = Daily savings x Number of days
Total savings = $4 x 5
Total savings = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to follow a step-by-step process.

First, let's determine how much money Billy had left after buying the candy. He started with $10 and spent an unknown amount on candy. Let's call the amount of candy he bought 'x' pounds. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the total cost of the candy is $1.5x.

The amount of money Billy had left after buying the candy is $10 - $1.5x.

Next, he took half of this amount and spent it on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * $0.05 = $2.

Since he took half of his change, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of (10 - 1.5x), which is (10 - 1.5x) / 2.

We know that the amount he spent on gumballs is $2, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

So Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find Carver's son's age, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the son's age as 'x'. Since Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age, we can write the equation as:

2x - 5 = 45

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:

2x - 5 + 5 = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Next, divide both sides by 2 to find the value of 'x':

(2x) / 2 = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to know the total distance it travels in one day and the distance it needs to travel before needing service.

First, let's find the total distance the train travels in one trip. It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 125 miles from the third city to the first city (since 75 + 100 - 50 = 125). 

So, the total distance in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total distance between services by the total distance it travels in a day.

Number of days between services = Total distance between services / Total distance in a day
= 18,000 miles / 900 miles
= 20 days

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, we need to find the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The average is calculated by adding the two values and dividing by 2. 
Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 
Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time John took for the trip, we need to calculate the time it took to drive to his friend's house and the time it took to drive back home.

First, let's find the time it took to drive to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. We can use the formula Time = Distance / Speed to find the time.

Time = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.857 hours (rounded to three decimal places). However, we also need to consider the detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the total distance to his friend's house is 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles.

Time = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

Now, let's find the time it took to drive back home. The distance is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. We can use the same formula Time = Distance / Speed.

Time = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

To find the total time taken for the trip, we add the time it took to drive to his friend's house and the time it took to drive back home.

Total time = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to determine the number of boys present and subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, let's find the total number of students present on Friday. We know that 9 students were absent, so the number of students present is 96 - 9 = 87.

Next, we need to find the number of girls present. Since 43 girls were in the school and 5 were absent, the number of girls present is 43 - 5 = 38.

Now, we can find the number of boys present by subtracting the number of girls present from the total number of students present: 87 - 38 = 49.

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49.

The final answer is: 49"
"To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to determine the number of boys and add it to the number of girls. Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, and there are 6 girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2.

Number of boys = 2 * 6
Number of boys = 12

Now, we can find the total number of kids in the park by adding the number of boys and girls:

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 12 + 6
Total number of kids = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To pass to the next school year, Jane needs to score at least 42 points on her three tests. She's already scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. To find out the minimum number of points she needs on the third test, we can subtract the points she's already scored from the total required points.

Let's do the math:

Total required points = 42
Points scored in the first test = 15
Points scored in the second test = 18

Points scored so far = 15 + 18 = 33
Points needed on the third test = Total required points - Points scored so far
= 42 - 33
= 9

So, Jane needs to score at least 9 points on the third test to pass to the next school year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for not wearing masks. Then, 4 times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. So, we can calculate the number of shoplifters as follows:

4 * 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7

Now, we know that 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence. So, we can calculate the number of people kicked out for physical violence as follows:

3 * 7 = 21

We are given that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. We can set up an equation to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons:

3 (not wearing masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) + O (other reasons) = 50

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

31 + O = 50

Now, we can solve for O by subtracting 31 from both sides of the equation:

O = 50 - 31
O = 19

The final answer is: 19"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

We know that Erin has 14 points now and that she has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. 

To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to figure out how many points she had when she had three times more points than Sara. Let's call that number x. 

We know that x + 8 = 3 * 8, because Erin had three times more points than Sara. 

x + 8 = 24 

Now, we need to solve for x. To do that, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation. 

x = 24 - 8 
x = 16 

However, this is the number of points Erin had when she had three times more points than Sara. We want to find out how many points Erin had before she had 14 points. 

Let's call the number of points Erin had before y. We know that y + 14 = 16, because Erin had 14 points after she had three times more points than Sara. 

y + 14 = 16 

Now, we need to solve for y. To do that, we subtract 14 from both sides of the equation. 

y = 16 - 14 
y = 2

"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's find the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and we need 44 frames. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 x $20 = $880.

Next, we need to add the cost of etching the logo on each frame. The etching costs 20% of the frame's cost, which is 0.20 x $20 = $4 per frame. So, the total cost of etching is 44 x $4 = $176.

Now, let's add the cost of the picture frames and the etching: $880 + $176 = $1056.

We also need to add the cost of the pins. Two seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 x $5 = $10.

Next, we need to find the cost of the cords. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, which is 1/4 x 44 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 x $12 = $132.

Finally, let's add the cost of the picture frames, etching, pins, and cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. 
20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold on Friday is 14 * 2 = 28.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs. So, the total number of shoes sold on Saturday is 28 * 2 = 56.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. The total shoes sold on Sunday is 14 * 2 - 12 = 16.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
28 (Friday) + 56 (Saturday) + 16 (Sunday) = 100.

First, we find the number of pupils who like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we can calculate this as 40 / 2 = 20.

Next, we find the number of pupils who like green. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5.

The total number of pupils who like blue and green is 20 + 5 = 25.

The number of pupils who like yellow is 40 - 25 = 15.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

First, let's find the number of apples picked on Monday. We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday and got $56 from selling them at $4 per piece. To find the number of apples, we can divide the total amount of money by the price per apple:

$$\frac{56}{4} = 14$$

So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we add the number of apples picked on each day to find the total:

14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed. 

First, let's find out how many socks are in the 10 pairs she washed. Since each pair has 2 socks, we multiply the number of pairs by 2: 10 x 2 = 20 socks.

Next, we add the 15 loose socks she washed to the total number of socks from the pairs: 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Now, we subtract the total number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks that need washing: 50 - 35 = 15

So, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to add the number of cookies she initially bought and the number of cookies Janet gave her, then subtract the number of cookies her brother ate.

Let's start by adding the initial number of cookies and the cookies Janet gave her: 23 + 42 = 65.

Now, we need to subtract the number of cookies her brother ate: 65 - 44 = 21.

So, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest first. The formula for interest is Principal * Rate * Time. 

The principal is $3,650, the rate is 10% or 0.10, and the time is 5 months. 

Total interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Total interest = $1,825

Now, we add the interest to the principal to get the total amount Karan has to pay: $3,650 + $1,825 = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months: $5,475 / 5 = $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, so Cho hiked 14 × 8 = 112 kilometers.

To find out how far Chloe hiked, we need to multiply Chloe's speed by the time. Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, so Chloe hiked 9 × 5 = 45 kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked than Chloe, we need to subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance. Cho hiked 112 kilometers and Chloe hiked 45 kilometers, so Cho hiked 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers farther.

The final answer is: 67"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

"To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 × 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 × $1 = $36.

The cost of the supplies is $18. So, the total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she can make 36 cups in total, she will spend 36 ÷ 4 = 9 hours selling all the lemonade.

The profit per hour is $18 ÷ 9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can set up the equation:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26 girls.

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find half of the number of girls. Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.

The total number of people performing is the number of girls minus the number of girls who couldn't make it, plus the number of teachers. So, the total number of people performing is 26 - 13 + 3 = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. 

First, we add up all the scores:

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the erasers and pencils together: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) × 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 × $2 = $4.

Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides, so the total cost for her is 9 × $4 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

Since they both ride all 9 rides, the cost for Dasha is $36 and the cost for David is $30.

The amount of money David saves is $36 - $30 = $6.

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we need to first determine the number of popsicles each person has. We know that the ratio of popsicles they have is 5:6 and the total number of popsicles is 165.

To find the number of popsicles each person has, we can use the ratio to set up an equation. Let's say Betty has 5x popsicles and Sam has 6x popsicles. Since the total number of popsicles is 165, we can write the equation:

5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms:
11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
Betty's popsicles = 5x = 5(15) = 75
Sam's popsicles = 6x = 6(15) = 90

To find the difference in the number of popsicles between Sam and Betty, we subtract the number of Betty's popsicles from Sam's popsicles:
Difference = Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles = 90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To find out how much money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services he's getting instead.

The cost of Netflix is $10 a month. Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but since Tim is bundling them, he gets a 20% discount. 

First, let's find 20% of $20 (the normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus). To do this, we multiply $20 by 0.2 (which is the decimal form of 20%).

20% of $20 = 0.2 * $20 = $4

Since Tim gets a 20% discount, we subtract the discount from the normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

$20 - $4 = $16

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $16. 

Now, we add the cost of Netflix to the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus to find the total cost of the streaming services.

$10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cable package cost to find out how much he saves.

$60 - $26 = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the percentage of time spent editing, we need to know the total time spent on the song and the time spent editing. 

Time spent writing: 4 hours
Time spent recording: 4 / 2 = 2 hours
Time spent editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Total time spent = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Now, let's find the percentage of time spent editing. We'll divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song."
"To find the total number of books Wendy wants to place, we need to calculate double the number of books in the shelving system and then add 20 to that number.

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books is 6 * 6 = 36.

Double the number of books is 2 * 36 = 72.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so she needs 72 + 20 = 92 books.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Let's start by calculating the total number of cards Erica initially had. She made 20 Valentine's cards to pass out. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each. So, the number of cards her dad brought is 2 * 15 = 30.

Now, let's add the cards Erica initially had to the cards her dad brought: 20 + 30 = 50.

Next, we need to subtract the cards she passed out. She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so the total number of cards she gave away is 24 + 5 = 29.

Now, let's subtract the cards she passed out from the total number of cards she had: 50 - 29 = 21.

Finally, we need to add the cards she received from family and friends. She received 17 cards, so the total number of cards she has now is 21 + 17 = 38.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices of pizza are left, we need to first calculate how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is $\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4$ slices. 
Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is $\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3$ slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away and ate is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

The number of slices left is 12 - 9 = 3.

Number of days = Cost of the bike / Amount earned per day
= $300 ÷ $10
= 30

So, Mark has to save his money for 30 days to buy the bike."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Let's start with the number of spiders: 90. The number of millipedes is 1/3rd of the number of spiders, so we can calculate it by dividing 90 by 3.

Number of millipedes = 90 / 3 = 30

Now, let's find the number of stink bugs. It's equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. We can write this as an equation:

Number of stink bugs = 2 × Number of millipedes - 12
= 2 × 30 - 12
= 60 - 12
= 48

Now that we have the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs, we can find the total number of bugs by adding them together:

Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
= 90 + 30 + 48
= 168

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages, we need to first determine their ages. We know that Erica is 30 years old.

Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Beth's age by adding 5 to Erica's age: 30 + 5 = 35.

Now, we know that Alice is 7 years older than Beth. To find Alice's age, we add 7 to Beth's age: 35 + 7 = 42.

The difference between Alice's and Erica's ages is 42 - 30 = 12.

"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a year.

First, let's find out how many days he works in a year. He works 4 weeks every month, and there are 12 months in a year. So, the total number of weeks he works in a year is 4 * 12 = 48 weeks. Since he works 6 days every week, the total number of days he works in a year is 48 * 6 = 288 days.

Now, let's find out his daily earnings. He gets paid $50 every day.

So, his total earnings in a year would be his daily earnings multiplied by the number of days he works in a year.
Total earnings = $50 * 288
Total earnings = $14400

"To find out how much energy Mel will save, we need to calculate the difference in energy usage between the original and the reduced usage.

First, let's find the original energy usage per day. Since the air conditioner uses 900 watts for 8 hours a day, we multiply 900 watts by 8 hours to get the total energy used in watt-hours (Wh). 

900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 Wh

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 Wh, we can convert 7200 Wh to kWh by dividing by 1000.

7200 Wh / 1000 = 7.2 kWh

Now, let's find the new energy usage per day. If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours, he uses it for 3 hours a day. We multiply 900 watts by 3 hours to get the new energy used in Wh.

900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh

Converting 2700 Wh to kWh, we get:

2700 Wh / 1000 = 2.7 kWh

Now, we subtract the new energy usage from the original energy usage to find the energy saved per day.

7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30.

4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh

"To make enough muffaletta sandwiches for 20 people, we need to figure out how many sandwiches to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need 5 pounds of each.

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese.

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Allan has twice as many corns as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, the number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he bought 60 - 40 = 20 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. This means he bought 60 - 20 = 40 corns.

Now, let's find the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house. We add the initial number of corns and cannolis to the number of corns and cannolis Allan bought:

Initial corns: 80
Initial cannolis: 40
Corns bought: 40
Cannolis bought: 60

Total corns: 80 + 40 = 120
Total cannolis: 40 + 60 = 100

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 120 + 100 = 220.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before his jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, before his jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete

However, since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the steps he had left to complete before his jog.

4,000 (steps left to complete) - 2,000 (steps left after jog) = 2,000 steps

"To figure out how many minutes early Toby will be at the airport, we need to calculate how long it will take him to read the book and then add the time it takes to get to the airport.

First, let's find out how many words are in the book. Since it's 45 pages long and each page has 200 words, we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page:

45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Now, we need to find out how long it will take Toby to read the book. He can read 300 words per minute, so we divide the total number of words by his reading rate:

9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so we add that to the time it takes to read the book:

30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, so we subtract the time he arrives from the time he has to be there:

60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total amount paid in May. The company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

Next, let's find the total amount paid in June. 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"To find the total amount spent on fireworks, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework, then apply the discount.

The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

To find the discount, we need to calculate 20% of $1200. This can be done by multiplying $1200 by 0.2, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent is $960 (fireworks) + $150 (finale firework) = $1110.

"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate how many cookies she will eat in 30 days and then divide that number by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she eats in 30 days, we multiply 2 by 30:
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs:
60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog, so we multiply 0.05 by 50,000. That's 0.05 * 50,000 = 2,500 candles.

Now, we need to find the number of candles that are more likely to explode. Since Marcy guarantees that 99% of her candles won't explode, that means 1% will. So, we multiply 0.01 by 50,000 to get the number of candles that are more likely to explode. That's 0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles.

However, we're only interested in the candles that both smell like wet dog and are more likely to explode. We know that 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog. To find this number, we multiply 0.05 by 500 (the number of candles that are more likely to explode). That's 0.05 * 500 = 25 candles.

The number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25."

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Next, Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

Since we don't know how many apples Joanne gathers from the average trees, let's call this number 'x'. The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.

The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.

We know that the combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation: 45 + x + 105 = 500.

Now, let's solve for x:
45 + x + 105 = 500
x + 150 = 500
x = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's solve this problem step by step. We have a herd with camels and dromedaries. We know that there are 180 heads and 304 bumps. Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can set up two equations based on this information.

Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We can write the first equation based on the total number of heads:

C + D = 180

We can also write the second equation based on the total number of bumps:

2C + D = 304

Now, we can solve this system of equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days. Since Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, we need to find the distance traveled in the next 2 days. It's given that he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. To find 30% of 800 km, we multiply 800 by 0.30 (since 30% is the same as 30/100 or 0.30):
(0.30) * 800 km = 240 km
So, the total distance traveled in the next 2 days is 240 km.

On the next day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from Peter's locker size. 

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Peter's locker size by 4 to find Zack's locker size. 

Let's denote Peter's locker size as P = 5 cubic inches. 
Zack's locker size = 4 * P = 4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2 to find Timothy's locker size. 

Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to determine the elevation of the comb first. 

Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and the comb fell 4,000 feet. To find the elevation of the comb, we subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation.

Elevation of the comb = Initial elevation - Distance fallen
Elevation of the comb = 10,000 - 4,000
Elevation of the comb = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb.

Distance Oliver must climb = Elevation of the comb - Oliver's elevation
Distance Oliver must climb = 6,000 - 3,000
Distance Oliver must climb = 3,000 feet

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the money he initially had to the money he received from the banks.

Let's start with the money he initially had: $5000.

The first bank gave him $4000, and the second bank gave him twice as much, which is 2 x $4000 = $8000.

So, the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from the banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Now, we add the initial capital to the amount he received from the banks: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and took away 5 cats each. To find the total number of cats taken away, we multiply the number of boats by the number of cats each boat took: 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we multiply 3/5 by 30: $\frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18$.

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different price periods and calculate the cost for each period.

First, let's find out how many months are in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so 2 years is 2 * 12 = 24 months.

The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.

The remaining months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months) were $14 a month, so the cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

We also know that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

Now, let's substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

To eliminate the fraction, we'll multiply both sides by 3: T - 6 + 2T = 18.

Next, we'll combine like terms: 3T - 6 = 18.

Adding 6 to both sides gives us: 3T = 24.

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us: T = 8.

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans: J = T - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2.

The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

First, let's find the capacity of the buses. There are 4 buses, and each bus can hold 60 employees. So, the total capacity of the buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.

Next, we'll find the capacity of the minibusses. There are 6 minibusses, and each can hold 30 employees. So, the total capacity of the minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.

Lastly, we'll find the capacity of the minivans. There are 10 minivans, and each can hold 15 employees. So, the total capacity of the minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

Let's start by finding the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders. Since each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, and the store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, the homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Since Lillian made 3 homemade bird feeders, the total number of birds attracted to these feeders is 3 * 30 = 90.

Next, we need to find the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders. Since each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, and Lillian bought 3 of them, the total number of birds attracted to these feeders is 3 * 20 = 60.

Now, we can find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day by adding the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders: 90 + 60 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which is $4. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 4 * 0.25 = 1. Then, we add this to the cost of the bagel: 4 + 1 = $5.

Next, let's find the cost of the cake. The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold. Since he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he needs to make $50 from selling the cards.

Since each card is sold for $1.5, we can calculate the number of cards he sold by dividing the amount he needs ($50) by the price per card ($1.5).

$$\frac{50}{1.5} = 33.33$$

Since we can't sell a fraction of a card, we round down to 33 cards.

However, Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's denote the total number of cards as x. Then, 2/3 * x = 33.

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

$$\frac{2}{3}x = 33$$
$$x = 33 * \frac{3}{2}$$
$$x = 49.5$$

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we round up to 50 cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to figure out how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since he prepared enough for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs, that's 18 guests with 2 hotdogs each. So, 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for these 18 guests. 

For the other half of the guests (also 18), he prepared 1 hotdog each, which is 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs. 

In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs were needed. 

Since there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs were not enough. This means 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to add up the cost of all the items and then subtract the discount.

First, let's add up the cost of the items:
- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so that's 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the items:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, we need to find 20% of $165.00, which is the discount. To do this, we multiply $165.00 by 0.20:
0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To determine how much more money Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to first find out how many dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter slew.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who slew 100 dragons. Three quarters of 100 is $\frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75$.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew $2 \times 75 = 150$ dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew $\frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30$ dragons.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we need to first figure out how much gas was in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can find the amount in one container by dividing 15 by 5.

15 ÷ 5 = 3 gallons

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, we multiply 3 gallons by 8 to find out how many pints are in 3 gallons.

3 × 8 = 24 pints

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we need to find 1/4 of 3 gallons. To do this, we multiply 3 by 1/4.

3 × 1/4 = 3/4

Now, we convert 3/4 gallons to pints by multiplying 3/4 by 8.

(3/4) × 8 = 6 pints

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candy bars George bought with the money he had left after buying 3 bags of chips.

First, let's find out how much money George spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents, 3 bags will cost 3 * 40 cents = $1.20.

Now, let's find out how much money George had left after buying the chips. He spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money. So, the amount of money he had left is 1% of $5, which is 0.01 * $5 = $0.01.

However, we know that George spent $1.20 on chips, so the amount of money he had left after buying the chips is $5 - $1.20 = $3.80.

Now, let's find out how many candy bars George bought. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is $3.80 / 0.75 = 5.0667.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 5 candy bars.

"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared with them. Since he kept 5 lollipops for himself, we subtract that from the total number of lollipops he had.

25 (total lollipops) - 5 (lollipops kept) = 20 lollipops shared

Now, we need to divide the shared lollipops by the number of friends he shared them with, which is 4.

20 lollipops ÷ 4 friends = 5 lollipops per friend

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to first determine how much cake was eaten by Rory and her mom. Since there are 8 equal pieces in total, we can divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces to find the weight of each piece.

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake ÷ Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces ÷ 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, we need to find the total weight of the cake they ate. 

Total weight eaten = 2 × Weight of each piece
Total weight eaten = 2 × 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

Now, we can find the weight of the remaining cake by subtracting the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

First, let's find the cost of the onions. Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, we need to find the cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, we can find the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings: $12.00 ÷ 6 = $2.00.

"To figure out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to find out how long it takes her to get to the theater and then add 5 minutes to it.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne. Since Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. 

Let's think about it this way: if Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette takes 16 minutes. If Bernadette leaves 5 minutes before Wayne, she will arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. But we want to know how much earlier she should leave than Wayne, not how much earlier she will arrive.

So, if Bernadette leaves 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, we need to find out how long it takes Wayne to get to the theater. Since Bernadette takes 16 minutes, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes, we can set up an equation to find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave.

Let x be the time in minutes that Bernadette should leave before Wayne. Then, x + 5 + 16 = 4. We are solving for x.

x + 21 = 4

Subtract 21 from both sides:

x = -17

Since you can't leave before you start, we need to find the time Bernadette needs to leave after Wayne. We can do this by adding 24 to x (since Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater).

x + 24 = -17 + 24
x = 7

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to first find the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since we need to work with feet, we'll convert the length from yards to feet.

1 yard = 3 feet
So, 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has

"To find the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to consider the temperature changes caused by the oven and the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 3 × 5 = 15 degrees.

Next, we need to calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, so for 30 minutes, it cools down 2 × 3 = 6 degrees.

Now, we can find the final temperature of the house by adding the initial temperature to the temperature increase due to the oven and subtracting the temperature decrease due to the open window: 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we need to figure out his total time for the triathlon first. 

Jon's times are: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

So, Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to swim and bike. 
- James' swim time is 10% faster than Jon's, so it is 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes.
- James' bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, so it is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to run. 
Total time for James: 180 minutes
Time for James to swim and bike: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes
Time for James to run: 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know that Movie C is 1.25 hours long. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, Movie C is 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes long.

Next, we're told that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.

Now, we know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide the length of Movie B by 4. So, Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes long.

"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance it runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:
There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and they were sold for $25 each. The revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The final answer is: $539"
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each and the four packets with 16 pieces each.

First, let's find the total number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each. We can do this by multiplying the number of packets (6) by the number of crayons in each packet (8). This can be represented as 6 × 8 = 48.

Next, we need to find the total number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each. We can do this by multiplying the number of packets (4) by the number of crayons in each packet (16). This can be represented as 4 × 16 = 64.

Now, we add the number of crayons in both types of packets to find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought: 48 + 64 = 112.

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that a super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra. If we buy a regular ticket for $12 and a soda for $3, the total cost is $15. If we buy the super ticket for $20 and save $2, the total cost is $18.

The difference between the two scenarios is $18 - $15 = $3. This $3 difference is the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket. Since the super ticket includes the popcorn for $1 extra, the regular price of the popcorn is $3 - $1 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase.

Let's say the original cost of filling one balloon is x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons is $900, we can set up the equation 20x = 900.

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: x = 900 ÷ 20 = 45.

This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65.

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. Multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by 170: 65 × 170 = $11,050.

The final answer is: $11,050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance1 = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles
Distance2 = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles
Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

The value of the rubies she received is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Since Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day, together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, to find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30:

8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. The volume of a rectangular prism, like a raised bed, is found by multiplying its length, width, and height.

The dimensions of each bed are 8 feet (length), 2 feet (width), and 2 feet (height). So, the volume of one bed is 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we need to find the number of green cards first. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

The total number of cards is the sum of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the number of fairies remaining, let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. Then, 20 minutes later, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means 25 fairies joined the group, making the total number of fairies 50 + 25 = 75.

After 10 more minutes, 30 fairies flew away. To find the number of fairies remaining, we need to subtract 30 from the total number of fairies: 75 - 30 = 45.

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to calculate the total number of puppies and the number of puppies with spots.

First, let's find the total number of puppies. Jennifer has 8 puppies and Brandon has 12 puppies, so the total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer has 3 puppies with spots and Brandon has 4 puppies with spots, so the total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

So, the percentage of puppies with spots is 35%."
"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed and divide it by the truck's capacity.

First, let's calculate the weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the weight of all the feed:

Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300
Total weight = 3400 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a month, we need to calculate the total value of the cans and bottles she recycles each week.

First, let's find the total value of the aluminum cans she recycles in a week. Since each can is worth 2 cents and she drinks 3 cans a week, the total value of the cans is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

Next, we'll find the total value of the plastic bottles she recycles in a week. Since each bottle is worth 3 cents and she drinks 5 bottles a week, the total value of the bottles is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Now, we add the value of the cans and bottles to find the total earnings per week: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4 to find the total earnings per month: 21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first determine how many plants Toni has. Since Frederick has 10 plants and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has:
Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much money Leila gave Ali. Since Leila gave him half of her $100, we can calculate this by dividing $100 by 2.

$100 ÷ 2 = $50

Now that we know Leila gave Ali $50, we can add this to the amount he already had, which is $21.

$21 + $50 = $71

So, Ali now has a total of $71.

"To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to calculate 1/5 of the cost of the pizza and add it to the cost of the pizza.

The cost of the pizza is $15. To find 1/5 of the cost, we multiply the cost by 1/5.

1/5 of the cost = (1/5) × $15
= $15 ÷ 5
= $3

Now, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man.

Total amount = Cost of the pizza + Tip
= $15 + $3
= $18

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she has and then divide that by the number of cards each student receives.

First, let's find the total number of basketball cards. Since Miss Maria has 6 decks with 25 cards in each deck, we multiply the number of decks by the number of cards in each deck: 6 * 25 = 150.

Next, we find the total number of baseball cards. She has 5 boxes with 40 cards in each box, so we multiply the number of boxes by the number of cards in each box: 5 * 40 = 200.

Now, we add the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards to get the overall number of cards: 150 + 200 = 350.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, we subtract that from the total number of cards to find out how many cards she gives to her students: 350 - 50 = 300.

Finally, we divide the number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student receives to find the number of students: 300 ÷ 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples for both of them and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate Becky's total cost. She bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. 

Becky's cost per apple: $0.45
Number of apples: 20
Total cost: 20 * $0.45 = $9.00
Discount: $1 = $0.01 (since $1 = 100 cents)
Becky's total cost: $9.00 - $0.01 = $8.99

Next, let's calculate Kelly's total cost. She bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10% discount.

Kelly's cost per apple: $0.50
Number of apples: 20
Total cost: 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
Discount: 10% of $10.00 = 0.1 * $10.00 = $1.00
Kelly's total cost: $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. 
Kelly's total cost - Becky's total cost: $9.00 - $8.99 = $0.01

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is 5 x 2 = 10 shoes. Now he has 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 x 2 = 30 shoes. Now he has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 x 2 = 60 shoes. Now he has 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, we subtract 180 from 300 to find out how many shoes he has left: 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to determine how many cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles she has. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, we can multiply the number of jars by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate.

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Now, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she needs to bake to have at least 48 cupcakes. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we can divide 48 by 12 to get the number of pans.

48 ÷ 12 = 4

So, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes."

"To find the number of pencils left at the end of the year, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we find the total number of pencils initially in the class. Since there are 30 students and each student started with 10 pencils, we multiply the number of students by the number of pencils each student had.

Total pencils initially = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

2. Next, we find the number of pencils used after two months. We know that 1/5 of the total pencils were used, so we multiply the total pencils by 1/5.

Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils

3. Now, we find the number of pencils remaining after two months by subtracting the number of pencils used from the total pencils initially.

Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils

4. Finally, we find the number of pencils left at the end of the year. We know that only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left, so we multiply the remaining pencils by 1/3.

Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have the opportunity to eat 5 cookies."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we need to first calculate the combined length of the remoras. Since the remoras are 6 inches long and there are 2 of them, we need to convert the length from inches to feet.

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet
Combined length of remoras = 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy.

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

"To find the total number of students at that grade level, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, which is equal to one-fourth of the total number of students.

We can set up the equation: (1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4 to isolate x:
x = 20 * 4
x = 80

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80."
"To find out how many days Jason has to walk in total, we need to multiply the number of weeks by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, we need to divide the total number of days by 4 to find out how many days he has to walk each week.

21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25

Since Jason can't walk a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 5 weeks. 

5 weeks * 4 days/week = 20 days

Now, we need to find out how many days he has to walk each day. To do this, we'll divide the total number of days by 5.

20 days / 5 = 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 20 days / 5 = 4

The answer is 4 days."
"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought in total.

Total amount spent = $300
Cost of each book = $15

Total number of books = $300 ÷ $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we need to divide the total number of books by 4.

Number of books each child got = Total number of books ÷ 4
Number of books each child got = 20 ÷ 4
Number of books each child got = 5

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle helps us count the total number of kids allergic to dairy, peanuts, or both, and then subtract that from the total number of kids in the class.

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts:
9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) = 15

However, since 3 kids are allergic to both, we've double-counted them. To correct this, we subtract the number of kids allergic to both from the sum:
15 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything:
32 (total kids) - 12 (allergic kids) = 20

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

First, let's find the cost of the plane tickets. Since there are two people, and each ticket costs $5000, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Next, we need to find the cost of the hotel. The normal price is $1500 per day, but it's 20% more expensive because it's a busy weekend. To find the new price, we multiply the normal price by 1.2 (which is the same as 100% + 20%). So, the new price is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip: $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

"To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we need to calculate three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. 

The weight of the 1959 penny is given as 48 grains. To find three-quarters of this weight, we can multiply 48 by 3/4.

(3/4) * 48 = (3 * 48) / 4
= 144 / 4
= 36

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Now, to find the combined weight of the two pennies, we simply add the weights of the 2010 penny and the 1959 penny.

Combined weight = weight of 2010 penny + weight of 1959 penny
= 36 + 48

"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to first find out how many oranges he ate. 

They picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and then divide by 5.

(2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24 oranges

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange.
24 oranges * $10/orange = $240

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day and then multiply it by the number of days.

Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day. So, each horse eats 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

For five days, the total amount of oats consumed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide the total amount of oats consumed by the number of pounds in a bag to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs. 

200 pounds / 50 pounds per bag = 4 bags

"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to calculate the total number of eggs that can fit on the 2 trays and subtract that from the total number of eggs he has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, so the total number of eggs that can fit on the trays is 24 eggs/tray * 2 trays = 48 eggs.

Jaime has 64 eggs, and 48 eggs can fit on the trays, so the number of eggs that won't fit is 64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount Sally spent, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8
Cost of family-size pizza: 3 × $8 = $24

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

Total amount spent: $8 + $24 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so she will get a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 1 pack of razors with the sale and the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 8 razors in 2 packs (2 packs * 4 razors per pack), we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: 44.67"
"To find out how many minutes Charisma walked in 5 days, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she walked each day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma walks 5 minutes every hour. Since she works 8 hours a day, we multiply the number of minutes she walks per hour by the number of hours she works in a day: 5 minutes/hour * 8 hours = 40 minutes/day.

Now, we need to multiply the number of minutes she walks in a day by the number of days she worked: 40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find Angela's current age, we need to first determine her age in four years. Since Brett is 14 years old now, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. This means that in four years, Angela's age will be 3 * 14 = 42 years old.

Now, to find Angela's current age, we need to subtract 4 from 42, which gives us 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the morning rides. Since Paul drives his car twice a day, and he does this for 14 days, we can multiply the number of days by the cost of each morning ride. The cost of each morning ride is $6, so the total cost of the morning rides is:

14 days * $6 per day = $84

Next, let's find the cost of the afternoon rides. Paul also drives his car twice a day, and he does this for 14 days. The cost of each afternoon ride is $2, so the total cost of the afternoon rides is:

14 days * $2 per day = $28

Now, we can add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides to find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car:

$84 + $28 = $112

The final answer is: $112"
"To find out how many Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have and then divide that by the number of oranges needed for one pie.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has a total of 5 x 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we can find the total number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by 3.

120 ÷ 3 = 40

So, Brianne and Ashley can make 40 Greek orange pies.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're trying to find out how many guests Mark needs to invite for the two venues to be equal in cost.

The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, plus $5 for each guest. So, the total cost for this venue is $200 + $5x, where x is the number of guests.

The second venue charges $25 per guest, and food is already included in the price. So, the total cost for this venue is $25x.

To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

We want to isolate x, so let's subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Now, let's divide both sides by 20:

200/20 = x

x = 10

So, Mark needs to invite 10 guests for the two venues to be equal in cost.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Lily, David, and Bodhi collected a total of 43 insects. We also know that Lily found 7 more insects than David, and David found half the number of insects that Bodhi found.

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2.

We can express the number of insects Lily found as B/2 + 7, since she found 7 more than David.

The total number of insects collected is the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi, which is given as 43. We can write the equation as:

B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: B + B = 2B, and 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the equation becomes:

2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the yards used by Mariah. Since she used 1/4 of a skein, we can multiply 1/4 by the total yards in a skein, which is 364 yards.

1/4 × 364 = 91 yards

Next, let's find the yards used by her grandma. Since she used 1/2 of a skein, we can multiply 1/2 by the total yards in a skein, which is 364 yards.

1/2 × 364 = 182 yards

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together to find the total yards used.

91 + 182 = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

First, let's find the total number of gifts for the friends who want 5 gifts each. Since there are 2 friends, we multiply 2 by 5 to get 2 × 5 = 10 gifts.

Next, we find the total number of gifts for the friends who want 2 gifts each. Since there are 3 friends, we multiply 3 by 2 to get 3 × 2 = 6 gifts.

Now, we add the number of gifts for both groups of friends: 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Finally, we add the 10 random gifts to get the total number of gifts Cherrie bought: 16 + 10 = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the length of the couch, we need to find the width of the rug first. 

The chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. 
So, the rug's width = chair's width + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. 
Twice the width of the rug = 2 * 8 = 16 feet.
The couch is 2 feet longer than this, so the couch's length = 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. Out of these, 2 packs are strawberry gum, 1 pack is grape gum, and 1 pack is green apple gum.

The cost of the grape gum is $2, and the cost of the green apple gum is half of that, which is $1.

Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x.

The total cost of the grape gum is $2, and the total cost of the green apple gum is $1. So, the total cost of all the gum is 2x + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2x.

We are given that the total cost is $7. We can set up the equation: 3 + 2x = 7.

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, 2x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2, x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar and then calculate how many of that type of wood he can buy with his budget.

Let's calculate the number of sticks per dollar for each type of wood. A 2 x 4 piece of wood gives 200 sticks and costs $4, so the number of sticks per dollar is 200 / 4 = 50.

A 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks and costs $6, so the number of sticks per dollar is 400 / 6 = 66.67 (round down to 66.67 since we can't buy a fraction of a piece of wood).

Since 66.67 is greater than 50, the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives the most sticks per dollar.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24 budget: 24 / 6 = 4.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces of wood will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to first find the total number of snowshoes needed. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00, so the total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet saves by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips in a week and then subtract that from the cost of the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips in a week is 2 * 5 = 10.

The cost of one bus trip is $2.20. To find the total weekly cost of bus trips, we multiply the cost of one trip by the number of trips in a week: $2.20 * 10 = $22.00.

Now, we need to find out how much she would save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20. To do this, we subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from the total weekly cost of bus trips: $22.00 - $20 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the farm has 30 cows. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

Next, we're told the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the total number of animals at the farm is 30 + 10 = 40.

The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so the total number of animals at the zoo is 60 + 20 = 80.

To find the total number of animals at both the farm and the zoo, we add the number of animals at the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. If Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can start by setting up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can write the equation as:

x + y = 4(x + y)

However, this equation is not necessary. We can simply use the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. This means that the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 1/4 of the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought.

The total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. So, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 1/4 of 16, which is:

(1/4) × 16 = 4

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To figure out how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day, we need to know how many days he has to lose the weight. Since his birthday is on July 19th and today is December 31st, we need to count the days between these two dates.

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (since it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Since Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 
105,000 / 171 ≈ 613.5 calories per day.

The final answer is: 614"
"To find out how much Gerald has left after working for a week and spending $100, we need to calculate his total earnings and then subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7 to get his total earnings for the week:
$30/day × 7 days = $210

Now, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings to find out how much he has left:
$210 - $100 = $110

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to calculate the total distance she will run and then multiply it by the amount of water she needs to drink per kilometer.

First, let's calculate the total distance Hannah will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we can multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap:

Distance = Number of laps * Distance per lap
Distance = 8 laps * 0.25 km/lap
Distance = 2 km

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink. We know she needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, so we can multiply the total distance by the amount of water per kilometer:

Water needed = Total distance * Water per kilometer
Water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km
Water needed = 120 ml

"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's find 20% of $500, which is the amount she spent on clothes. To do this, we multiply 0.2 by $500.

0.2 * $500 = $100

Now, we subtract this amount from the initial $500 to find the remaining money after buying clothes.

$500 - $100 = $400

Next, we need to find 25% of the remaining money, which is the amount she spent on CDs. To do this, we multiply 0.25 by $400.

0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, we subtract this amount from the remaining money after buying clothes to find the final amount Julie had left.

$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the cost of the lot is x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, the cost of the house is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's find the total cost. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. To find the total number of bags, we multiply the number of packs by the number of bags per pack: 8 packs * 5 bags/pack = 40 bags. Now, we multiply the total number of bags by the cost per bag: 40 bags * $4/bag = $160.

Next, we need to find the total revenue. Tara sold each bag for $8, so we multiply the total number of bags by the selling price per bag: 40 bags * $8/bag = $320.

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $320 - $160 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. To find the total amount of money he has, we need to add the money from both the $10 bills and the $20 bills.

Total money from $10 bills = 4 × $10 = $40
Total money from $20 bills = 6 × $20 = $120
Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

Now, Ali gives his sister half of the total money. To find half of the total money, we divide the total money by 2.

Half of the total money = $160 ÷ 2 = $80
Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

Next, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of the remaining money, we multiply the remaining money by 3/5.

3/5 of the remaining money = (3/5) × $80 = $48
Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of cookies.

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be used for the granola and snack mix. Since Heather divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of them will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Now, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies. The total number of cups of raisins is 27, and 9 cups will be used for the granola and snack mix. So, 27 - 9 = 18 cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide the number of cups of raisins left for the oatmeal cookies by 3/4 to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make.

To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. So, 18 ÷ (3/4) = 18 × (4/3) = 24.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then multiply it by the cost per kilowatt hour.

First, let's find the daily and weekly consumption before adding the device. Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Multiply this by 7 to get the weekly consumption: 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per hour.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt hour. Multiply the weekly consumption by the cost per kilowatt hour to get the weekly bill before adding the device: 84 * $1.50 = $126.

Now, let's find the daily and weekly consumption after adding the device. The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour. Add this to Ada's daily consumption: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. Multiply this by 7 to get the weekly consumption: 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts per hour.

Multiply the weekly consumption after adding the device by the cost per kilowatt hour to get the weekly bill: 98 * $1.50 = $147.

The difference in weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To solve this problem, we need to first figure out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day because 5 people can do the work 5 times faster than one person.

Since 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day, they can paint a whole house in 2 days. This is because if you double the amount of work (painting a whole house instead of half a house), it will take twice as long.

Now, we need to convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days is equal to 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can find the number of chairs she has by adding 2 to the number of sofas. So, Ophelia has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Now, we're told that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. To find the number of chairs Jenna has, we multiply the number of chairs Ophelia has by 3. That's 22 * 3 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we subtract 2 from the number of chairs she has to find the number of sofas. So, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs. Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has a total of 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture. Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has a total of 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of pieces of furniture Ophelia and Jenna have. That's 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: 172"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set for a total of $48. To find out how many more CDs he could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to first find out how much money he spent on the headphone set.

Money spent on the headphone set = Total money spent - Money spent on the CD
Money spent on the headphone set = $48 - $4
Money spent on the headphone set = $44

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

Number of CDs that could have been bought = Money spent on the headphone set / Cost of one CD
Number of CDs that could have been bought = $44 / $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = 11

Next, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set and the CD.

Number of CDs that could have been bought = Total money / Cost of one CD
Number of CDs that could have been bought = $48 / $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = 12

Now, let's find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = Number of CDs that could have been bought - Number of CDs that could have been bought
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = 11 - 1
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks where he spent 4 hours, the weeks where he spent 5 hours, and the week where he spent 6 hours.

First, let's find the total hours for the weeks where he spent 4 hours. There are 6 weeks where he spent 4 hours. 

6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

Next, we need to find the total hours for the weeks where he spent 5 hours. There are 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours.

2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

Then, we need to find the total hours for the week where he spent 6 hours. There is 1 week where he spent 6 hours.

1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add up the total hours: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Now, 3 times fewer passengers get on. This means 3 times the number of passengers who got off (21) is 63, but since we are looking for the number of passengers who get on, we need to subtract 63 from the number of passengers who got off, which is 21. However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. Instead, we should interpret ""3 times fewer"" as 63 fewer than the number of passengers who got off. So, 21 - 63 = -42 is incorrect.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jame will be 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. Let's find Jame's age in 8 years: 22 + 8 = 30 years. Twice Jame's age in 8 years is 2 * 30 = 60 years. So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age: 55 - 8 = 47 years.

To find the difference between Jame's current age and his cousin's current age, we subtract: 22 - 47 = -25.

Since age can't be negative, we take the absolute value of the difference: | -25 | = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for a total of $2,400. The computer cost $1,100, and the printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, we need to find the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:
Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
= $1,100 - $400
= $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer, which is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. To find the cost of the 2 monitors, we subtract this amount from the total cost:
Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer and printer
= $2,400 - $1,800
= $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we need to find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the monitors by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
= $600 / 2
= $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 10 boys and each brought 60 shells, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

2. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells more than the boys.

3. To find the total number of seashells brought by the girls, we add the additional seashells to the total number of seashells brought by the boys: 600 + 300 = 900.

4. Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by 10 to find the number of seashells brought by each girl: 900 / 10 = 90.

Therefore, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that Nick had twice as many candies as George. If we let the number of candies George had initially be x, then Nick had 2x candies initially.

Now, George ate 5 candies, so he has x - 5 candies left. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 3

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 3 + 5
x = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find out how many candies Nick had initially. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x candies initially:

2x = 2(8)
2x = 16

So, Nick has 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we need to determine Alyana's age first. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, we can calculate Alyana's age by subtracting 4 from Chenny's age.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we can find Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick. 
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make.

Let's start by adding up the vlogs she has made so far:

Vlogs made in the first week: 18
Vlogs made in the second week: 21
Vlogs made in the third week: 15
Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Now, we subtract the total vlogs made from the total vlogs Emma aims to make:
72 - 54 = 18

Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total amount you paid, first, you need to calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 is the same as 0.20 * $50. To do this, you multiply 0.20 by 50.

0.20 * 50 = $10

Then, add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount you paid.

$50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

So, you ended up paying $60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we can divide $18 by 3 to find his initial share:

$$\frac{18}{3} = 6$$

So, the eldest boy initially received $6.

Next, he added $5 to his share, so he had $6 + $5 = $11.

Then, he added another $10, so he had $11 + $10 = $21.

After that, he spent $8, so he had $21 - $8 = $13.

Finally, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8, so he had $13 * 3 = $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much Elvis has to save each day in the second half of the month to reach his target of $1125.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Since April has 30 days, the first half of the month has 15 days (half of 30).
2. Let's say Elvis saves x dollars each day in the first half. Then, he will save 2x dollars each day in the second half, since he wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half.
3. The total amount saved in the first half is 15x dollars.
4. The total amount saved in the second half is 15(2x) = 30x dollars.
5. The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is 15x + 30x = 45x.
6. Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so we can set up the equation: 45x = 1125.
7. To find x, we divide both sides by 45: x = 1125 / 45 = 25.
8. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the amount saved in the second half is 2x = 2(25) = 50 dollars per day.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 × $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 × $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 × $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them will get and then find the difference.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and he finished 20 tasks. We can multiply the amount he gets per task by the number of tasks he completed to find his total.

Jairus' total = 0.8 * 20 = $16

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she finished 20 tasks. We can multiply the amount she gets per task by the number of tasks she completed to find her total.

Jenny's total = 0.5 * 20 = $10

Now, we need to find the difference between Jairus' total and Jenny's total.

Difference = Jairus' total - Jenny's total = 16 - 10 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Jeff and Brad are dividing 100 dollars between them, and Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

So, Jeff gets $80."
"To find out how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Now, we need to multiply the miles he walks each day by the number of days he works in a week. Jeff works 5 days a week, so the total miles he walks in a week is 6 * 5 = 30 miles.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, let's break it down step by step.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes 13 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes the 52 letters she wrote initially, and the 13 letters she wrote next. So, she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Now, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. So, the total number of letters she has written is 65 + 65 = 130.

The final answer is: 130"
"To find the number of families notified in the fourth round, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. This is a classic example of exponential growth, where each round multiplies the previous number of families by 3.

Let's break it down step by step:

- In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
- In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 * 3 = 9 families are notified.
- In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 * 3 = 27 families are notified.
- In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 * 3 = 81 families are notified.

The final answer is: 81"
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to figure out how much weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so we multiply the weight he lost per month by the number of months:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we add the total weight lost to his final weight to find his initial weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the larger play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys and the larger play set is five times larger, we multiply 80 by 5.

80 × 5 = 400

Now, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. Let's call the number of toys Jonathan currently has ""x"". We can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The final answer is: 398"
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item first.

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 × $1.50 = $7.50.

The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 × $0.25 = $0.50.

The cost of 1 calculator at $12 each is $12.

The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 each is $10.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, we need to find 10% of $30. This is 0.1 × $30 = $3.

To find the total cost after the discount, we subtract the discount from the original total: $30 - $3 = $27.

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its price and add them together.

5 hamburgers at $4 each: 5 x 4 = $20
10 packs of potato fries at $0.30 each: 10 x 0.30 = $3
5 cans of fruit drinks at $2 each: 5 x 2 = $10

Total cost: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

Carly pays with a $50 bill. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill.

Change = $50 - $33 = $17

The final answer is: $17"
"To find out how much Antonella earned, we need to calculate her commission. The company pays a 30% commission on the first $1000 of sales, and an additional 10% commission on sales over $1000.

First, let's find the commission for the first $1000: 30% of $1000 is 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

Next, we need to find the commission for the sales over $1000. Antonella sold goods worth $2500, so the sales over $1000 are $2500 - $1000 = $1500. The additional commission for these sales is 10% of $1500, which is 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

Now, we add the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the sales over $1000: $300 + $150 = $450.

The total amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"To figure out how many water bottles Bill needs to buy for his party, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he needs and subtract the number of bottles he already has.

First, let's find out how many bottles Bill has. He has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he has is 2 x 24 = 48.

Next, we need to find out how many bottles Bill needs for his guests. He has 70 guests, and he wants 2 bottles for each guest. So, the total number of bottles he needs for his guests is 70 x 2 = 140.

Now, we need to find the total number of bottles Bill needs. This is the sum of the bottles he already has and the bottles he needs for his guests. So, the total number of bottles he needs is 140 (for guests) + 48 (he already has) = 188.

Since Bill already has 48 bottles, he needs to buy 188 - 48 = 140 additional bottles.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how long Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we need to calculate the time it takes him to swim a mile in both conditions and then multiply it by 3.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long. So, we can calculate the time it takes him to swim a mile on a hot day as follows:

Time to swim a mile on a hot day = 2 * Time to swim a mile on a cold day + 2
= 2 * 16 + 2
= 32 + 2
= 34 minutes

Now, we can find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day.

Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day = 3 * Time to swim a mile on a cold day
= 3 * 16
= 48 minutes

Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day = 3 * Time to swim a mile on a hot day
= 3 * 34
= 102 minutes

Now, we can find the difference in time between the two days.

Difference in time = Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day - Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day
= 102 - 48
= 54 minutes

The final answer is: 54"
"To figure out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to know how much he earns in a week. We know he gets paid $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are $2 * 5 = $10.

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are $10 * 4 = $40.

Now, we can divide the target savings by his weekly earnings to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80:
$80 ÷ $40/week = 2 weeks

The final answer is: 2"

"To find the total number of holes in the bag of buttons, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes.

There are 7 buttons with 2 holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 × 2 = 14.

There are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons with 4 holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 14 × 4 = 56.

The total number of holes in all the buttons is 14 + 56 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to find the size of Zack's locker first, and then find half of that size.

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate Zack's locker size by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2. Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, so Zack's locker is 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches.

Now, we need to find Peter's locker size, which is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To do this, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4 or divide it by 4. So, Peter's locker is 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and her husband Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks. We also know that Juan's doctor wants him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.

Let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is x. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, she drinks x/2 cups of coffee. Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks, so he drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

We are given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. So, x = 4.

Now, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake:
Juan drinks 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups of coffee.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of hamsters: 3 cages * 10 hamsters per cage = 3 × 10 = 30 hamsters.

Next, we'll find the number of guinea pigs: 3 cages * 5 guinea pigs per cage = 3 × 5 = 15 guinea pigs.

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together: 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 30 + 15 = 45 rodents.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the average weight of the 3 friends, we need to find their total weight and divide it by 3.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. To find Bob's weight, we need to find twice Susan's weight, which is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we add up the weights of all three friends: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by 3: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

The average weight of the 3 friends is 180 pounds.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the final angle from the ground to the sun, we need to add the initial angle of the pyramid (32 degrees) to the angle the sun moves (5 degrees per hour) multiplied by the number of hours it moves (10 hours).

The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, so we need to add the angle it moves to the initial angle of the pyramid. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour, and it moves for 10 hours. 

Angle moved by the sun = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours
= 5 * 10
= 50 degrees

Now, we add the initial angle of the pyramid to the angle moved by the sun:
Final angle from the ground to the sun = Initial angle + Angle moved by the sun
= 32 degrees + 50 degrees
= 82 degrees

The final answer is: 82"
"To find out how much James spends on candles, we need to determine the total number of candles he needs. Since one son is 12 and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are one per year of age, so James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

The cost of 4 packs of candles is 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the total pages she read in both weeks.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 ÷ 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, in two weeks, Judy read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To find Shiloh's nephew's age, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's age today as x.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old. At the same time, his nephew will be x + 7 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be expressed as an equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: 51 / 3 = x + 7.

This simplifies to 17 = x + 7. Next, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 17 - 7 = x.

This simplifies to x = 10.

First, the tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth. 

Next, for the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, so the total is 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, the total for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we need to determine the number of goals scored by each of them. 

Let's start by using the information that Richie scored 80 goals. We know that he scored 20 more goals than Mark, so Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals. 

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

Now, let's add up the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

"To find the total cost of the kitten, we need to add up the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since there are 3 vaccines and each one costs $20, we multiply the number of vaccines by the cost per vaccine: 3 * $20 = $60.

Next, we need to find the cost of the broken vases. There are 4 vases that cost $12 each, so we multiply the number of vases by the cost per vase: 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (spaying the kitten) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (broken vases) = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

First, let's find the total number of roses ordered per week: 
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is: 
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is: 
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

"To find the net profit of the food truck, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

First, let's find the total cost. The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread. The cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they need 1 set of cheese and condiments.

Total cost = cost of bread + cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

Next, let's find the total revenue. They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.

Total revenue = number of sandwiches * price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

"To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and the cost of the materials and labor.

First, we find the area of the bedroom by multiplying the length and width. The length is 18 feet and the width is 12 feet, so the area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

Now, we need to find the cost of the new carpet, the padding, and the labor.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

To find the total cost of the materials, we add the cost of the carpet, the padding, and the old carpet removal: $2592 + $432 + $864 = $3888.

To find the total cost of the labor, we add the cost of removing the old carpet and installing the new carpet: $864 + $7344 = $8208.

The total cost to replace the carpet is the sum of the total cost of the materials and the total cost of the labor: $3888 + $8208 = $12196.

- Days 1-2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4-5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Now, let's add up the total number of birds Mack saw over the week:
50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280

Since there are 7 days in a week, we'll divide the total number of birds by 7 to find the average:
280 ÷ 7 = 40

So, Mack saw an average of 40 birds per day over the week."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given operations step by step.

First, we start with the given value of 20. 

Next, we find half of this value, which is 20 / 2 = 10.

Then, we add the starting value to half the number, which gives us 20 + 10 = 30.

After that, we divide the resulting value by 5, so 30 / 5 = 6.

Finally, we multiply the resulting value by the starting value minus 12, which is 20 - 12 = 8. So, 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards they have together, we need to find the number of cards each of them has and add them together.

"To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to, we need to figure out how much higher the actual temperature is than the set temperature. The oven is set to 450, but it's actually at 468. 

First, let's find the difference between the actual and set temperatures: 468 - 450 = 18.

Now, we need to find out what percentage 18 is of 450. To do this, we'll divide 18 by 450 and multiply by 100: (18 ÷ 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4%, we need to find 4% of 520 (the temperature the recipe calls for). To do this, we'll multiply 520 by 0.04: 520 * 0.04 = 20.8.

Now, we'll add 20.8 to 520 to find the actual temperature: 520 + 20.8 = 540.8.

Since Maggie can't set the oven to a fraction of a degree, we'll round to the nearest whole number. However, we're looking for the temperature she should set the oven to, not the actual temperature. To find this, we'll subtract 20.8 from 520: 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the temperature Maggie should set the oven to is 499.

The final answer is: 499"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

First, let's convert the time of the first movie into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1 hour to 60 minutes. Adding 30 minutes to that gives us 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for the first movie.

Next, let's convert the time of the second movie into minutes. We can convert 2 hours to minutes by multiplying 2 by 60, which gives us 120 minutes. Adding 5 minutes to that gives us 120 + 5 = 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we add the time for both movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price.

Herb's house price is $76,000. To find 30% of this, we multiply it by 0.3.

0.3 × $76,000 = $22,800

Now, we subtract this from Herb's house price to find Juan's house price.

Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
= $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

To find the combined value of the two houses, we add Herb's house price and Juan's house price.

Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
= $76,000 + $53,200
= $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To find the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend, we need to calculate the number of cups and dishes each of them brought and then add them together.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes Judy brought: 
Judy's cups: 12
Judy's dishes: 24
Total Judy brought: 12 + 24 = 36

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes her friend brought: 
Friend's cups: 40
Friend's dishes: 44
Total friend brought: 40 + 44 = 84

Now, let's add the total number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend: 
Total Judy brought: 36
Total friend brought: 84
Total brought by both: 36 + 84 = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we need to first find the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will have, and then the total cost of the contacts.

Since 90 single use contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of pairs of contacts he uses per day:
90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have a total of:
2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts

The total number of days the contacts will last is:
180 contacts / 2 contacts/day = 90 days

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, he will use a total of 180 contacts.

The cost of 2 boxes with a 10% discount is:
2 boxes * $100/box = $200
10% discount = $200 * 0.10 = $20
$200 - $20 = $180

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts:
$180 / 180 pairs = $1 per pair

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings and then find the difference.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours × $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 × 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 × 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours × $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we need to calculate the total calories she burned from aerobics and running.

Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour, and she did it for 2 hours, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

Running burns 600 calories per hour, and she did it for 1 hour, so the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

Now, we add the calories burned from aerobics and running to get the total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units there are: 1600 ÷ 200 = 8.

Since each 200-calorie unit requires 100 ml of water, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100: 8 * 100 = 800.

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500. We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.

Let's use the variable B to represent the number of blue jelly beans. Then, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B (since it's 1% fewer than blue jelly beans), and the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B (since it's 1% more than blue jelly beans).

We can write an equation to represent the total number of jelly beans:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3.01B = 4500

Now, divide both sides by 3.01:

B = 4500 / 3.01
B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average of Jared's typing speed measurements, we need to add up all the measurements and divide by 3.

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 words per minute (WPM).
His second typing speed is 52 WPM.
His third typing speed is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, let's add up all the measurements: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 ÷ 3 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the difference in weight between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then subtract the weight gained from the weight lost.

Weight lost per week: $-1.25$ pounds
Weight gained per week: $1.75$ pounds

Weight change after 5 weeks:
$-1.25$ pounds/week $\times 5$ weeks $= -6.25$ pounds (lost)
$1.75$ pounds/week $\times 5$ weeks $= 8.75$ pounds (gained)

Difference in weight: $8.75$ pounds $- (-6.25$ pounds) $= 8.75 + 6.25 = 15$ pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To find the total number of people attending the event, we need to break it down step by step.

First, Alex invites 100 people via email. Each of these people will bring 2 friends, so we multiply 100 by 2 to get 200. Then we add the 100 people who were invited in the first place, which gives us 300 people.

Next, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them say they will bring their spouses. This means 18 more people will be attending. We add these to the previous total of 300, which gives us 318.

But we still need to account for Alex herself. Since she's also attending, we add 1 to the total, making it 319.

So, Alex will need 319 seats for the event.

The final answer is: 319"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first, then multiply it by 44.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both Amazon and eBay.

The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16, and the shipping cost is $4. So, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

The cost of the boots on eBay is $13, and the shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles in height every day.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk for each day:

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. If we let 'x' represent Jerry's current age, we can write the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

To solve for 'x', we need to expand the equation:

x = 2x - 10

Next, we'll subtract 'x' from both sides to get:

-x = -10

Now, we'll divide both sides by -1 to isolate 'x':

x = 10

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we simply add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To figure out how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we need to know how much he still owes and how much he makes per hour.

First, let's find out how much he still owes. The base price of each implant is $2000, and he needs 2 implants, so that's 2 x $2000 = $4000. He also wants a crown for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600, so we need to subtract that from the total cost to find out how much he still owes: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we know George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the amount he still owes by his hourly wage: $3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, let's start by using the fact that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. We can represent the smallest angle as x.

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it is 3x.

We can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the coins into cents: 
8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: 
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

The final answer is: 69"
"To find the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of legs for the dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, we multiply the number of dogs by 4: 5 dogs x 4 legs/dog = 20 legs.

Next, we calculate the number of legs for the cats. Each cat also has 4 legs, so we multiply the number of cats by 4: 2 cats x 4 legs/cat = 8 legs.

Finally, we calculate the number of legs for the birds. Since each bird has 2 legs, we multiply the number of birds by 2: 10 birds x 2 legs/bird = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds and add it to 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds.

Adding 4 pounds to 8 pounds gives us 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since Jamaal then uses a weight two pounds lighter than this, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he gets each year and add them up.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 12 = 22 games in the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 5 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 24 = 29 games in the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 5 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 48 = 53 games in the third year.

"To find out how long it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles, we need to know its speed. We can find the speed by dividing the distance it traveled by the time it took.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Now that we know the plane's speed, we can use it to find the time it would take to travel 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. 
So, in 1 hour, Ruiz makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds of chocolates.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. 
So, Marissa makes (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates they make together in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds of chocolates in an hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates.
Marissa makes 45 pounds of chocolates in an hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. On Monday, Howard spent $8 at the arcade.
2. On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16.
3. On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 * $16 = $64.

Now, let's add up the total amount he spent: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

To find out how much he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount:
$100 - $88 = $12.

So, Howard has $12 left."
"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we need to calculate the total number of cups sold and the total amount earned from each period, then add them together.

First, let's find the total amount earned from the first four hours. Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. We can multiply the number of cups sold per hour by the number of hours to find the total number of cups sold, then multiply that by the price per cup.

Total cups sold in 4 hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
Total amount earned in 4 hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

Next, let's find the total amount earned from the next two hours. Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup. We can multiply the number of cups sold per hour by the number of hours to find the total number of cups sold, then multiply that by the price per cup.

Total cups sold in 2 hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total amount earned in 2 hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Now, we can add the total amount earned from both periods to find the total amount earned in 6 hours.

Total amount earned in 6 hours = $30 + $12 = $42

"To figure out how long the tires will last, we need to know how many times they rotate in a month and how many times they can rotate before they need to be replaced.

First, let's find out how many times the tires rotate in a month. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, and the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles. So, we multiply the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per 2 miles.

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/2 miles
Rotations per month = 400 * 725 / 2
Rotations per month = 290,000 rotations/month

Now, we need to find out how many months the tires can last before they need to be replaced. We know the tires can rotate 10,440,000 times before they need to be replaced.

Months before replacement = Total rotations allowed / Rotations per month
Months before replacement = 10,440,000 / 290,000
Months before replacement = 36

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the number of years by dividing the total months by 12.

Years before replacement = Months before replacement / 12
Years before replacement = 36 / 12
Years before replacement = 3

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and subtract it from the amount he has.

First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt: 
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt:
Discounted price of the shirt = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
Total cost = Discounted price of the shirt + Price of the shorts
Total cost = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we don't need to calculate it separately. Now, let's subtract the total cost from the amount Joe has:
Amount left = $50 - $52.50 = -$2.50

Since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Joe does not have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: -$2.50"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan needs to make croissants, we need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make and then multiply it by the amount of butter needed per dozen.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of croissants is:
4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, the total number of croissants is:
28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter per dozen:
336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

"So, John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. But his research takes 10 times longer than expected, which means it takes 5 * 10 = 50 months in total.

The first 5 months cost $100,000. For the remaining 45 months, the funding is 50% more than the initial funding. To find 50% of $100,000, I'll multiply it by 0.5: $100,000 * 0.5 = $50,000. Then, I'll add that to the initial funding to get the increased funding: $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000 per month.

Now, I'll multiply the increased funding by the number of months: $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

To find the total cost, I'll add the cost of the first 5 months to the cost of the remaining 45 months: $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water used in a year and then multiply it by the cost of a gallon of water.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so he does laundry 52 times in a year (since there are 52 weeks in a year). Since he does laundry twice a week, we multiply 52 by 2 to get the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year: 52 * 2 = 104.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

The cost of a gallon of water is $0.15, so the total cost of water used in a year is 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

"To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to calculate its height at the end of each week and add the growth.

At the end of the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall. This is our initial height.

At the end of the second week, it doubled in height, so we multiply the initial height by 2: 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

At the end of the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so we add this growth to the height at the end of the second week: 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

Therefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat he sells in a day and then divide the total weight of the bull's meat by that amount.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so he sells 15 * 10 = 150kg of meat per day.

The bull weighs 750kg. To find out how many days it will take to sell the meat, we divide the total weight of the bull's meat by the amount of meat Prince sells per day: 750 / 150 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know that there are 4 rows of seats with 18 seats in each row. So, the total number of seats in the auditorium is:

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 4 × 18 = 72 seats

Now, we are told that one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. To find the number of seats occupied by the administrators, we can multiply the total number of seats by 1/4:

Administrators = 1/4 × 72 = 18 seats

Next, we need to find the number of remaining seats after the administrators have occupied their seats. This can be done by subtracting the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats:

Remaining seats = Total seats - Administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

Now, we are told that one-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. To find the number of seats occupied by the parents, we can multiply the remaining seats by 1/3:

Parents = 1/3 × 54 = 18 seats

Finally, we can find the number of students by subtracting the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:

Students = Remaining seats - Parents = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to first find the total number of street lights and then subtract the number of non-functioning lights.

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Since there are 4 intersections, we multiply the number of poles at each intersection by the number of intersections to get the total number of poles: 6 * 4 = 24 poles.

Now, we multiply the total number of poles by the number of street lights per pole to get the total number of street lights: 24 * 4 = 96 street lights.

However, we know that 20 street lights are not functioning. To find the total number of functioning lights, we subtract the number of non-functioning lights from the total number of lights: 96 - 20 = 76.

The final answer is: 76"
"To find out how many times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to know how many times each one can be played and how many times they've already been played.

DVD 1 has been played 356 times and can be played 1000 times. To find out how many times it has left, we subtract the number of times it's been played from the total number of times it can be played: 1000 - 356 = 644.

DVD 2 has been played 135 times and can be played 1000 times. To find out how many times it has left, we subtract the number of times it's been played from the total number of times it can be played: 1000 - 135 = 865.

Now, we add the remaining times for both DVDs: 644 + 865 = 1509.

The final answer is: 1509"
"So John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, and he went twice a week for 2 hours each time. To find out how much it cost, we need to figure out how many hours he went to physical therapy in total.

First, let's find out how many sessions he went to. Since he went twice a week for 6 weeks, that's 2 sessions/week * 6 weeks = 12 sessions.

Now, we know he went for 2 hours each time, so we multiply the number of sessions by the number of hours per session: 12 sessions * 2 hours/session = 24 hours.

The cost per hour is $125, so we multiply the total hours by the cost per hour to get the total cost: 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000.

The final answer is: $3000"
"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim chews at school, we need to divide the total school hours by 2, since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. 

8 hours / 2 = 4 pieces of gum

He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces. 
Total pieces chewed so far: 4 + 2 = 6

He has 20 pieces initially, so we subtract the pieces he's already chewed: 
20 - 6 = 14

He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so we need to divide 14 by 2: 
14 / 2 = 7

Jim's sister takes 7 pieces, so we subtract that from the remaining gum: 
14 - 7 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we need to determine her current age. Since she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can calculate her current age by subtracting 12 from 16.

16 - 12 = 4

This means Charmaine is currently 4 years old. To find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we add 4 to her current age.

4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent by the baseball coach. He bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent is 9 x $3 = $27.

Next, let's calculate the total amount spent by the basketball coach. He bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent is 8 x $14 = $112.

Now, let's find the difference between the two amounts:
$112 - $27 = $85

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find the total number of flowers that have bloomed, we need to first find the total number of flowers in the garden. 

There are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row, so the total number of flowers is 10 * 20 = 200.

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we need to multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5.

4/5 * 200 = (4 * 200) / 5 = 800 / 5 = 160

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s and then to Mb/hour.

First, we know that 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb. So, to convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s, we divide 20 by 1000.

20 kb/s ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb/s to Mb/hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply 0.02 Mb/s by 3600 s/h.

0.02 Mb/s × 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb/h.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately and then add them together.

The number of cars towed on the first three days is 10 * 3 = 30.

The number of cars towed on the remaining days is 7 - 3 = 4 days. Since 4 fewer cars were towed on each of these days, the number of cars towed on each of these days is 10 - 4 = 6. So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is 6 * 4 = 24.

The total number of cars towed that week is 30 + 24 = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between his current height and the required height, and then divide that by his growth rate.

First, let's convert the required height from feet to inches, since Adam's height is given in inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so:

4 feet = 4 x 12 = 48 inches

Now, we can find the difference between Adam's current height and the required height:

48 inches (required height) - 40 inches (Adam's current height) = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference in height by his growth rate to find the number of years it will take for him to reach the required height:

8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down James' earnings step by step.

First, we need to find out how much James sold the cars for. Since he sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, we multiply the number of cars by the price per car: 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.

Next, we need to find out how much the company paid for the cars. They paid 30% of the total cost, which is 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000.

Now, we need to find the profit from selling the cars. We subtract the company's cost from the total selling price: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, we need to find out how much James made. He gets a 10% commission on the profit, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

James made $17,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to follow these steps:

First, we need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25:
100 × 0.25 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply 25 by 0.6:
25 × 0.6 = 15

Now, we need to find the number of men who can stay upright. Since there are 25 riders in total who can stay upright and 15 of them are women, the number of men who can stay upright is:
25 - 15 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

We know that the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000. The price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell. To find the price of the gold Jewell, we multiply the price of the diamond Jewell by 4/5.

Price of gold Jewell = (4/5) × $2000
= $1600

Now, we know that the cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold. To find the price of the silver Jewell, we subtract $400 from the price of the gold Jewell.

Price of silver Jewell = Price of gold Jewell - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = Price of diamond Jewell + Price of gold Jewell + Price of silver Jewell
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to determine the number of truck and rose stamps. 

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. Since he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, we can calculate the number of truck stamps by adding 3 to the number of snowflake stamps: 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

Next, we need to find the number of rose stamps. Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so we subtract 9 from the number of truck stamps: 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps to find the total number of stamps Max bought: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to know the speed of both of them and the distance between them. 

Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, and they are driving at different speeds. Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour.

The relative speed is the difference between their speeds, which is 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph. This is the speed at which Tom is closing the gap between them.

To find the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob, we use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative Speed.

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch by subtracting 6 from Naomi's total.

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can add 3 to Darren's total.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's say Manny attends x classes at $6 per class and y classes at $10 per class. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

6x + 10y = 60

Since Manny can't attend a fraction of a class, we need to find the maximum whole number of classes he can attend at $6 per class.

We can start by trying different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

If x = 1, 6(1) + 10y = 60
6 + 10y = 60
10y = 54
y = 5.4 (not a whole number)

If x = 2, 6(2) + 10y = 60
12 + 10y = 60
10y = 48
y = 4.8 (not a whole number)

If x = 3, 6(3) + 10y = 60
18 + 10y = 60
10y = 42
y = 4.2 (not a whole number)

If x = 4, 6(4) + 10y = 60
24 + 10y = 60
10y = 36
y = 3.6 (not a whole number)

If x = 5, 6(5) + 10y = 60
30 + 10y = 60
10y = 30
y = 3

Since x = 5 and y = 3 is a whole number solution, Manny can attend 5 classes at $6 per class and 3 classes at $10 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to calculate how many customers each of them processes in a week.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes twice the number of customers Jewel does in a day. So, Julie's daily production is 50 * 2 = 100 customers.

Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to first determine how many miles Reggie ran. We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. Let's represent the number of miles Lynn ran as 'x'. Since Reggie ran 3 miles more than Lynn, we can write an equation: x + 3 = 20.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: x + 3 - 3 = 20 - 3. This simplifies to x = 17.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to calculate the cost of each separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of 5 apples. We know that 4 apples cost $5.20, so we can find the cost of 1 apple by dividing $5.20 by 4.

Cost of 1 apple = $5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30

Now, we multiply the cost of 1 apple by 5 to find the cost of 5 apples.

Cost of 5 apples = $1.30 * 5 = $6.50

Next, let's find the cost of 5 oranges. We know that 3 oranges cost $3.30, so we can find the cost of 1 orange by dividing $3.30 by 3.

Cost of 1 orange = $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10

Now, we multiply the cost of 1 orange by 5 to find the cost of 5 oranges.

Cost of 5 oranges = $1.10 * 5 = $5.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost.

Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the time it takes to dig the hole, we need to calculate the volume of the hole first. The formula for volume is length times width times depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add up the base price and the costs of the extra features.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so we need to divide $7,500 by 3 to find the cost of the leather seats: $7,500 ÷ 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so we need to subtract $500 from $2,500 to find the cost of the running boards: $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To find out how much money Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's find the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary. To do this, we multiply $20,000 by 0.05 (which is the same as 5%).
$20,000 * 0.05 = $1,000
Now, we add this to his original salary to get his new monthly salary:
$20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, we need to find the bonus, which is half a month's salary. We can do this by dividing $20,000 by 2:
$20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, we add the bonus to his new monthly salary to get his total monthly income:
$21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

"To find the total cost of James' new wardrobe, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them up.

First, let's find the cost of the suits: 10 suits * $750 = $7500.

Next, we need to find the cost of the dress pants. Since they cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit, we multiply the cost of a suit by 1/5: $750 * 1/5 = $150. Then, we multiply this by the number of pants: 10 pants * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's find the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 shirts per suit, and there are 10 suits. So, the total number of shirts is 10 suits * 3 shirts/suit = 30 shirts. The cost of each shirt is $60, so the total cost of the shirts is 30 shirts * $60 = $1800.

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company is 10 * 28 = 280.

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites: 560 + 280 = 840.

The final answer is: 840"
"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to find the age of Steve's son first.

Steve's wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.

Since their son is half as old as his mom, we can find his age by dividing his mom's age by 2. So, he is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.

Now, we know that Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. To find her age, we subtract 3 from her husband's age: 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

First, let's find the distance Alisa biked. We know she biked at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply her speed by the time she biked: 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 54 miles.

Next, we'll find the distance Stanley biked. He biked at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply his speed by the time he biked: 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 25 miles.

Now that we have the distances biked by both Alisa and Stanley, we can add them together to find the total distance: 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles.

The final answer is: 79"
"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add them together.

First, let's find the time it takes to dig through the soil. Since Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

Time = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time = 6 hours

Next, let's find the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay, which means his rate is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour. We can use the same formula:

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay to find the total time:

Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fishio initially got 2000 likes on her selfie.
2. Three weeks later, the number of likes increased to 70 times the initial number of likes. 
   So, the number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 * 2000 = 140000.
3. Now, we need to find the total number of likes after Fishio received 20000 more new likes.
   To do this, we add the new likes to the total number of likes after 3 weeks.
   Total likes = 140000 + 20000 = 160000.

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two costs.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off because she had a voucher. So, the total cost is:
20 × $20 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost without the discount is:
20 × $30 = $600
The discount is 10% of $600, which is:
$600 × 0.1 = $60
So, the total cost with the discount is:
$600 - $60 = $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
$540 - $398 = $142

The final answer is: $142"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ariadne has a shop selling hats of two different colors, red and green. Her sales from red hats were $400 in a particular month, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. 

Let's call the total sales from green hats in the first month ""x"". Since the sales from red hats in the first month is half of x, we can write the equation as x/2 = $400. 

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = $400 * 2 = $800.

So, in the first month, Ariadne's total sales from green hats were $800 and from red hats were $400.

The total sales in the first month are $800 + $400 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month are 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total cost of hiring the horse-drawn carriage, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the total cost of those hours.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice the cost of the first hour, which is 2 * $15 = $30.

So, the total cost is $15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $30 (third hour) = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how much was withheld from Sally's wage, we need to calculate the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount she received.

First, let's find out how much she should have had in her account if she received her full wage.

Expected wage: $300
Initial amount in the account: $200
Expected total: $300 + $200 = $500

Since she actually has $420 in her account, we can find the difference between the expected total and the actual amount to determine how much was withheld.

Actual amount: $420
Expected total: $500
Withheld amount: $500 - $420 = $80

The final answer is: $80"
"To figure out how many eggs Lori needs, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves her guests will eat and then divide that by 2 since each egg makes 2 halves.

First, we multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat.

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since each egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find out how many eggs Lori needs.

Number of deviled egg halves needed: 48
Number of deviled egg halves per egg: 2
Number of eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12.

Number of eggs needed: 24
Number of eggs in a dozen: 12
Number of dozens of eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to calculate 2/3 of the total pages since she has already finished 1/3 of the paper.

Let's break it down:

Total pages = 15
Pages already written = 1/3 * 15
Pages already written = 5

Now, we need to find 2/3 of the total pages:
Pages left to write = Total pages - Pages already written
Pages left to write = 15 - 5
Pages left to write = 10

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Days to finish the book = Total pages / Pages read per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the total number of days.

Days before the deadline = Total days - Days to finish the book
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total cost of the plane, we need to add up the cost of the plane, the hanger rental, and the fuel cost.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The hanger rental is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hanger rental cost for a year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, so it is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total fuel cost for a year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the plane, the hanger rental, and the fuel cost: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To find the total cooking time, we need to determine the time it takes to cook each food item and then add them up.

First, we know it takes 30 minutes to cook rice. 

Next, we're told that it takes 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. So, the time to cook pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Now, we're given that beans take half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

Now, let's add up the cooking times for all the food: 
- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

Total cooking time = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes

"To find the cost of each mixture, we need to calculate the cost of almonds and walnuts separately and then add them together.

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: 1/2 pound * $10/pound = $5
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: 1/5 pound * $10/pound = $2
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the total number of animal legs is 70 and the total number of animal heads is 20. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the following equations:

4S + 2G = 70 (Equation 1: Total number of legs)
S + G = 20 (Equation 2: Total number of heads)

We can solve Equation 2 for G: G = 20 - S.

Now, substitute G = 20 - S into Equation 1: 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut.

First, let's find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find 20% of $5, we multiply $5 by 0.2, which is $1. 

So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week. The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"

Let's break it down:

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)

"To find the number of math teachers, we need to find out how many teachers are not history teachers. Since 60% of the teachers are history teachers, we can find the number of history teachers by multiplying 150 by 0.6.

Number of history teachers = 0.6 * 150
= 90

Now, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers
= 150 - 90
= 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Aurelia has $120. We're also given that Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. To find out how much Kassidy has, we multiply Aurelia's amount by 3/4.

Kassidy's money = (3/4) * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

Now, we're told that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we add 60 to Kassidy's amount to find out how much Rayna has.

Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now that we know how much each person has, we need to add up their money and divide it by 3 to find out how much each would have if they shared it equally.

Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150

"Let's break down Christina's mood records. We know that she had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Since there are 30 days in total, we can find the number of neutral days by subtracting the good and bad days from 30.

Neutral days = 30 - (12 + 8) = 30 - 20 = 10

We also know that the first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the next 8 days were neutral. This accounts for 24 days. 

Now, we need to find out how many good days are left. We know that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. So, we need to add these 3 days to the initial 8 good days.

Total good days so far = 8 + 3 = 11

However, we know that Christina had 12 good days in total. To find the number of good days left, we subtract the total good days so far from the total good days.

Good days left = 12 - 11 = 1

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. If Janey has 21 books, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

2x + 3 = 21

where 'x' is the number of books Sally has.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to find the value of 'x':

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books."
"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply the initial height by 12:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys. To find the total number of toys needed, we add the initial toys to the additional toys: 4 + 8 = 12 toys.

When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 8 dogs initially, there are now 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs. The total number of dogs is 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (initial additional dogs) + 16 (new dogs) = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys. To find the total number of toys needed so far, we add the initial toys to the additional toys: 12 + 28 = 40 toys.

When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. To find the final number of toys needed, we subtract the toys no longer needed from the total number of toys needed so far: 40 - 3 = 37 toys.

"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to calculate the remaining amount after Dylan and Frances invested.

First, let's find out how much Dylan invested. Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount, which is $1200. To find 2/5 of 1200, we multiply 1200 by 2 and then divide by 5.

(2/5) * 1200 = (2 * 1200) / 5
= 2400 / 5
= 480

So, Dylan invested $480. Now, let's find out how much money is left after Dylan's investment.

Remaining amount after Dylan's investment: 1200 - 480 = 720

Next, we need to find out how much Frances invested. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 720. To find 2/3 of 720, we multiply 720 by 2 and then divide by 3.

"To find out how much the 9 adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of the adults and then subtract the maximum load from that.

First, we need to find the total weight of the 9 adults. Since each adult weighs an average of 80 kg, we multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults.

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9
Total weight of 9 adults = 720 kg

Now, we need to find the difference between the total weight of the 9 adults and the maximum load of the elevator, which is 700 kg.

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's call the original length of the dress 'x'. 

The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, which is 0.5x. Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. So, the total added length is 0.5x + 20.

The final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: x + (0.5x + 20) = 140.

Combine like terms: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 1.5x = 120.

Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. We know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t.

We have two pieces of information: the sum of their ages is 44 and the older twin is 7 years older than the triplet. We can write these as two equations:

1. T + (T+7) + t = 44
2. T+7 = t+7

From the second equation, we can simplify it to find the relationship between T and t: T = t

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3t = 37

Divide by 3: t = 12.33

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, we need to find the age of one of the twins. The older twin is 7 years older than the younger twin, so we add 7 to the age of the younger twin: T+7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we need to first find the cost of one candy. We know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the cost of 4 candies by subtracting the cost of 5 lollipops from the total cost: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of 4 candies by 4: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of the vaccines. Since John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20, the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

Next, we know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To find the price of the crate of fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits in it. 

First, let's find the cost of one banana. Since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs twice as much, which is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, we find the cost of one orange. Since one banana costs $1, one orange costs three times as much, which is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color of squares and add them together.

Let's start by identifying the number of squares of each color:

- Red squares: 14
- Blue squares: 14 + 4 = 18
- Green squares: 18 + 6 = 24
- White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we add the number of squares of each color together: 
14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find out how many chairs Mia's restaurant needs to get, we need to know how many chairs she already has and how many she needs in total.

First, let's find out how many regular chairs she has. We know that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Since there are 8 high chairs, we multiply 8 by 5 to get the number of regular chairs.

8 high chairs * 5 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we need to find out how many chairs she needs in total. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function, so we add those together.

42 adults + 15 babies = 57 chairs needed

Next, we need to find out how many chairs she already has. We already know she has 8 high chairs and 40 regular chairs, so we add those together.

8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs

Now, we subtract the number of chairs she already has from the number of chairs she needs to find out how many more she needs to get.

48 chairs (available) - 57 chairs (needed) = -9

Since we can't have a negative number of chairs, this means she needs 9 more chairs."
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to first find the number of bucks in the field. Since 50 percent of the deer are bucks, we can calculate this by multiplying 50 (the total number of deer) by 0.5 (which represents 50 percent).

50 * 0.5 = 25

So, there are 25 bucks in the field. Now, we need to find 20 percent of the bucks that are 8 points. To do this, we multiply 25 by 0.2 (which represents 20 percent).

25 * 0.2 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we need to calculate the total points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom.

Let's start by finding out how many points Betty collected. Since she collected 30% more points than Adam, we can calculate this by finding 30% of Adam's points and adding it to his total. 

30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. 
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Next, we need to find out how many points Tom has. We know that he has 30 points less than Betty. 
So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Now, we're told that Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
So, Martha has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

The total points collected by the class is 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. 
The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip.

The final answer is: 145"
"To find the total number of great grand-babies, we need to follow the family tree. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children. Each of her children has 3 children of their own, making a total of 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren. Now, each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so we multiply 9 by 3 to find the total number of great grand-babies.

9 x 3 = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to do some simple math. First, let's figure out how much she puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her paycheck into it. To find 50% of a number, we multiply it by 0.5. So, 50% of $2400.00 is 0.5 x $2400.00 = $1200.00.

Next, let's calculate how much she uses for her car payment. She uses 20% of her paycheck for this. To find 20% of a number, we multiply it by 0.2. So, 20% of $2400.00 is 0.2 x $2400.00 = $480.00.

Now, let's subtract the amounts from her paycheck: $2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00.

So, Greta has $720.00 left to spend.

The final answer is: $720.00"
"To find the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we need to first determine the total number of pencils in the box. Since there are 4 pencils missing, we subtract 4 from the total capacity of the box.

Total capacity of the box = 20 pencils
Pencils missing = 4

Number of pencils in the box = Total capacity of the box - Pencils missing
= 20 - 4
= 16

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of pencils in the box. Since a pair consists of 2 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 2.

Number of pairs of pencils = Number of pencils in the box / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 × 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4:
0.4 × 300 = 120

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks from Hannah's backyard display. She will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard display is 3 × 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display:
120 + 15 = 135

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks bought and then multiply it by the cost per item.

First, let's find the total number of people: Aiden and his 12 friends, plus 7 more friends, equals 19 people.

Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, the total number of drinks and snacks bought is 19 * 2 (drinks) + 19 * 3 (snacks) = 38 drinks + 57 snacks = 95 items.

The cost per item is $2. So, the total amount spent on snacks and drinks is 95 items * $2 = $190.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

Now, let's add up the capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks: 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

We're told that when Gary joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Capacity of Gary's truck = Total capacity - Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks
= 11,600 - 8,800
= 2,800 pounds

The final answer is: 2800"
"To find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we need to figure out how many dumplings were eaten in total. We know that there are 8 males and 6 females, making a total of 14 people.

Each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. The total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

To find the total number of dumplings eaten, we add the number of dumplings eaten by females and males: 18 (by females) + 32 (by males) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much money Gerald had initially, we need to determine the total parts in the ratio and Gerald's share. The ratio is 3:2, so the total parts are 3 + 2 = 5.

Gerald's share is 3 out of 5 parts, so we can find his initial amount by multiplying 100 by 3/5.

Gerald's initial amount = (3/5) × 100 = $60

After spending $10 on a book, Gerald is left with:

Gerald's remaining amount = 60 - 10 = $50

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 ÷ 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We can use the formula Distance = Speed * Time.

Distance = Speed of the turtle * 40
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

"To find out how many hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to know how much they need to raise per hour and how much they still need to raise.

First, let's find out how much they raised per hour. They raised $2100 in 3 hours. To find the amount raised per hour, we divide the total amount raised by the number of hours: $2100 ÷ 3 = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The total goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. The remaining amount is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour: $4200 ÷ $700 = 6 hours.

Since they have already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours: 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that the city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. This is the total amount of water used by the city.

Next, we're told that 80% of the water used by the city is used for industrial purposes. To find this amount, we multiply the total percentage used by the city (40%) by the percentage used for industrial purposes (80%): 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 40% - 32% = 8%.

So, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To find Marcus' total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

First, let's find the cost of each item:

- 5 croissants at $3.00 each: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.10 (which is the decimal form of 10%): 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the deal offered by the ice cream parlor. They're offering a ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 free"" deal. This means that for every 3 scoops Erin buys, she'll only pay for 2.

Each scoop costs $1.50, so the total cost for 3 scoops would be 3 x $1.50 = $4.50. Since Erin has $6.00, she can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops, which would cost her 2 x $4.50 = $9.00. However, she only has $6.00, so she can't afford 2 sets of 3 scoops.

Let's try a different approach. If Erin buys 2 scoops, she'll pay $3.00 (2 x $1.50). She'll have $3.00 left over, which is enough to buy 2 more scoops, but she'll only get 1 free. So, she'll end up with 3 scoops.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of candies they eat in two weeks and subtract that from their initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 × 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 × 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs, we first need to calculate two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom. 

We can do this by multiplying 36 by 2 and then dividing by 3. 

36 * 2 = 72
72 / 3 = 24

So, Mr. Boarden needs to cover 24 sq ft. 

Since he needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we multiply 24 by 24 to find the total number of tiles needed.

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

The final answer is: 576"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Ron's car is going to get damaged if the pothole isn't fixed, and that's going to cost him $450. On the other hand, if he fixes it himself, he'll have to pay a fine of $120 and buy 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of the asphalt. Since there are 3 buckets and each one costs $25, we multiply 3 by $25 to get the total cost of the asphalt: 3 × $25 = $75.

Now, we add the fine and the cost of the asphalt to get the total cost of fixing the pothole: $120 + $75 = $195.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the total cost of fixing it from the total damage it will cause: $450 - $195 = $255.

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

"To find the total number of slices left, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people and subtract that from the total number of slices.

First, let's find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends who ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people in this group, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten as follows:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Next, we need to find the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends who ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since each of them ate 9 slices (3/4 * 12 = 9), the total number of slices eaten by these two friends is:

2 friends * 9 slices/friend = 18 slices

Now, we add the total number of slices eaten by both groups to find the total number of slices eaten:

24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

The total number of slices is 5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices. To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

However, we made an error in our calculation. We need to recalculate the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends who ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 5 people in total, and 2/3 of their pizzas were eaten, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten as follows:

5 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 5 * 8 = 40 slices

Now, we need to find the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends who ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since each of them ate 9 slices (3/4 * 12 = 9), the total number of slices eaten by these two friends is:

2 friends * 9 slices/friend = 18 slices

Now, we add the total number of slices eaten by both groups to find the total number of slices eaten:

40 slices + 18 slices = 58 slices

The total number of slices is 5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices. To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

60 slices - 58 slices = 2 slices

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches, so 8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches. 
Adding 4 inches to that gives us 96 + 4 = 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. 

We can write the equation as: x * 9 + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us: x * 9 = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us: x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, which is 1/4.
- Total windows smashed from students' cars = (1/4) × (64 × 4) = (1/4) × 256 = 64

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each.
- Hannah smashes 3/4 of the teachers' cars' windows.
- Total windows smashed from teachers' cars = (3/4) × (32 × 2) = (3/4) × 64 = 48

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars:
Total windows smashed = 64 + 48 = 112

The final answer is: 112"
"To find the percentage of blue spools, we need to first calculate the total number of blue spools. We have 15 light blue spools and 45 dark blue spools, so the total number of blue spools is 15 + 45 = 60.

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. We have 15 light blue, 45 dark blue, 40 light green, and 50 dark green spools, so the total number of spools is 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

(60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

First, let's find out how many people voted by midday. 2/5 of 5000 people had voted by then. 

2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

Now, we need to find out how many people voted by 16:00. 2/3 of the remaining people had voted by then. The number of people remaining after midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00.
5000 - (2000 + 2000) = 5000 - 4000 = 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days and then divide that by the number of pieces in a pack.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. In 30 days, he will chew 4 * 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

A pack of gum has 15 pieces of chewing gum per pack. To find out how many packs Parker will need, we divide the total number of pieces he will chew by the number of pieces in a pack: 120 / 15 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we need to calculate the total number of smores required. 

First, let's find out how many smores the kids want. Since 9 kids want 2 smores each, we multiply 9 by 2 to get the total number of smores for kids: 9 * 2 = 18.

Next, we calculate the number of smores the adults will eat. Since 6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, we multiply 6 by 1 to get the total number of smores for adults: 6 * 1 = 6.

Now, we add the number of smores for kids and adults to get the total number of smores required: 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, we divide the total number of smores required by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed: 24 / 8 = 3.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we divide the number of sleeves needed by 3 to find the number of boxes required: 3 / 3 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. This can be expressed as 2x + 8, where x is Dora's age. So, Dora's father's age = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. This can be expressed as x - 4, where x is Dora's father's age. So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age 
= 15 + 38 + 34 
= 87 years.

$20 ÷ 3 = $6.67

So, each of Greg's siblings got $6.67."
"To find the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we need to add up the weights of all her books. 

First, let's find the total weight of her math books. Since she has 2 math books and each weighs 2 pounds, the total weight of her math books is 2 x 2 = 4 pounds.

Next, we know that her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds.

We're also told that her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, her history book weighs 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all her books: 4 (math) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many votes candidate C got, we need to figure out how many votes candidate B got first. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. To find 50% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.5, which is 10. Then we add that to 20, so 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now we know that candidate A and candidate B got a total of 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Since there are 100 voters in total, candidate C got the rest of the votes, which is 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Boris initially has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so we can find Beck's initial amount by subtracting 23 from 100.

Beck's initial apples = 100 - 23 = 77

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. To find Beck's new amount, we add 10 to her initial amount.

Beck's new apples = 77 + 10 = 87

Boris also gives away 10 apples, so we subtract 10 from his initial amount to find his new amount.

Boris's new apples = 100 - 10 = 90

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's new amount from Boris's new amount.

Difference = 90 - 87 = 3

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now."
"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the total amount of water he started with.

First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube:

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 3 × 4 = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 7 × 2 = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 8 × 0.5 = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Clara has 20 books. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, we can find out how many books Steven has by dividing Clara's total by 2. 

Steven's books = Clara's books / 2
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. So, we can find out how many books Alice has by adding 6 to Steven's total.

Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's total from Clara's total.

Difference in books = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference in books = 20 - 16
Difference in books = 4

"To find the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we need to calculate the cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5 and it's $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can find the cost of a half-gallon jar by subtracting $2 from the cost of a gallon jar.

Cost of a gallon jar = $5
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2 = $3

Now, we can find the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Total cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 × $5 = $50
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 × $3 = $48

To find the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we add the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Total amount of money Cecelia spent = Total cost of 10-gallon jars + Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total amount of money Cecelia spent = $50 + $48 = $98

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are 50 students in the class. Out of these, 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. The rest of the students like to either play video games or play music.

First, let's find the number of students who like to play music. We are given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, let's find the total number of students who like to either play video games or play music. This is equal to the total number of students minus the number of students who like to bake and the number of students who like to play basketball.

Total students who like to play video games or music = Total students - (students who like to bake + students who like to play basketball)
= 50 - (10 + 5)
= 50 - 15
= 35

Since we know that 10 students like to play music, the number of students who like to play video games is equal to the total number of students who like to play video games or music minus the number of students who like to play music.

Students who like to play video games = Total students who like to play video games or music - students who like to play music
= 35 - 10
= 25

So, 4 birds were scared away. 

Now, we subtract 4 from the initial number of birds: 
12 - 4 = 8

Then, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. 
8 + 20 = 28

The final number of birds in the backyard is 28."
"To find the number of boys in each class, we need to first determine the total number of students in each class. Since there are two classes with a total of 80 students, we can divide 80 by 2 to find the number of students in each class.

80 ÷ 2 = 40 students per class

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can multiply the number of students in each class by 40% (or 0.4):

40 × 0.4 = 16 girls per class

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

40 - 16 = 24 boys per class

Daily savings = (500 * 0.5) - (500 * 0.4)
Daily savings = 250 - 200
Daily savings = 50

Now, we multiply the daily savings by 7 to find the weekly savings.

Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7
Weekly savings = 50 * 7
Weekly savings = 350

"To find out how many more groups are needed, we need to determine the total number of students required for 12 groups and compare it to the number of students we already have.

First, let's find the number of students per group by dividing the total number of students by the initial number of groups.

Total students = 54
Initial number of groups = 6

Students per group = Total students / Initial number of groups
Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

Now, we need to find the total number of students required for 12 groups.

Total students required = Number of groups * Students per group
Total students required = 12 * 9
Total students required = 108

Since we already have 54 students, we need to find the number of additional students required to form 12 groups.

Additional students required = Total students required - Total students available
Additional students required = 108 - 54
Additional students required = 54

To find the number of additional groups required, we divide the additional students required by the number of students per group.

Additional groups required = Additional students required / Students per group
Additional groups required = 54 / 9
Additional groups required = 6

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. We need to find out how many buttons she has after trading some of her stickers.

First, Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. To find 90% of 30 small stickers, we multiply 0.9 by 30:

0.9 × 30 = 27

Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. To find 50% of 40 large stickers, we multiply 0.5 by 40:

0.5 × 40 = 20

Since each large sticker is worth one large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 × 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 3 small stickers, 20 large stickers, 27 small buttons, and 20 large buttons. To find the total number of buttons, we add these together:

"To determine the total number of shirts ordered, we need to calculate the number of students for each size and add them together.

Let's start by identifying the number of students for each size:

- Extra-small: 11 students
- Small: Since twice as many students need size small as extra small, we multiply the number of extra-small students by 2: 2 * 11 = 22 students
- Medium: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so we subtract 4 from the number of small students: 22 - 4 = 18 students
- Large: Half as many students need size large as size medium, so we divide the number of medium students by 2: 18 / 2 = 9 students
- Extra-large: Six more students need size extra-large than large, so we add 6 to the number of large students: 9 + 6 = 15 students

Now, let's add the number of students for each size together:
11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

The total number of shirts ordered is 75."

First, we know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 0.2 by 50.

0.2 * 50 = 10 people

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. Now, we need to find out how many people are left.

50 - 10 = 40 people

Next, we know that 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. To find 60% of 40, we multiply 0.6 by 40.

0.6 * 40 = 24 people

Now, we need to find out how many people are left who think horse #12 will win.

40 - 24 = 16 people

Therefore, 16 people think horse #12 will win.

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Since we found that there are 18 Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the three houses need a total of 250 cases of shingles. The first house needs half of what the second house needs, and the third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's say the second house needs x cases of shingles. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles, and the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We can write the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply the entire equation by 2: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Now, divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

"To find the total number of fruits George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas and add it to the number of bananas.

First, let's find 45% of 200 bananas. To do this, we multiply 200 by 0.45 (since 45% is the same as 45/100 or 0.45).

0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, we add the result to the number of bananas to find the total number of fruits.

Total number of fruits = 200 (bananas) + 90 (pears)
Total number of fruits = 290

The final answer is: 290"

"To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. To find out how much money Sam needs to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we need to calculate the total amount of oranges required and the total cost of those oranges.

First, we need to find out how many kilograms of oranges Sam needs to make 4 liters of juice. Since he needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, we multiply the amount of oranges needed for 1 liter by 4. This gives us 5 * 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Next, we need to find out the total cost of the oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so we multiply the total amount of oranges needed (20 kilograms) by the cost per kilogram ($3). This gives us 20 * 3 = $60.

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to divide the number of books Ezra read by 2, since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so Ezra will read 300 + 150 = 450 books in total.

Now, we need to find the total number of books both Ezra and Ahmed read. 

Total books read by Ahmed = 150
Total books read by Ezra = 450
Total books read by both = 150 + 450 = 600

The final answer is: 600"
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings for Monday. She teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

Next, let's calculate her earnings for Wednesday. She teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches only 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she does not earn an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add the earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents, and since they have 4 vanilla scents available, we multiply 5 by 4 to get the total number of vanilla scents sold: 5 × 4 = 20.

Next, we calculate the total number of fruity scents sold. They sold 2 fruity scents, and since they have 8 fruity scents available, we multiply 2 by 8 to get the total number of fruity scents sold: 2 × 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold. To do this, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold: 20 - 16 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to calculate how much money he makes from selling the eggplants and then figure out how much he needs to make from the corn.

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he makes from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he already makes $60 from eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

Now, we need to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for. We can do this by dividing the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 ÷ 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we need to first calculate the total time she has available and the time she spends playing soccer.

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time
Remaining time = Total time available - Time spent reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total time available - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
= 12 - 3 - 3
= 6 hours

Now, we can find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer:
Percentage = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
= (6 / 12) * 100
= 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils and gave 1/2 of them to Brandon. 
   To find 1/2 of 50, we multiply 50 by 1/2, which is the same as dividing 50 by 2. 
   50 ÷ 2 = 25 pencils given to Brandon.
   So, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

2. Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie.
   To find 3/5 of 25, we multiply 25 by 3 and then divide by 5.
   25 × 3 = 75, then 75 ÷ 5 = 15 pencils given to Charlie.
   So, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's find the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum. We know the distance to the museum is 150 miles and his speed is 75 miles per hour. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since Jack has to drive back home, we need to double the time it takes to drive to the museum. So, the total time driving is 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time Jack spends at the museum, which is 6 hours. 

Total time Jack is gone from home = Total time driving + Time at the museum
Total time Jack is gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time Jack is gone from home = 10 hours

"To find out how many wheels will be left, we need to calculate the total number of wheels needed for the toys and subtract that from the number of wheels in the box.

First, let's find the total number of wheels needed for the cars. Since each car needs 4 wheels, we multiply the number of cars by 4:

57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels

Next, we find the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles. Each motorcycle needs 2 wheels, so we multiply the number of motorcycles by 2:

73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, we add the number of wheels needed for the cars and the number of wheels needed for the motorcycles to get the total number of wheels needed:

228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Finally, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box to find the number of wheels left:

650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

"To find the price after a discount, we need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The original price of the laptop is $1000. To find 20% of $1000, we multiply $1000 by 0.20.

$1000 * 0.20 = $200

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price.

Final price = Original price - Discount amount
Final price = $1000 - $200
Final price = $800

So, you would have to pay $800 for the laptop after the 20% discount.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to break it down into three parts: the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we divide the total number of movies by 3:

$$\frac{600}{3} = 200$$

Since Mike can get these movies for $6 each, the cost of the movies in series is:

$$200 \times 6 = 1200$$

Next, let's find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:

$$600 - 200 = 400$$

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we multiply 400 by 0.4:

$$400 \times 0.4 = 160$$

The cost of the older movies is:

$$160 \times 5 = 800$$

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:

$$400 - 160 = 240$$

The cost of the normal movies is:

$$240 \times 10 = 2400$$

Now, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost:

$$1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400$$

The final answer is: $4400"

Cost of plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
Cost of apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together to find the total amount spent: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's find the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's find the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked to find the total distance to their vacation spot. 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the scores of Ava and Emma separately and then find the difference.

Let's assume Emma's score is x. 

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's enemy score is x + 8. 
Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava's berry score is x + 3.
Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, Ava's timer score is 30(60 - (x + 4)) = 30(56 - x) = 1680 - 30x.

The total score for Emma is x.

The total score for Ava is (x + 8) + (x + 3) + (1680 - 30x) = 2x + 8 + 3 + 1680 - 30x = -28x + 1691.

The difference in their scores is (-28x + 1691) - x = -29x + 1691.

However, we don't know the value of x. We need to find the value of x to calculate the difference.

Since we don't have any information about the value of x, we can assume that the difference in their scores is the difference in their enemy and berry scores, and the difference in their timer scores.

The difference in their enemy scores is 8.
The difference in their berry scores is 3.
The difference in their timer scores is 30(60 - (x + 4)) - 30(60 - x) = 30(-4) = -120.

The difference in their scores is 8 + 3 - 120 = -109.

The final answer is: -109"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two known pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas.

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Total cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Total cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60 = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each of the other two pizzas = 4 / 2 = 2 dollars

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is the sum of the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days, which is 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond. He bought a total of 17 fish from the pet store. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as W and the number of orange fish he bought as O.

We know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so we can write the equation: W + O = 17.

After adding the new fish to his pond, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This means the number of orange fish is equal to 2 times the number of white fish. Since he initially had 3 orange fish, the total number of orange fish is 3 + O. The total number of white fish is 4 + W. So, we can write the equation: 3 + O = 2(4 + W).

Now, let's solve the first equation for O: O = 17 - W.

Substitute this expression for O into the second equation: 3 + (17 - W) = 2(4 + W).

Simplify the equation: 20 - W = 8 + 2W.

Add W to both sides: 20 = 8 + 3W.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 12 = 3W.

Divide both sides by 3: W = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

First, we need to find the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The distance between his home and office is 5 miles, and he travels this distance twice a day (to and from work), so the total daily distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we can calculate the total weekly distance: 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Next, we need to find out how much fuel his car uses per week. We know his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon (MPG). To find out how many gallons of gas he uses per week, we divide the total weekly distance by the fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week ÷ 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we can calculate the total cost per week by multiplying the amount of fuel used by the price of gas: 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, then add them together.

First, let's find the value of the quarters. Since there are 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, we can multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter:

140 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $35

Next, let's find the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. To find 3/5 of 10, we can multiply 10 by 3/5:

10 * (3/5) = 10 * 3 / 5 = 30/5 = 6

So, Carrie spent 6 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, we can multiply the number of twenties she spent by the value of each twenty:

6 twenties * $20/twenty = $120

Now, we can add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties to find the total amount of money she spent:

$35 + $120 = $155

The final answer is: $155"

"To prevent the pipes from freezing, we need to find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to heat the house up to at least 32 degrees. 

First, we need to determine the current temperature. It's 45 degrees during the day, and it's 33 degrees colder during the night. So, the temperature during the night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Now, we need to find the temperature difference between the freezing point and the night temperature. This is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide the temperature difference by the heat each log provides: 20 / 5 = 4.

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To find the total number of seashells, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

First, we need to find the number of groups. Since there are 90 people and each group has 9 people, we can divide the total number of people by the number of people per group.

Number of groups = Total number of people ÷ Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 ÷ 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we need to find the number of groups that brought back seashells. Since 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells, we can multiply the total number of groups by this fraction.

Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups × (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 × (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we need to find the total number of seashells. Since each group that brought back seashells had 2 seashells, we can multiply the number of groups that brought back seashells by the number of seashells per group.

Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells × Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 × 2
Total number of seashells = 12

First, let's find the total number of students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class, so we multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class.

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 40 * 25 = 1000 students

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is equal to the total number of students.

Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

Next, we need to find the total number of trees planted by the teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class, so we multiply the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class.

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 40 * 3 = 120 teachers

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is equal to the total number of teachers multiplied by 2.

Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 120 * 2 = 240 trees

Now, we add the total number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to find the total number of trees planted.

Total trees planted = Total trees planted by students + Total trees planted by teachers
Total trees planted = 1000 + 240
Total trees planted = 1240

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has and then determine how many more she needs to buy to make the percentage of stuffed goats 30%.

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30%, so we will round to the nearest whole number that will make the percentage 30% or more.

To find the total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats, we can set up the equation: 

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3: 

14 + x = 100

"To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the target hours.

First, let's calculate the hours Kris played in 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and she plays for half an hour every day. So, the total hours she played in 2 weeks is 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kris played in 1 week. There are 7 days in a week, and she plays for 2 hours every day. So, the total hours she played in 1 week is 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

Now, we add the hours she played in 2 weeks and 1 week to find the total hours she has played: 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel 60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles.

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel 70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles.

The distance between the two cars will be the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars: 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the ring, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold, then add the 30% premium.

Cost of diamond: $600
Cost of gold: $300
Total cost of diamond and gold: $600 + $300 = $900

The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.3.

0.3 × $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold.

Total cost with premium: $900 + $270 = $1170

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate of Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of fourth-graders, and the pass rate of fourth-graders is 40/100, the pass rate of fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80 out of 400.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460

Next, let's find the total number of students:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has.

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, we need to find out how many chips he has in total.

2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with 144 chips.

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we need to find out how many inches long it can be. We know that the area of a rectangle (such as the mosaic) is length * width. Since we know the area (12 square inches) and the height (3 inches), we can find the length.

Area = length * width
12 = length * 3
length = 12 / 3
length = 4

"To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea drank by the students and add it to the amount of tea left.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea drank to gallons by dividing by 4: 38 ÷ 4 = 9.5 gallons.

The total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is the sum of the tea drank and the tea left, which is 9.5 + 10 = 19.5 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.5}$"
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to determine how many candies he has in total. 

Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then sold 150. To find out how many candies he has left, we subtract the number of candies sold from the initial number of candies: 100 - 150 = -50. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. This means that Dale must have ordered more candies to replace the ones he sold.

Dale then ordered 100 more candies. So, he now has 100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200 candies.

Since he sold 150 candies, we need to subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies to find out how many he still needs to sell: 200 - 150 = 50.

- March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

Now, we need to find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May. To do this, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 160 - 10 = 150.

"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch.

Let's start by dividing the total money made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 ÷ $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 ÷ 5
Average branches per day = 84

- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 × 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 × 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 × 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

"To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to first determine how many marshmallows are left after John and DeSean make their S'mores and drop some on the ground.

Let's start by calculating the total number of marshmallows used. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they use 18 marshmallows. They also drop 3 marshmallows on the ground, so the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is 18 + 3 = 21.

Now, we subtract the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number of marshmallows in the bag to find out how many are left. 

Total marshmallows in the bag = 35
Total marshmallows used and dropped = 21
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Since there are 2 kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have.

S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total time played by each person and then multiply it by the cost per minute.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. 
The two friends who are worse than Jack play for half the time, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each. 
The friend who is better than Jack plays for 1.5 times the time, so they play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes.

The total time played is 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is 1 / 20 = $0.05.

The total amount of money used is 840 * 0.05 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. Then the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the goats: 3 goats * $500 = $1500.

Next, we'll find the cost of the cows: 2 cows * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

So, John spent a total of $4500 at the market."
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Let's start by adding the number of chocolate and toffee cupcakes Paul already has: 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48 cupcakes.

Now, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which is 40 * 0.2 = 8.

Now, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16.

So, Joe gives away a total of 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine how much money the students raised in total. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we need to divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20) to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

So, each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 × 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 × 60 = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

The total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is the number of cars that were present when he got out of class for the lunch break, which is 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate his daily earnings first. We know he does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks that pay $1.20 each.

Daily earnings = Number of cycles per day * Number of tasks per cycle * Pay per task
Daily earnings = 30 * 5 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $180

Now, we multiply his daily earnings by 7 to find out his weekly earnings.

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * 7
Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to find her points in both games and add them together.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 
In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we add Sasha's points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food. We do this by subtracting the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have a total of 341 cards. We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has.

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and add them together.

Let's start by identifying the number of green eggs, which is given as 5. 

Since Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, we can calculate the number of blue eggs by multiplying the number of green eggs by 2: 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

Next, we know that Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so we subtract 1 from the number of blue eggs: 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Finally, we're told that Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. To find the number of yellow eggs, we can divide the number of pink eggs by 3: 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's calculate the cost of shipping. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles.

Cost of shipping = (0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20)
= 1.4 + 1.6
= $2.99

Now, let's calculate the refund amount. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32.

Refund amount = 0.75 * 32
= $24

To find the total amount Milly will lose, we need to add the cost of shipping to the difference between the purchase price and the refund amount.

Total loss = Cost of shipping + (Purchase price - Refund amount)
= 2.99 + (32 - 24)
= 2.99 + 8
= $10.99

The final answer is: $10.99"
"Let's break down Mulan's expenses and calculate how much money she has left.

First, we need to find out how much money Mulan has after her father gave her $100. We add the initial amount of money she had ($40) to the amount her father gave her ($100): $40 + $100 = $140.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent on the jeans and the bag. The two pairs of jeans cost $30 each, so the total cost of the jeans is 2 * $30 = $60. The bag costs $20. The total amount of money she spent is $60 (jeans) + $20 (bag) = $80.

Now, we subtract the total amount of money she spent from the total amount of money she had initially: $140 - $80 = $60.

So, Mulan has $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars. 
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends per week and multiply it by 4.

First, let's break down the time Britany spends on TikTok activities per week:

- Writing songs: 2 hours = 2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes
- Doing makeup: 15 minutes x 6 days = 90 minutes
- Recording videos: 18 videos x 4 minutes per video = 72 minutes

Now, let's add up the time she spends on each activity: 120 minutes + 90 minutes + 72 minutes = 282 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 282 minutes ÷ 60 = 4.7 hours

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 4.7 hours x 4 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items.

Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors, cost: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier, cost: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures, cost: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

Total cost of additional items: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Total cost: $129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To find out how much money Roy has saved, we need to follow the information given. First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Then, we're told that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we're given that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4: $30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00.

To find the total amount Roy has saved, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to understand the given information. We know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Saskay can lift 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12.

480 ÷ 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours, and then add them together.

Distance = Speed x Time

Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can divide the total time by the number of kangaroos to find the time it takes for one kangaroo. 

Time for one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Time for one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3
Time for one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, it will take them twice as long to travel across the highway. 

Time for one turtle = Time for one kangaroo * 2
Time for one turtle = 6 hours * 2
Time for one turtle = 12 hours

Since there are four turtles, we need to multiply the time it takes for one turtle by 4.

Time for four turtles = Time for one turtle * 4
Time for four turtles = 12 hours * 4
Time for four turtles = 48 hours

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to determine the number of dishes each person made and then add them together.

We know that Kora made 20 dishes. Since Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, we can find the number of dishes Rory made by adding 20 to Kora's total:

Rory's dishes = Kora's dishes + 20
Rory's dishes = 20 + 20
Rory's dishes = 40

Now, we know that Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory. To find the number of dishes Jada made, we multiply Rory's total by 2:

Jada's dishes = 2 * Rory's dishes
Jada's dishes = 2 * 40
Jada's dishes = 80

To find the total number of dishes made by all three, we add the number of dishes each person made:

Total dishes = Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes
Total dishes = 20 + 40 + 80
Total dishes = 140

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's help.

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has been paid $150 and her mom gave her $80, so the total amount of money she received is: $150 + $80 = $230.

Now, we know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so the total amount of money she has is the price of the laptop after trading in her old one plus the extra money she needs: $400 + $50 = $450.

Since Erika received $230, the amount of money she had in her purse initially is: $450 - $230 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Adam wants to eat some sliced apples. A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. Adam decides to slice 3 large and 5 small apples and then eats 15 slices.

First, let's find the total number of slices from the large apples. Since 1 large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, 3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 slices.

Next, let's find the total number of slices from the small apples. Since 1 small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, 5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Now, we add the total number of slices from the large and small apples together: 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to know the milk production rate per cow. Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, we can divide the total milk needed by the milk production rate per cow.

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to have 5 cows in total.

5 cows (required) - 3 cows (already have) = 2 cows

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

First, let's find the length of the glue stick that is left in each one. We know that a glue stick is 12 millimeters long originally.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so we multiply 12 by 1/6 to find the length of the glue stick that is left: 
12 * (1/6) = 12/6 = 2 millimeters

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so we multiply 12 by 2/3 to find the length of the glue stick that is left: 
12 * (2/3) = 24/3 = 8 millimeters

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so we multiply 12 by 1/2 to find the length of the glue stick that is left: 
12 * (1/2) = 12/2 = 6 millimeters

Now, we add the unused portions together: 
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."

Craig has $19 left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing the number of dishes by 2.

60 ÷ 2 = 30 socks

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter has 2 x 30 = 60 socks.

We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes, Peter has 60 ÷ 2 = 30 dishes.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the number of socks and dishes Jack has to the number of socks and dishes Peter has.

Total socks = 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) = 90
Total dishes = 60 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 90

The total number of socks and dishes together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students good at math only and both math and English.

Let's denote the number of students good at math as M, the number of students good at English as E, and the number of students good at both as B. We know that the total number of students is 20.

We are given that 5 students are good at math only (M - B) and 8 students are good at English only (E - B). Since the students good at both math and English are counted in both the math only and English only groups, we need to add them to the students good at math only to get the total number of students good at math.

We can set up the equation: M = (M - B) + B. However, we also know that the total number of students is the sum of students good at math only, students good at English only, and students good at both: 20 = (M - B) + (E - B) + B.

"To figure out how many groups can perform at the concert, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and then divide it by the time each group takes to perform.

First, let's find the total time for the concert. It's 2 hours, which is equal to 2 x 60 = 120 minutes.

Since there's a 10-minute intermission, we need to subtract that from the total time to get the time available for performances: 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long each group takes to perform. They get on stage in 2 minutes, perform for 6 minutes, and then exit in 2 minutes. So, the total time for each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the total time available for performances by the time each group takes: 110 / 10 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 0.75 * $300 = $225 per year.

After 1 year, Brenda will have: $300 (initial investment) + $225 (interest) = $525
After 2 years, Brenda will have: $525 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $750
After 3 years, Brenda will have: $750 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $975

"To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we need to find the number of white shirts with collars and subtract it from the total number of white shirts. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with collars is 40 / 2 = 20.

The number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we need to find the number of floral shirts with buttons and subtract it from the total number of floral shirts. The number of floral shirts with buttons is 20.

The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

The difference is 30 - 20 = 10.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two farms, Farm X and Farm Y, with 55 goats and 45 goats respectively. Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y.

First, we need to find out how many goats were sold from Farm Y. Since he sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as from Farm X, we multiply the number of goats sold from Farm X by 2.

Number of goats sold from Farm Y = 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we need to find the number of goats left in Farm Y. To do this, we subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm Y.

Number of goats left in Farm Y = 45 - 20 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of goats left in Farm X. We subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm X.

Number of goats left in Farm X = 55 - 10 = 45

Finally, we add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y to find the total number of goats left in both farms.

Total number of goats left = 45 + 25 = 70

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, then subtract the discount for the red food.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 times the cost of one basket, which is $25. So, 3 x $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 times the cost of one basket, which is $18. So, 3 x $18 = $54.

Now, we add the cost of the green and red food together: $75 + $54 = $129.

However, we also get a discount of $2 for each basket of red food. Since we bought 3 baskets of red food, the total discount is 3 x $2 = $6.

To find the final cost, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $129 - $6 = $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To find out how long it takes to clean half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we need to first figure out how many rooms that is. Since there are 90 rooms, half of that would be 45 rooms.

45 rooms / 2 = 45 rooms

Now, we need to find out how long it takes to clean 45 rooms. It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x + 8 - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 8x + 17 = 87.

Subtract 17 from both sides: 8x = 70.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 8.75.

However, since age cannot be a decimal, we need to re-examine the equation. Let's try to find a whole number solution.

We can start by trying different values of x. Since x is my age, it must be a positive integer.

Let's try x = 8: 8 + (8 + 3) + (8 - 2) + 3(8 + 3) - 1 = 8 + 11 + 6 + 3(11) - 1 = 8 + 11 + 6 + 33 - 1 = 57.

This is less than 87, so we need to try a larger value of x.

Let's try x = 9: 9 + (9 + 3) + (9 - 2) + 3(9 + 3) - 1 = 9 + 12 + 7 + 3(12) - 1 = 9 + 12 + 7 + 36 - 1 = 63.

This is still less than 87, so we need to try an even larger value of x.

Let's try x = 10: 10 + (10 + 3) + (10 - 2) + 3(10 + 3) - 1 = 10 + 13 + 8 + 3(13) - 1 = 10 + 13 + 8 + 39 - 1 = 69.

This is still less than 87, so we need to try an even larger value of x.

Let's try x = 11: 11 + (11 + 3) + (11 - 2) + 3(11 + 3) - 1 = 11 + 14 + 9 + 3(14) - 1 = 11 + 14 + 9 + 42 - 1 = 75.

This is still less than 87, so we need to try an even larger value of x.

Let's try x = 12: 12 + (12 + 3) + (12 - 2) + 3(12 + 3) - 1 = 12 + 15 + 10 + 3(15) - 1 = 12 + 15 + 10 + 45 - 1 = 81.

This is still less than 87, so we need to try an even larger value of x.

Let's try x = 13: 13 + (13 + 3) + (13 - 2) + 3(13 + 3) - 1 = 13 + 16 + 11 + 3(16) - 1 = 13 + 16 + 11 + 48 - 1 = 87.

This is equal to 87, so x = 13 is a possible solution.

"To determine the number of packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks per pack.

First, we find the total number of glue sticks needed by multiplying the number of students by the number of glue sticks per student:

Total number of students: 27
Number of glue sticks per student: 2
Total number of glue sticks required: 27 × 2 = 54

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack:

Number of glue sticks per pack: 8
Number of packs required: 54 ÷ 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to calculate the amount of water on each day and add them together.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it is 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we add the amounts from each day: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

- Initially, there are 10 people infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 new people are infected.
- Total people infected after Day 1: 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

Day 2: 
- The 60 people infected on Day 1 infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people.
- The 10 people initially infected also infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people.
- Total people infected after Day 2: 70 (previous) + 360 (new) + 60 (new) = 490.

Day 3: 
- The 360 people infected on Day 2 infect 360 * 6 = 2160 new people.
- The 60 people infected on Day 1 infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people.
- The 10 people initially infected also infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people.
- Total people infected after Day 3: 490 (previous) + 2160 (new) + 360 (new) + 60 (new) = 3070.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the rate at which each person earns badges and then calculate the total number of badges earned in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, Claire earns a total of 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges in a year.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns half the number of badges Claire does in the same time frame. This means Amber earns 1/2 badge/month. In a year, Amber earns 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the number of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Since Claire earns 1 badge per month, Wendy earns 3 badges per month. In a year, Wendy earns 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy: 36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges.

"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold, and then multiply that by the price per slice.

She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is equivalent to $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice:

80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to find the number of silver coins first. 

Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30 and G = 70.

Since G = S + 30 and G = 70, we can set up the equation S + 30 = 70.

To find S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:

S + 30 - 30 = 70 - 30
S = 40

Now that we know S = 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins:

Total coins = S + G
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

First, let's find the total number of burritos eaten by the students. There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos eaten by the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

The total number of burritos eaten is 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos in total, the number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

"To find the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars.

We know the rink has 12 red cars. Since they have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we can find the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have a total of 85 books. We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's use variables to represent the number of books each person has. Let F be the number of books Fawn has, A be the number of books Anne has, and S be the number of books Sofie has.

We can write two equations based on the given information:

1. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
2. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

We also know that S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)

Substituting the first equation into this equation, we get (F + 13) + A + F = 85
Combine like terms: 2F + A + 13 = 85

Substituting the second equation into this equation, we get 2F + (F - 12) + 13 = 85
Combine like terms: 3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides: 3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

The final answer is: 28"

"To find the change the seller will give back, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones and subtract that from the amount given.

First, let's find the total cost of the phones. We know the seller bought 5 phones for $700 each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of phones by the price of each phone:

5 phones * $700 = $3500

Now, we need to find the change. The seller gives $4000 in dollar bills. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:

$4000 - $3500 = $500

So, the seller will give back $500 in change.

The final answer is: $500"
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first figure out how much he pays in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays 40% of the total cost of $400.

To find 40% of $400, we multiply 0.4 by 400. 

0.4 x 400 = $160

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to divide the amount Keenan spends in a month by 4 to find out how much he spends per week.

$160 / 4 = $40

So, Keenan spends $40 per week.

"To find out how many pieces of pizza Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them up.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. He ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To do this, we multiply 2/5 by 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24 pieces

Next, we know he ate 10 pieces on the second day.

Now, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the third day. He ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. First, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. We subtract the pieces he ate on the first two days from the total number of pieces.

60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left

Now, we multiply 7/13 by 26.

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13
= 182 / 13
= 14 pieces

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate on each day:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we need to first find the cost of 1 bottle of soda and 1 bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of soda is $21.00 ÷ 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of water is $8.00 ÷ 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 × $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 × $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to first determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Now, we know he plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each. To find the total amount of money he will make from selling the chickens, we multiply the number of chickens by the price per chicken:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, we are told that he needs to make a profit of $2000, so the total amount he needs to make from selling the chickens is $9000 + $2000 = $11000.

Since he will make $9000 from selling the chickens, we need to find the cost price of the chickens. To do this, we subtract the profit from the selling price:

Cost price = Selling price - Profit
Cost price = $9000 - $2000
Cost price = $7000

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we need to determine the number of glasses Micah sold. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses sold by 2.

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people selling glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many more glasses she sold than Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the manicure. Since it's 1/4 as much as the hair service, we can multiply the cost of the hair service by 1/4. The cost of the hair service is $400, so the cost of the manicure is:

1/4 × $400 = $100

Next, let's find the cost of the pedicure. It's 3/4 as much as the manicure, so we can multiply the cost of the manicure by 3/4. The cost of the manicure is $100, so the cost of the pedicure is:

3/4 × $100 = $75

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

"To find out when Melanie's age will be thrice her present age, we need to first determine her current age. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Now, let's set up an equation to find out when her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call the number of years it takes for her age to be thrice her present age 'x'. At that time, her age will be 8 + x, and it will be thrice her current age, which is 3 * 8 = 24.

We can set up the equation: 8 + x = 24.

To solve for x, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

8 + x - 8 = 24 - 8
x = 16

So, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples. 

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120, since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14, since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

Since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly has overspent her budget by $91.

The amount of money Kelly has left in her budget is $0.

Final Answer: The final answer is $0."
"To find the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to figure out how long they are before she makes the final concert twice as long. Let's call the runtime of her usual concert x minutes.

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x minutes. We also know that the encore is 15 minutes long. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15, 2x = 50.

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2, x = 25.

The runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage, we need to figure out how many microphones can be paired up. Since 20% of the microphones won't fit, that means 80% of the microphones will be paired up.

Let's use the equation: 80% of 50 = number of pairs of microphones

We can write this as a decimal: 0.8 * 50 = number of pairs of microphones

Now, let's solve for the number of pairs of microphones:
0.8 * 50 = 40

Since each pair has 2 microphones, we need to divide the total number of microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs:
40 / 2 = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds in the bushes are flying overhead, we can multiply the number of birds in the bushes by 2/3.

Number of birds in the bushes: 6
Number of birds flying overhead: (2/3) * 6 = 4

Next, we need to find the number of birds feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we can multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group.

Number of birds feeding: 3 * 8 = 24

Now, let's add the number of birds in each group to find the total number of birds.

Total number of birds = Number of birds in the bushes + Number of birds flying overhead + Number of birds feeding

"To find the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we need to determine the number of flowering plants first.

We know that one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants. So, the number of indoor plants is 100 * (1/4) = 25.

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants: 75 * (2/3) = 50.

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants: 75 - 50 = 25.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

So, the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden is 25%.

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ellen buys 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

We know that the total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11. Let's represent the cost of one carrot as 'x'. Then, the cost of 2 carrots is 2x.

The total cost equation is: 2x + 6 (salad) + 3 (yogurt) = 11

Combine the constants: 2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2: x = 1

The cost of one carrot is $1."
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We also know that she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. Similarly, since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x + 3x + 5x = 9x.

Since she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

To find the amount she made from lemonade sales, we need to isolate y. We can do this by subtracting 54x from both sides of the equation:

54x + y = 80
y = 80 - 54x

Since we don't know the value of x, we can't find the exact amount she made from lemonade sales. However, we can express it in terms of x.

But, we are given that she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. This means that x = 1 (since she made $6 for mowing 1 lawn). 

Now, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation y = 80 - 54x to find the amount she made from lemonade sales:

y = 80 - 54(1)
y = 80 - 54
y = 26

The final answer is: $26"

So, Martha had 2 notebooks initially.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, we multiply the number of notebooks Martha had by 3 to find out how many notebooks Joseph had:

2 (Martha's initial notebooks) * 3 = 6

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. We subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

"To find out how much material Jo needs to make face masks for her class, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

First, let's find out how much material is needed for the small masks. We know that 2 yards of material can make 4 small masks. So, the amount of material needed for one small mask is 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards per mask. To make 20 small masks, we multiply the material needed for one mask by 20: 20 * 0.5 yards = 10 yards.

Next, let's find out how much material is needed for the large masks. We know that 2.25 yards of material can make 3 large masks. So, the amount of material needed for one large mask is 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards per mask. To make 8 large masks, we multiply the material needed for one mask by 8: 8 * 0.75 yards = 6 yards.

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks together: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

First, let's find out how many marbles he gave to Jamie. Since he gave 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie, we can calculate this by multiplying 30 (the total number of marbles) by 1/5. 

30 × (1/5) = 30 ÷ 5 = 6

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Next, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

In total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the number of marbles he gave away from the total number of marbles he had initially. 

30 - 16 = 14

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
(60 - 8) = 2x
52 = 2x
x = 26

Now, we need to find Adam's current age. Since Adam's age four years ago was 26, his current age is 26 + 4 = 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age: 30 + 8 = 38.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total acres of both farms, we need to calculate the acres of Farmer Smith's farm first. Since his farm is 100 acres more than twice the acres of Farmer Brown's farm, we can represent this as an equation:

Farmer Smith's farm = 2 * Farmer Brown's farm + 100

Given that Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Farmer Smith's farm = 2 * 200 + 100
Farmer Smith's farm = 400 + 100
Farmer Smith's farm = 500 acres

Now, we can find the total acres of both farms by adding the acres of Farmer Brown's farm to the acres of Farmer Smith's farm:

Total acres = Farmer Brown's farm + Farmer Smith's farm
Total acres = 200 + 500
Total acres = 700 acres

The final answer is: 700"
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

In an 8-hour workday, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day are 320 * $0.20 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then divide it by 30 minutes (since he drinks a bottle every half hour).

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so it takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle every 30 minutes, we need to divide the total time by 30 to find out how many bottles he drinks. 

180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna and that there are 20 red balloons.

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as y. The total number of balloons is the sum of red and yellow balloons, which is 20 + y.

The total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40. The total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3 * y.

Since the total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, we can set up the equation: 40 + 3y = 58.

To solve for y, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation: 3y = 18.

Then, we divide both sides by 3: y = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To figure out how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we need to know how many miles he drives in 30 days. Since he drives 100 miles a day, we multiply 100 miles by 30 days.

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Now, we need to find out how many 1000-mile intervals are in 3000 miles. We can do this by dividing 3000 miles by 1000 miles.

3000 miles / 1000 miles = 3

So, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and add them up.

Let's start with Tuesday. Bruce works 5 hours on this day.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday. So, we multiply the hours he works on Tuesday by 2: 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. So, we subtract 2 hours from the hours he works on Wednesday: 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

The cost of the cake is $11.
The cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, the number of 2-balloon sets is 12 / 2 = 6. So, the cost of 1 dozen balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2: $28 / 2 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To find out how many pieces of fruit Kira bought in total, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit, we need to subtract 2 from the total number of fruits Kira bought.

14 - 2 = 12

So, there are 12 pieces of fruit left.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students playing each sport and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of students playing tennis. We're given that there are 6 students playing tennis.

Next, we need to find the number of students playing volleyball. Since it's stated that there are twice as many students playing volleyball as there are playing tennis, we can multiply the number of students playing tennis by 2. So, 6 * 2 = 12 students are playing volleyball.

Now, let's find the number of students playing soccer. We're given that there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

To find the total number of students, we add the number of students playing each sport: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total profit made by the class, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. The price of each lollipop is $0.8, and each student sold 10 lollipops. Since there are 30 students, the total number of lollipops sold is 30 * 10 = 300. So, the total revenue is 300 * $0.8 = $240.

Next, let's find the total cost. The cost of each lollipop is $0.5, and each student bought 10 lollipops. Since there are 30 students, the total number of lollipops bought is 30 * 10 = 300. So, the total cost is 300 * $0.5 = $150.

Now, we can find the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $240 - $150 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them up.

First, we know Larry has 3 cats.

Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, we can multiply the number of cats by 3 to find the number of dogs: 3 × 3 = 9 dogs.

Next, we know he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so we subtract 2 from the number of dogs: 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Now, we need to find the number of fish. Since he has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, we multiply the number of rabbits by 3: 3 × 7 = 21 fish.

Finally, we know he has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so we divide the number of fish by 3: 21 ÷ 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The final answer is: 47"
"To determine how many days a loaf of bread will last for Abby and Josh, we need to calculate their combined daily bread consumption.

Abby eats 2 slices of bread per day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices per day.

Their combined daily consumption is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we divide the total number of slices by their combined daily consumption: 24 / 6 = 4.

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since Martha collects one shell per month, we can simply multiply the number of years she has been collecting by 12 months/year.

Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old, and by her 10th birthday, she has been collecting for 5 years. 

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell/month.

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we need to first determine how many cups of tea are in each row. 

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She divides these into 3 rows. 

So, the number of cups in each row is 27 ÷ 3 = 9 cups.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also 9 ÷ 2 = 4.5. However, since you can't have half a cup of tea, this means that the number of mint tea cups in each row must be 4 or 5.

Let's consider both possibilities:

If there are 4 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 5 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 4 = 12. 

If there are 5 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 4 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 5 = 15.

Since the total number of mint tea cups is 15, the correct answer is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours. Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips.

Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he can make 2 trips, we need to divide the total number of berries by the number of trips to find the minimum number of berries he can pick up per trip. 

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we need to first determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, we can calculate this by dividing the total amount of water in the pool by 2.

Initial water in the tank = Total water in the pool / 2
= 10000 gallons / 2
= 5000 gallons

Next, we need to find the total amount of water used from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so we can multiply this rate by the number of days to find the total amount of water used.

Total water used = Rate of water usage * Number of days
= 500 gallons/day * 6 days
= 3000 gallons

Now, we can find the remaining amount of water in the tank by subtracting the total amount of water used from the initial amount.

Remaining water in the tank = Initial water in the tank - Total water used
= 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons
= 2000 gallons

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"Let's break down Colby's expenses and see how many movies he can afford to see.

Colby's monthly budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday. 

Now, let's calculate how much money is left for other days: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (round down to 1 since you can't see a fraction of a movie) more movie on other days.

Total movies Colby can see: 1 (on Friday) + 1 (on other days) = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini pastry has 1/3 of the calories of a normal version. So, a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

Now, let's find the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, let's find the calories of a mini blueberry muffin. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini pastry has 1/3 of the calories of a normal version. So, a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's find the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins. Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories from both types of pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to find the total number of Junebugs she removed and divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days = 378 / 5 = 75.6

The average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is 75.6."
"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply their speeds by the time they traveled. 

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so it traveled 60 × 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so it traveled 30 × 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to determine how many toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls and then subtract that from the total number of toys after the purchase.

Let's start by adding up the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings. 

Number of blocks = 31
Number of stuffed animals = 8
Number of stacking rings = 9

Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls = 31 + 8 + 9
= 48

We know that after buying the bouncy balls, Sophie had a total of 62 toys. To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract the total number of toys before buying bouncy balls from the total number of toys after buying bouncy balls.

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys after buying bouncy balls - Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls
= 62 - 48
= 14

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and Jean's age as J.

We can write the following equations based on the given information:

1. P + Pp + J = 100
2. Pp = J + 10
3. P = Pp + J

From equation 2, we can substitute Pp with J + 10 in equation 1:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now, we can substitute P with Pp + J in the equation P + 2J + 10 = 100:
(Pp + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Substitute Pp with J + 10:
(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we have J, we can find Pp:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 20 + 10
Pp = 30

Now that we have Pp, we can find P:
P = Pp + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

"To find the total number of water balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 balloon, and each of her 4 friends had 2 balloons. So, the total number of balloons initially is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 * 3 = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons

The final answer is: 24"
"To figure out how many tables they need, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

First, let's find out how many boxes they got from donations. Since 10 people donated 5 boxes each, we multiply 10 by 5 to get 50 boxes from donations. 

Now, we add the boxes they already had, which is 10. So, the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need. 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so we subtract that from the total number of tables they need. 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide by the number of seeds.

Zoey's total distance is found by multiplying the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Sydney's total distance is found by multiplying the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

The total distance spat is the sum of Zoey's and Sydney's total distances: 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the total number of seeds: 820 / (40 + 35) = 820 / 75 = 10.93 feet.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many widgets each machine can make in a month. We know that the Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day and 30 days in a month, we multiply the number of widgets each machine makes per hour by the number of hours in a day and the number of days in a month.

For the Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
For the WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, we need to find out how much money each machine will make in a month. We know that each widget sells for $6. So, we multiply the number of widgets each machine makes by the price of each widget.

For the Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
For the WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of money each machine will make. We do this by subtracting the amount of money the WidgetMaster 9000 will make from the amount of money the Widgeteer 3000 will make.

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay with the 24-hour option and the cost of his stay with the 12-hour option plus the additional hours.

Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours. 

The 24-hour option costs 1600 pesos. 

The 12-hour option costs 1000 pesos, and Cameron needs to add 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark. Since he stays for 17 hours, he needs to add 70 * 5 = 350 pesos for the additional 5 hours.

So, the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we need to calculate the amount each sheep needs first. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Let's start by finding twice the amount each goat needs: 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

Now, we subtract 3 pounds from that amount to find out how much each sheep needs: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now that we know each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"Let's break down John's situation step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money John earned in a week. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:

50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

Next, we need to subtract the cost of gas and the deposit from his earnings. He spends 50 dollars on gas and wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank.

Remaining money = Earnings - Gas cost - Deposit
= 300 - 50 - 100
= 150 dollars

Now, let's calculate how much money John has left after buying 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each.

Cost of pencils = 5 * 10 dollars
= 50 dollars

Remaining money after buying pencils = Remaining money - Cost of pencils
= 150 - 50

"To find out how much Patty charged for the job, we need to add up the cost of the visit, the cost of the parts, and the labor cost.

First, let's calculate the labor cost. Since Patty charges $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours, we multiply the number of hours by the hourly rate:

2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

Next, we add the cost of the parts, which is $60, and the visit fee, which is $40.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts + Visit fee
Total cost = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total cost = $178.75

So, Patty charged a total of $178.75 for the job.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

James buys 10 CDs at $15 each, so the total cost is 10 * $15 = $150. However, he gets a 40% discount, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60. So, the price after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

Now, James sells 5 CDs for $40 each, making a total of 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we need to subtract the amount he made from the amount he spent. So, he was out $90 - $200 = -$110. Since we can't have a negative amount of money, this means he actually made a profit of $110.

"To find out how much Jen will earn from selling her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of crop and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the yams. Since she has 6 yams and each one sells for $1.5, we multiply the number of yams by the price per yam: 6 * $1.5 = $9.

Next, we calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes. Jen has 10 sweet potatoes, and each one costs $2. So, we multiply the number of sweet potatoes by the price per sweet potato: 10 * $2 = $20.

Lastly, we calculate the earnings from the carrots. Jen has 4 carrots, and each one sells for $1.25. We multiply the number of carrots by the price per carrot: 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the earnings from each type of root crop together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the time it took James to swim across the lake, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, let's find the distance James swims before resting. Since he swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, we can calculate this distance as follows:

60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday and then subtract 40 from that result.

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 × 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had, so we subtract 40 from 490: 490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to determine the initial number of stickers Jasmine had. She was given 15 stickers for participating in class. However, she lost 7 stickers during playtime. To find out how many stickers she has left after losing some, we subtract the number of stickers she lost from the initial number of stickers: 15 - 7 = 8.

Next, we need to account for the additional stickers she received for helping her classmates. Her teacher gave her 5 more stickers, so we add this to the number of stickers she had after losing some: 8 + 5 = 13.

Therefore, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To find the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the commission from the New York Times. We know that Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy sold. If each copy costs $5, then the commission per copy is 10% of $5, which is 0.1 x 5 = $0.50. Since Cayley sold 6 copies, the total commission from the New York Times is 6 x $0.50 = $3.

Next, let's find the commission from the Wall Street Journal. Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy sold. If each copy costs $15, then the commission per copy is 8% of $15, which is 0.08 x 15 = $1.20. Since Cayley sold 10 copies, the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is 10 x $1.20 = $12.

Now, let's add the commission from both newspapers to find the total commission. The total commission is $3 + $12 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find Leo's age, we need to figure out how old he is based on the information given. We know that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. So, Marcus's age is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age. To do this, we multiply 21 by 2.

21 × 2 = 42

So, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored.

Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D.

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10.

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10.

We can simplify this equation to A = D - 10.

We also know that B + A + D = 45.

We can substitute B = A + 20 into the equation B + A + D = 45 to get (A + 20) + A + D = 45.

This simplifies to 2A + D + 20 = 45.

We can also substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45 to get (D + 10) + A + D = 45.

This simplifies to 2D + A + 10 = 45.

Now we have two equations: 2A + D + 20 = 45 and 2D + A + 10 = 45.

We can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate A: (2A + D + 20) - (2D + A + 10) = 45 - 45.

This simplifies to A - D + 10 = 0.

We can rearrange the equation to get A - D = -10.

Now we can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10.

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation B = A + 20 to get B = (D - 10) + 20.

This simplifies to B = D + 10.

We can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B = A + 20 to get D + 10 = A + 20.

We can subtract 10 from both sides to get D = A + 10.

Now we have A = D - 10 and D = A + 10.

We can substitute D = A + 10 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = (A + 10) - 10.

This simplifies to A = A.

We can substitute D = A + 10 into the equation 2A + D + 20 = 45 to get 2(A + 10) + A + 20 = 45.

This simplifies to 3A + 30 = 45.

We can subtract 30 from both sides to get 3A = 15.

We can divide both sides by 3 to get A = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, we have 2 pages per paper. Given that there are 100 pages to the inch, we can find the total number of pages per inch by multiplying 100 by 2, which equals 200 pages per inch.

Now, we know the book is 1.5 inches thick. To find the total number of pages in the book, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book: 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to figure out how many minutes he worked and then multiply that by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. He stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60:

15 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:

900 ÷ 15 = 60

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 60 sets of 15 minutes, we multiply the number of reports per set by the number of sets:

30 reports/set × 60 sets = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total time she slept and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

First, let's find out how many minutes she usually sleeps. Since she sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., we need to find the difference between these two times. We can do this by subtracting the hour and the minutes.

10 p.m. is 10 * 60 = 600 minutes after midnight, and 6 a.m. is 6 * 60 = 360 minutes after midnight. So, she usually sleeps for 600 - 360 = 240 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. This means she slept for 5:55 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 7 hours and 55 minutes. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying the hours by 60 and adding the minutes: 7 * 60 + 55 = 445 minutes.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time: 445 - 23 = 422 minutes.

The final answer is: 422"
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially, we need to first find the number of measuring cups he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we multiply 2 by 12 to get the total number of cups.

2 × 12 = 24 cups

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of spoons.

24 × (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, we subtract 6 from the total number of spoons to find the remaining number of spoons.

16 - 6 = 10 spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining spoons and the number of cups.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of occupied beds first. Since 1/5 of the beds are occupied, we can multiply 1000 by 1/5.

$$\frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200$$

This means 200 beds are occupied. Since 4/5 of the beds are unoccupied, we can multiply 1000 by 4/5.

$$\frac{4}{5} \times 1000 = 800$$

Now, we need to find out how many more beds will be occupied in 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we multiply 50 by 14 (the number of days in 2 weeks).

$$50 \times 14 = 700$$

Now, we add the number of occupied beds initially to the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks.

$$200 + 700 = 900$$

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds.

$$1000 - 900 = 100$$

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Robyn sends 16 emails a day. We know 7 of those are work emails, so we need to find out how many are not work-related. 

To do that, we subtract the number of work emails from the total number of emails: 16 - 7 = 9. This means Robyn sends 9 non-work emails a day.

Now, we're told that two-thirds of these non-work emails are to family. To find out how many emails that is, we multiply 9 by 2/3: 9 × (2/3) = 6. So, Robyn sends 6 emails to family.

That leaves us with 9 - 6 = 3 non-work emails that aren't to family. We're asked how many of these are to her boyfriend. We're told that one-third of these emails are to her boyfriend. To find that out, we multiply 3 by 1/3: 3 × (1/3) = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find Shawna's father's age, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we know that Aliya is 3 years old. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3.

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age. We are given that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. To find his age, we multiply Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported by Courtney and subtract it from the number reported by Courtney.

Let's assume the number reported by Courtney is 100%. To find 20% of 48, we multiply 0.20 by 48.

0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.

48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and he carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means that Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Now, we need to find the total number of balls carried by all three boys. To do this, we add up the number of balls each boy carried: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. This is the number of balls the boys carried. We need to find the total number of balls the coach brought, which is the sum of the balls the boys carried and the balls they left behind. Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, they must have carried all the balls the coach brought. Therefore, the total number of balls the coach brought is equal to the number of balls the boys carried.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to first determine the total number of holes at the end of the first day and then use that information to calculate the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

The pirates dug 10 holes the first day. 

On the second day, they dug 13 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Amora and Lainey got an equal amount of corn chips, which is 70 each. Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others. 

Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as x. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

Since Collins got x + 15 corn chips, we can set up the equation:

x + 15 = 70 + 15 (since Collins got 15 more than Amora and Lainey)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 15 = 85

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get:

x = 70

This confirms that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each. Now, we need to find the total number of corn chips. We know that Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:

Total = x + x + (x + 15)
Total = 2x + (x + 15)
Total = 3x + 15
Total = 3(70) + 15
Total = 210 + 15
Total = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, we find 50% of the cost of supplies: 50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Then, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel: $400 + $200 = $600.

The cost of travel is $600."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have caught a total of 339 Pokémon. We can represent the number of Pokémon caught by each of them as variables: A for Adelwolfe, S for Stan, and L for Alex.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, so we can write an equation: L = S + 5.
2. Stan has caught 13 fewer Pokémon than 4 times the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe, so we can write another equation: S = 4A - 13.

Now, let's use the fact that the total number of Pokémon caught is 339: A + S + L = 339.

We can substitute the first equation (L = S + 5) into the total equation: A + S + (S + 5) = 339.

Combine like terms: A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Now, substitute the second equation (S = 4A - 13) into the previous one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.

Expand the equation: A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.

Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide both sides by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe, we can find the number of Pokémon caught by Stan: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to know the number of episodes and the length of each episode. We're given that each episode is 20 minutes long.

The problem also states that there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, we can find the number of episodes by dividing 20 by 2, which equals 10 episodes.

Now, to find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's find the distance traveled in the first 10 hours. The bird flies at a speed of 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled is:

Distance = speed × time
Distance = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Next, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this direction is:

Distance = speed × time
Distance = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Since the bird is heading back north, we need to subtract this distance from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction.

Now, the bird flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this direction is:

Distance = speed × time
Distance = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

To find the net distance between the two homes, we add the distance traveled in the first 10 hours and the distance traveled in the last 5 hours, then subtract the distance traveled in the 2 hours:

Net distance = Distance traveled in the first 10 hours + Distance traveled in the last 5 hours - Distance traveled in the 2 hours
Net distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Net distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"To find out how many brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

First, let's find the total number of brownies Greta received. She made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. A dozen is equal to 12, so we can simply write this as 12 brownies.

She received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies. To find 1/2 of a dozen, we multiply 12 by 1/2, which is the same as dividing 12 by 2. So, 12 ÷ 2 = 6.

She also received 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is 48 brownies. Since a dozen is equal to 12, we can multiply 4 by 12 to find the total number of brownies. 4 × 12 = 48.

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies Greta received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66.

Next, we need to find out how many brownies were eaten. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies. To find 1 1/2 of a dozen, we multiply 12 by 1 1/2, which is the same as multiplying 12 by 1.5. So, 12 × 1.5 = 18.

Now, let's subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies Greta received: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 × 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 × 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Given the length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to follow a step-by-step process.

First, we need to determine how many boxes of oranges she had left after giving some to her mom and sister. Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.

Now, she has 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges in 8 boxes is 8 × 20 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is (1/4) × 160 = 40 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Now, we need to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25. We know that Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find the number of hours, we can divide the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Tyler needs to work for 5 hours to afford his books."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday. We also know that he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than on Sunday. So, the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday is 15 - 4 = 11.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which means he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day.

- Total earnings on Saturday = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225
- Total earnings on Sunday = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315

To find the total earnings for two days, we add the earnings from Saturday and Sunday: 225 + 315 = 540.

The final answer is: 540"
"To figure out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she'll use. Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day, she'll reapply sunscreen 4 times a day.

She'll be on vacation for 8 days, so she'll reapply sunscreen 4 times a day for 8 days, which is 4 * 8 = 32 times.

Since each time she reapplies sunscreen, she uses 1 ounce, she'll use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of sunscreen she'll use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces) to find out how many bottles she'll need.

32 ÷ 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

The price of the blue car is $100. To find 40% of $100, we multiply 0.4 by $100.

0.4 × $100 = $40

Now, we subtract the discount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car.

Price of red car = Price of blue car - Discount
= $100 - $40
= $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The total cost of both cars is the sum of their prices:

Total cost = Price of blue car + Price of red car
= $100 + $60
= $160

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother. 

First, let's find the age of Emil's brother when Emil turns 24. Since Emil will be twice as old as his brother, we can set up the equation:

Emil's age when he turns 24 = 2 * brother's age when Emil turns 24

We know Emil's age when he turns 24 is 24, so we can rewrite the equation as:

24 = 2 * brother's age when Emil turns 24

To find the brother's age, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

brother's age when Emil turns 24 = 24 / 2
brother's age when Emil turns 24 = 12

Since Emil is 5 years younger than 24, his brother is also 5 years younger than 12. So, his brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

Now, let's find the age of Emil's dad when Emil turns 24. We know Emil will be half the age of his dad, so we can set up the equation:

Emil's age when he turns 24 = 1/2 * dad's age when Emil turns 24

We know Emil's age when he turns 24 is 24, so we can rewrite the equation as:

24 = 1/2 * dad's age when Emil turns 24

To find the dad's age, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

dad's age when Emil turns 24 = 24 * 2
dad's age when Emil turns 24 = 48

Since Emil is 5 years younger than 24, his dad is also 5 years older than 48. So, his dad's current age is 48 + 5 = 53 years old.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is 53 + 7 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads. 
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (mother) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught and then divide that by the serving size.

First, let's calculate the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day. On Thursday, he caught 3 pounds. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how many students are leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can calculate this by multiplying 0.2 by the total number of students, which is 30.

0.2 * 30 = 6

So, there are 6 football players.

Now, let's find the number of cheerleaders or band members. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or band members, we need to first find the number of remaining students. We can do this by subtracting the number of football players from the total number of students.

30 - 6 = 24

Now, we can calculate the number of cheerleaders or band members by multiplying 0.25 by the number of remaining students.

0.25 * 24 = 6

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders or band members.

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie, we need to add their shoe sizes and divide by 2.

Sophie's shoe size is 5. 
Charlie's shoe size is 5 times Sophie's, so it is 5 * 5 = 25.

The sum of their shoe sizes is 5 + 25 = 30.
The average shoe size is 30 / 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to first figure out how many plants she can fit in her flower bed.

The flower bed is 111 feet long, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the flower bed to inches: 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

We need to subtract the width of the plant (12 inches) and the space between the plants (18 inches) from the total length of the flower bed for each plant. Let's denote the number of plants as 'n'. The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is 1320 - 30n.

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 'n - 17' more flowers. The total cost of the flowers will be the number of flowers she needs to buy multiplied by the cost of each flower, which is (n - 17) * 6.

We know that the total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is equal to the width of the plant (12 inches) multiplied by the number of plants (n). So, we can set up the equation: 12n = 1320 - 30n.

To solve for 'n', we can add 30n to both sides of the equation: 42n = 1320. Then, we can divide both sides by 42: n = 1320 / 42 = 31.4286. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 31 plants.

Now that we know Pat needs 31 - 17 = 14 more flowers, we can calculate the total cost: 14 * 6 = 84.

The final answer is: $84"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of 18. 

1/2 of 18 = 18 ÷ 2 = 9

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 × 7 = 63

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost of filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the petunias. We have 5 baskets, and each basket needs 3 petunias. The cost of each petunia is $3.00. So, the total cost of petunias is 5 x 3 x 3 = $45.00.

Next, we need to find the cost of the sweet potato vines. We have 5 baskets, and each basket needs 2 vines. The cost of each vine is $2.50. So, the total cost of sweet potato vines is 5 x 2 x 2.50 = $25.00.

Now, we add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together to find the total cost. $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

First, let's find out how much soil the sunflowers need. Since each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil and they're planting 4 sunflowers, we multiply 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

Next, we calculate the soil needed for the carnations. Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they're planting 10 carnations, so we multiply 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

Now, we add the soil needed for the sunflowers and carnations: 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

They have a 30-pound bag of soil, so we subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total: 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, we can plant 3 roses.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she saves each month and then multiply that by 12.

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month. To find 25% of her paycheck, we multiply $2,000.00 by 0.25 (since 25% is the same as 0.25). 

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

This means Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month. To find out how many months are in a year, we know there are 12 months in a year.

Now, we multiply the monthly savings by the number of months in a year to find the total savings in a year: $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so we need to divide the total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

First, let's find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, to cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 = 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we need to find the maximum time between the two tasks. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The maximum time is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to figure out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet and then subtract that from the age at which Bill saw the comet for the second time.

Let's start by finding out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet. We know that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Since Bill was 30 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, we can set up an equation to find his dad's age at that time.

Let x be the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet. Then, 3x = 30, since Bill was three times that age when he saw the comet for the second time. To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

3x = 30
x = 30 / 3
x = 10

So, Bill's dad was 10 years old when he saw the comet.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time. This means that Bill was born 75 years after his dad saw the comet. To find Bill's age when his dad was born, we subtract 75 from his dad's age when he saw the comet:

10 (Bill's dad's age when he saw the comet) - 75 = -65 (Bill's age when his dad was born)

However, since age can't be negative, this doesn't make sense. Let's re-evaluate our approach.

We know that the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. This means that 75 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet. To find Bill's age when his dad was 30, we need to find out how many times the comet has orbited the sun since Bill's dad saw it.

Let's call the number of times the comet has orbited the sun since Bill's dad saw it ""n"". Then, the total time that has passed since Bill's dad saw the comet is 75n years. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was 30 years old when the comet had orbited the sun n times.

We also know that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. This means that Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time that has passed since Bill's dad saw the comet is a multiple of 75. Let's call this time 75n. Then, the time that has passed since Bill saw the comet for the second time is 75n + 75.

We know that Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, so we can set up an equation to find n:

75n + 75 = 90

To solve for n, we subtract 75 from both sides of the equation:

75n = 15

Then, we divide both sides of the equation by 75:

n = 15 / 75
n = 1/5

However, n must be a whole number, since it represents the number of times the comet has orbited the sun. This means that our initial assumption that the time that has passed since Bill's dad saw the comet is 75n is incorrect.

75n + 75 = 90

To solve for n, we subtract 75 from both sides of the equation:

75n = 15

Then, we divide both sides of the equation by 75:

n = 15 / 75
n = 1/5

However, n must be a whole number, since it represents the number of times the comet has orbited the sun. This means that our initial assumption that the time that has passed since Bill's dad saw the comet is 75n is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate our approach.

We know that the comet orbits the sun every "
"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and add them together.

First, let's think about the checks he writes for his bills. He pays his electric bill once a month, so that's 12 checks per year. He also pays his gas bill once a month, which is another 12 checks per year.

Next, we need to consider the checks he writes to the church. He gives money to the church twice a month, so that's 24 checks per year.

Lastly, we have the checks he writes to the pest and lawn service. They get a check every 3 months, which means he writes 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add up all the checks: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the first plane makes a total of x flights per day. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the total number of flights made by the first plane by multiplying 44 by 2. 

x = 2 * 44
x = 88

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. To find the number of flights to Greece, we multiply the total number of flights by 3/4.

Flights to Greece = (3/4) * 88
Flights to Greece = 66

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. To find the number of flights to France, we subtract the number of flights to Greece from the total number of flights and divide the result by 2.

Flights to France = (1/2) * (88 - 66)
Flights to France = (1/2) * 22
Flights to France = 11

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Let's start by finding out how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, we can calculate the amount his father gave him as 2 * $6 = $12.

Now, we add the amount his mother gave him to the amount his father gave him to find the total amount of money he received from his parents: $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we can find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings by subtracting the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the total age of the children is 20, and we have the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, which are 3 and 4, respectively. We need to find the age of Wilfred.

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. The total age of the children can be expressed as:
3 + 4 + Helene's age + W = 20

We also know that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is (3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4.

Helene's age is twice the average age, so we can write:
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)

To simplify the equation, let's multiply both sides by 4:
4 * Helene's age = 2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)
2 * Helene's age = 14 + 2W

Now, let's isolate Helene's age:
2 * Helene's age - 2W = 14
Helene's age - W = 7

Now we can substitute Helene's age in the first equation:
3 + 4 + (Helene's age - W) + W = 20
7 + Helene's age = 20
Helene's age = 13

Now that we know Helene's age, we can substitute it back into the equation Helene's age - W = 7:
13 - W = 7
W = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend donates $200, but this is not included in the amount that the lawyer will multiply by 3. The lawyer will only consider the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund.

So, the amount the lawyer will multiply by 3 = $2000

The lawyer will donate 3 times this amount, which is 3 × $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find out how many people were in the church next door, we need to first find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. To find 1/2 of 1500, we can multiply 1500 by 1/2, which is the same as dividing 1500 by 2. 

1500 / 2 = 750

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the total watermelon is 100 units. Since each kid gets a slice that is half the size of each adult's slice, we can represent the amount each kid gets as x and the amount each adult gets as 2x.

The total amount of watermelon given to the kids is 4x (4 kids * x units each). The total amount given to the adults is 2x (2 adults * 2x units each).

Since the total watermelon is 100 units, we can set up the equation: 4x + 2x = 100.

Combine like terms: 6x = 100.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 100 / 6 = 16.67.

Now that we know each kid gets 16.67 units, each adult gets 2x = 2 * 16.67 = 33.33 units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (33.33 / 100) * 100 = 33.33%.

The final answer is: 33.33"
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he works.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds. He has 9 inpatients and each round takes 20 minutes. So, the total time spent on rounds is 9 x 20 = 180 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments and each appointment takes 30 minutes. So, the total time spent on appointments is 10 x 30 = 300 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on rounds and appointments to get the total time spent on these activities: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours.

Now, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total hours he works: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

To be ready to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time required from the desired serving time. Since we're working with hours, we'll convert 5:00 pm to a 24-hour clock: 5:00 pm = 17:00.

17:00 - 3 hours = 14:00

So, Jordan should start making the cake at 2:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the number of sessions in a month is 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month. So, the total earnings per month are $40 * 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Peter and Martha have the same number of chocolate bars in each box, but the total number of chocolate bars they have is different.

Let's start by finding out how many chocolate bars are in each box for Peter and Martha. We can do this by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we do this next:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, we can express this as an equation: blue = red + 5. Substituting the value of red, we get blue = 9 + 5 = 14.

Now, we're given that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. This can be expressed as an equation: yellow = blue - 3. Substituting the value of blue, we get yellow = 14 - 3 = 11.

To find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: total = red + blue + yellow = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

"To find the number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old, which means there are 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16. Since one-fourth of these students are male, we can find the number of male students over 16 by dividing 1500 by 4, which equals 375. Therefore, the number of female students over 16 is 1500 - 375 = 1125.

Next, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which also equals 1500 students. Since one-half of these students are male, we can find the number of male students under 16 by dividing 1500 by 2, which equals 750. Therefore, the number of female students under 16 is 1500 - 750 = 750.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16, which equals 1125 + 750 = 1875.

"To find out how much water is left in the tank, we need to figure out how much water was pumped into it. 

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. 

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Maria's power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours. After that, it loses 7% of its capacity each hour for the next 3 hours. We're given that the final charge remaining is 28%.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x. After 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

Now, for the next 3 hours, the charge remaining is 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%. However, we know that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the 34% remaining after 8 hours is reduced to 28% after the last 3 hours.

To find the charge remaining after 8 hours, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the last 3 hours. Let's call the charge remaining after 8 hours y. Then, the charge lost in the last 3 hours is y - 28%. We know that the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 34% - 28% = 6%.

So, we can set up the equation: y - 28% = 6%. Solving for y, we get y = 34%.

Now, we know that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34%. We also know that the charge remaining after 5 hours is 55%. To find the initial charge, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the first 5 hours.

The charge lost in the first 5 hours is 55% - 34% = 21%. So, we can set up the equation: x - 21% = 34%. Solving for x, we get x = 55%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 55%.

Janet makes $10 an hour from her wages and $15 an hour from tips. So, her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Now, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. To find 20% of $10,000, we multiply $10,000 by 0.2. This is the same as multiplying $10,000 by 1/5, which is $2,000.

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we divide the amount she needs to save ($2,000) by her weekly earnings ($1,000).

$2,000 ÷ $1,000 = 2

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find out how many plums Jamaar can buy with the money he has left after purchasing the other fruits.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 × $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 × $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 × $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 × $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so we subtract the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased from his initial amount of money to find out how much he has left:
$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Now, we need to find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining money. Plums cost $0.25 each, so we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 ÷ $0.25 = 3

Now, we need to divide the number of packs she gave away by the number of friends. Each friend received 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we can multiply 1.3 packs by 60 to find out how many pieces each friend received. 

1.3 packs = 1 pack + 0.3 packs
1 pack has 60 pieces, so 0.3 packs have 0.3 * 60 = 18 pieces.

So, each friend received 60 + 18 = 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

The original price of carrots is $120. To find the increase in price, we multiply the original price by 5% (or 0.05). 

Year 1: 
Increase in price = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Increase in price = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Increase in price = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

"To solve this problem, we need to use algebra. Let's start by setting up the equations.

Let's say the number of small stuffed animals sold is 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals sold is 'y'. We know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4 and the price of a large stuffed animal is $12, since it's three times the price of a small one.

We also know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: x = 2y.

The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation: 4x + 12y = 120.

Since x = 2y, we can substitute this into the equation: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since x = 2y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave a total of:
2 * $10 = $20

Now, let's subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings:
$320 - $20 = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we need to subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the remaining unfound eggs from the total number of eggs.

Let's break it down step by step:

Total number of eggs = 100
Number of eggs found by the Smith twins = 30 * 2 = 60 (since there are two Smith twins)
Remaining unfound eggs = 10

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs found by the friends:
Eggs found by the friends = Total number of eggs - (Number of eggs found by the Smith twins + Remaining unfound eggs)
= 100 - (60 + 10)
= 100 - 70
= 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to first determine how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.

A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

Now, let's calculate how much ore he can mine with a steel pickaxe. A steel pickaxe allows him to mine 50% more ore than an iron pickaxe. To find 50% of 24 pounds, we multiply 24 by 0.5, which is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Since there are 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes, we multiply 36 pounds by 40 to find out how much ore they can mine in a day: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

To find out how much ore they can mine in a month, we multiply 1440 pounds by 30 days: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages.

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is 3/2 = $1.50. The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is 6/4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. We can use this information to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches.

Let's multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package: 1.50 * 8 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month for the bedroom set, we need to calculate the remaining balance after he sells his old bedroom set and then find 10% of that amount.

First, let's find the remaining balance:

Total cost of bedroom set: $3000
Amount paid from selling old bedroom set: $1000
Remaining balance: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, we need to find 10% of the remaining balance, which is the monthly payment:

Remaining balance: $2000
Interest rate: 10% = 0.10
Monthly payment: $2000 × 0.10 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

First, let's start with the initial number of balloons: 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow.

1. 40% of the red balloons burst:
   Number of red balloons that burst = 0.4 * 25 = 10
   Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15

2. Half of the yellow balloons were released:
   Number of yellow balloons released = 1/2 * 12 = 6
   Number of yellow balloons remaining = 12 - 6 = 6

3. 75% of the blue balloons were added:
   Number of blue balloons added = 0.75 * 8 = 6
   Total number of balloons now = 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 34

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can get, we need to subtract the number of reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates and faculty = 950
Available seats = Total capacity - Reserved seats
Available seats = 6000 - 950
Available seats = 5050

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5050 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5.32

Since we can't give a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the question asks for the number of tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, implying that the remaining tickets are for guests.

Therefore, the answer is 5 tickets per graduate."
"To find out how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first determine how many medium-sized beans he can eat, and then figure out how many small beans are equivalent to that amount.

Since it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, we can calculate the number of medium-sized beans he can eat by multiplying the number of large beans by 2. 

75 large beans * 2 = 150 medium-sized beans

Now, we need to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can set up a proportion to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans.

Let's say x is the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Then, 3x = 150 (since 3 small beans = 1 medium-sized bean). 

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 150 / 3 = 50.

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

The final answer is: 50"
"So, Melissa is on jury duty and she's getting paid for it. She works 6 hours a day for 3 days. She gets $15 per day, but she has to pay $3 for parking each day. We need to figure out how much she makes per hour after expenses.

First, let's find out how much she makes in total. She gets $15 per day for 3 days, so that's 3 x $15 = $45. But she has to pay $3 for parking each day, so that's 3 x $3 = $9. To find out how much she has left after expenses, we subtract the expenses from her total earnings: $45 - $9 = $36.

Now, we need to find out how many hours she worked in total. She works 6 hours a day for 3 days, so that's 6 x 3 = 18 hours.

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she worked: $36 ÷ 18 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils, then add them together.

The cost of 3 books is 3 x $16 = $48.

Now, we add the cost of the books and the pencils together: $48 + $18 = $66.

So, Ted spent a total of $66."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to find the total number of soda bottles and multiply it by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:

8 bottles * 5 seconds = 40 seconds

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we need to first find out how many apples he has in total. Since he ordered two boxes of apples, and each box has 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box: 2 * 40 = 80 apples.

Now, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Each pack has 8 apples. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack: 80 ÷ 8 = 10.

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Amor will have left after buying cheese, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 × $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 × $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so after buying the cheese, she will have $50 - $40 = $10 left.

The final answer is: $10"
"So, let's break down the problem. Jim gets a $50,000 loan each year for 4 years, which is a total of $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000. He also loses money by not working while in college, which is $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000. So, he needs to earn a total of $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so he now makes $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year. To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 ÷ $75,000/year = 4 years

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width, so the area of one piece is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. To find one-fifth of 425, we divide 425 by 5: 425 ÷ 5 = 85. Then, we add 17 to this result: 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. To find twice as many as Tuesday, we multiply 102 by 2: 102 × 2 = 204. Then, we add 5 to this result: 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken salad. We multiply the number of people who want the chicken salad (10) by the cost per person ($6.50). This gives us 10 x $6.50 = $65.

Next, we find the cost of the pasta salad. We multiply the number of people who want the pasta salad (6) by the cost per person ($6). This gives us 6 x $6 = $36.

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together to find the total cost. $65 + $36 = $101.

The final answer is: $101"
"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races.

First, let's calculate the amount lost in the first race: -$5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, the amount won in the second race is 2 * (-$5) + $1 = -$9.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, the amount lost in the third race is 1.5 * (-$9) = -$13.50.

Now, let's calculate the total loss: -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.50) = -$27.50.

The number of races is 3.

To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races: -$27.50 / 3 = -$9.17.

The final answer is: $9.17"
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

First, we multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country: 26 * 5 = 130
Then, we multiply the result by the population per city: 130 * 1000 = 130,000

The total population of South America is 130,000 people.

The final answer is: 130000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their current heights. 

First, let's convert Xavier's height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches by multiplying 4 by 12.

Xavier's height in inches = 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
Xavier's new height = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Now, let's calculate Cole's new height. We know that Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer.

Cole's new height = 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier by subtracting Xavier's height from Cole's height.

Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height
Difference = 52 inches - 51 inches
Difference = 1 inch

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To find the share of the first person, let's denote the first person's share as x. The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is x + 80. The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

The first person's share is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's find out how many days are in 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 3 by 7 to get 21 days.

Now, we need to find out how many hours they worked each day. They worked 3/8ths of a day, and there are 24 hours in a day. To find 3/8ths of 24, we multiply 24 by 3 and then divide by 8. This is the same as multiplying 24 by 3 and then multiplying by 1/8. So, we can multiply 24 by 3 and then divide by 8.

24 * 3 = 72
72 / 8 = 9

So, they worked 9 hours each day. Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Rory retrieved a total of 19 tennis balls in all. In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set. Let's call the number of balls retrieved in the second set ""x"". 

So, in the first set, he retrieved x + 4 balls. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, which is x/2.

We can write an equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To simplify the equation, we can multiply every term by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. This means that 79% of the car's value remains at the end of each year.

Year 2008:
Price in 2008 = Initial price * 0.79
= $20,000 * 0.79
= $15,800

Year 2009:
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 * 0.79
= $15,800 * 0.79
= $12,472

Year 2010:
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 * 0.79
= $12,472 * 0.79
= $9,851.68

The final answer is: $9851.68"
"To find the number of Spanish books in the library, we need to first determine the number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the books are written in English, so the number of English books is 50 / 2 = 25.
10% of the books are written in German, so the number of German books is 50 * 0.1 = 5.

The total number of books written in English and German is 25 + 5 = 30.
Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

The total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is 1955 kilometers. Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days. To find the remaining distance, we'll subtract the distance she drove from the total distance.

Distance left to drive = Total distance - Distance driven
= 1955 - 325
= 1630 kilometers

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

The final answer is: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in that time period.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find the total cups in 30 days, we multiply the number of cups she drinks per day by the number of days:

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to convert cups to gallons. There are 16 cups in a gallon. To do this, we divide the total cups by the number of cups in a gallon:

240 cups ÷ 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to calculate the number of people at each stop and add them up.

Let's start with the initial number of people on the train, which is 120.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
120 + 20 = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
140 - 50 + 100 = 190

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
190 - 80 = 110

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To find out how much Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the tank top, which is $10. 

Next, we need to find the cost of the running shorts. Since they cost $5 more than the tank top, we can add $5 to the cost of the tank top: $10 + $5 = $15.

Now, let's find the cost of the tennis shoes. They were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. To find the sale price, we can divide the original price by 2: $48 ÷ 2 = $24.

The athletic socks cost $8, but Alison had a coupon for $2 off. To find the final cost of the socks, we can subtract the coupon value from the original price: $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

The final answer is: $55"
"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Next, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt and each tile covers 1 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost of James' insurance, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

First, we find 60% of $120 by multiplying 0.6 by $120: 0.6 × $120 = $72. 

Now, we add this to the normal cost: $120 + $72 = $192. 

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply it by 12: $192 × 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
- 4 twin beds = 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets
- 1 king size bed = 1 king sheet
- Total sheets = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week.
- 3 sets * 1 load/set = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and multiply it by 4.

They watch 4 movies on Saturday. 
They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday, so they watch 4 / 2 = 2 movies on Sunday.

In one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

In 4 weeks, they watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he collected over the past three years.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, we add the stickers from all three years: 100 + 150 + 100 = 350 stickers.

However, let's break it down step by step:

1. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
2. Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
3. This year, he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

So, the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is 100 + 150 + 100 = 350 stickers.

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food each cat eats per day. Since Imma feeds her cats twice a day, we need to multiply the daily amount of cat food per cat by 2.

The amount of cat food each cat eats per day is 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams.

Now, let's divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount each cat eats per day (120 grams): 720 ÷ 120 = 6.

Therefore, the cat food will last for 6 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared 4 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 4 * 8 = 32.

We're also given that Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can find out how many slices Jake ate by subtracting 3 from Becky's total: 10 - 3 = 7.

Now, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. So, Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia, we add their individual totals: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the time Betsy's part took, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, which is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x is the time Donovan's part took, and Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the visit. The doctor charges $300 per hour, and the visit is 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

Next, we need to find the cost of the painkillers. The doctor charges $4 per pill, and Hannah needs 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of the cast is $200, and the cost of parking is $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add the costs together:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The final answer is: $482"
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we need to first figure out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. 

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, in a 5-day work week, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests: 380 ÷ 4 = 95.

The average score is 95."
"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to figure out how many the glee club and the football team ate, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 0.7 by 20. That's 0.7 × 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 × 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 × 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total cost for the small coupons. We know that Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons, and each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of small coupons by the cost per small coupon:

700 small coupons * 5 cents/coupon = 700 * 5 = 3500 cents

Next, we need to find the total cost for the big coupons. We know that Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he wants to send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of big coupons by the cost per big coupon:

1400 big coupons * 15 cents/coupon = 1400 * 15 = 21000 cents

Now, we add the total cost of the small coupons and the big coupons to find the total cost of postage:

3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100:

24500 cents / 100 = 245 dollars

"To find out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered, we need to subtract 3 from 10.

10 - 3 = 7

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, we can find the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches by multiplying 7 by 4.

7 × 4 = 28

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so we need to subtract 4 from 7 to find out how many sub sandwiches are left.

7 - 4 = 3

Sidney then ordered 3 more sub sandwiches, so we add 3 to the remaining 3 sub sandwiches.

3 + 3 = 6

Now, we need to find the total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches. We can do this by multiplying 6 by 4.

6 × 4 = 24

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks carrying 20 tons of fertiliser each. We need to find out how many tons of fertiliser reached the farmers.

First, we need to find out how many trucks had mechanical failures. A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, so we multiply 20 by 1/4 to find the number of trucks that failed.

20 trucks * (1/4) = 20 * 0.25 = 5 trucks

Now, we subtract the number of trucks that failed from the total number of trucks to find the number of trucks that reached the farmers.

20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks

Since each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, we multiply the number of trucks that reached the farmers by 20 to find the total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers.

15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons

"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion. 

Since Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen, he needs 6 pounds of butter. 

The promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, so for every 2 pounds of butter, he pays the full price of $4.00 for one pound and half off for the other pound. 

For 6 pounds of butter, he will need to buy 3 sets of 2 pounds. 

The cost for 3 sets of 2 pounds of butter is:
- 3 sets * $4.00 (full price) = $12.00
- 3 sets * $2.00 (half off) = $6.00
- Total cost for 6 pounds of butter = $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests and multiply it by the cost per guest, then add the initial fee.

First, let's find the total number of guests attending the party. Kayla invited her 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, as well as 13 family members. However, 4 people said they could not come. So, the total number of guests attending is 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests. The number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

Now, we can calculate the cost for the additional guests by multiplying the number of additional guests by the cost per guest, which is $6. So, the cost for the additional guests is 21 * 6 = $126.

Finally, we add the initial fee of $125 to the cost for the additional guests to find the total cost of the party. The total cost is $126 + $125 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her money left. Since she had $60, we can represent this as an equation: 

(3/4) * x = 60, where x is the original amount of money Maggie had. To find x, we multiply both sides by 4/3:

x = 60 * (4/3)
x = 80

So, Maggie originally had $80. Now, she has 3/4 of that amount left, which is:

(3/4) * 80 = 60

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has 2/3 of her money left. Since she had $60, we can represent this as an equation:

(2/3) * x = 60, where x is the original amount of money Riza had. To find x, we multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 60 * (3/2)
x = 90

So, Riza originally had $90. Now, she has 2/3 of that amount left, which is:

(2/3) * 90 = 60

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add the money Maggie and Riza have:

$60 + $60 = $120

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the total amount of money they have left after Maggie and Riza spent their respective portions. Maggie spent 1/4 of her money, which is $20, and Riza spent 1/3 of her money, which is $30. So, the total amount of money they spent is $20 + $30 = $50.

The amount of money they have left is the original amount minus the amount they spent: $80 + $90 - $50 = $120.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. However, we know that the total number of bananas is 315 and they last for a week, which is 7 days. 

So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315. To find the total number of bananas eaten each day, we divide 315 by 7: 

$$\frac{315}{7} = 45$$

Now we know that the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day. So, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas each day.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then determine the change she receives.

First, let's find out how much she paid for the roses. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective to buy them by the dozen. 15 roses is 1 and 3 roses. 1 dozen is 12 roses, so she bought 1 dozen and 3 individual roses.

1 dozen roses cost $15. 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total amount from each item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total amount from the milkshakes. Since Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, we multiply the number of milkshakes by the price per milkshake: 6 x $5.50 = $33.

Next, we calculate the total amount from the burger platters. Terry sells 9 burger platters for $11 each, so we multiply the number of platters by the price per platter: 9 x $11 = $99.

Finally, we calculate the total amount from the sodas. Terry sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each, so we multiply the number of sodas by the price per soda: 20 x $1.50 = $30.

Now, let's add the total amount from each item together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To find the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

First, let's find out when the first train leaves the station. It arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

Next, we need to find out when the second train arrives and leaves the station. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

Now, let's find out when the third train arrives and leaves the station. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

Finally, we need to find out when the fourth train arrives. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is 0 minutes, Paul needs to wait from 0 to 145 minutes for the fourth train. However, we need to consider the time he waits from the first train's arrival to the fourth train's arrival.

- Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train.
- He waits from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train.
- He waits from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train.
- He waits from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is the sum of these intervals: 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to first calculate how many toothpicks she has saved so far. 

She saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks, so the total number of toothpicks she saved is:
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, and she already has 120, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs:
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week:
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. Since he bought it at 75% of the original price, we multiply the original price by 0.75.

   Original price = $2000
   Price Mr. Rogers paid = 2000 * 0.75
   Price Mr. Rogers paid = $1500

2. Then, we find the price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend. He sold it at 120% of the price he bought it, so we multiply the price he paid by 1.2.

   Price Mr. Rogers sold it for = 1500 * 1.2
   Price Mr. Rogers sold it for = $1800

3. Now, we find the discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. We subtract the price he paid from the original price.

   Discount = Original price - Price Mr. Rogers' friend paid
   Discount = 2000 - 1800
   Discount = $200

4. Finally, we find the percentage discount by dividing the discount by the original price and multiplying by 100.

   Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100
   Percentage discount = (200 / 2000) * 100
   Percentage discount = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of jellyfish created, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs and the rate at which they create jellyfish per second.

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since there are 5 springs, and each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

Now, we multiply the total number of seconds by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish per second:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. Binkie bowled a score of 90, so twice that would be 2 × 90 = 180.

Now, we know that Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's score. To find Frankie's score, we add 15 to 180.

Frankie's score = 180 + 15
Frankie's score = 195

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total distance James walked, we need to calculate the distance to the store and back. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back, he walked a total of 2 * 4 = 8 miles.

Since James walks 4 miles per hour, we can find the time it took him to walk 8 miles by dividing the total distance by his speed: 

8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas both ways.

First, let's find out how many bananas Jenny bought in total. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 40 bananas individually. The cost of one banana is $0.80, so the total cost of 40 bananas is 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence between them. They agree to split it, with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam. 

Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet. 

We can set up an equation to represent the total amount of fence: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to know its growth rate per year. We can calculate this by dividing the total growth in inches by the number of years it took to achieve that growth.

Let's do the math:

Growth per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth per year = 2 inches/year

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth per year * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to know the number of each type of bike he sold and multiply it by its price.

Let's start by finding the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to figure out how many bales the farmer makes and how many the truck picks up. The farmer makes 5 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales made is 5 * 6 = 30.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales picked up is 3 * 6 = 18.

Now, we need to subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made to find out how many are left in the field: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many hours John spends learning each week, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and the extra time he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's find the total minutes John spends in class. He has 6 periods a day, and each period is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes he spends in class per day is 6 * 40 = 240 minutes. Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class per week is 240 * 5 = 1200 minutes.

John also has 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes he spends in these extra classes per day is 2 * 40 = 80 minutes. Since he has these extra classes 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in these extra classes per week is 80 * 5 = 400 minutes.

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular classes and the extra classes: 1200 minutes + 400 minutes = 1600 minutes.

Next, we need to find the total minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. To find his total weekly minutes, we multiply the minutes in a day by 7: 24 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 1440 minutes per day. So, his total weekly minutes are 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes. 1/16 of this is 10080 / 16 = 630 minutes. Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total minutes he spends on these days is 630 * 2 = 1260 minutes.

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes, and the extra minutes for Saturday and Sunday: 1600 minutes + 1260 minutes = 2860 minutes.

Finally, let's convert the total minutes to hours: 2860 minutes / 60 = 47.67 hours.

The final answer is: 47.67"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

The height of the ball after the first bounce is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

The height of the ball after the second bounce is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to convert the height of the first child to inches and then calculate the height of each child step by step.

First, we know that the first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert the height of the first child to inches by multiplying 6 by 12.

6 feet = 6 × 12 inches
= 72 inches

Now, we know that the second child is two inches taller than the first child. So, we add 2 inches to the height of the first child to find the height of the second child.

Height of second child = Height of first child + 2 inches
= 72 inches + 2 inches
= 74 inches

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child. To find the height of the third child, we subtract 5 inches from the height of the second child.

Height of third child = Height of second child - 5 inches
= 74 inches - 5 inches
= 69 inches

Finally, the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child. To find the height of the fourth child, we add 3 inches to the height of the third child.

Height of fourth child = Height of third child + 3 inches
= 69 inches + 3 inches
= 72 inches

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned from selling apples, we need to know how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by 10 to find the number of bags.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags × $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms left after the Allosaurus ate. 

First, we know that the Allosaurus ate half of what the velociraptors had. So, the velociraptors had 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex, the T-Rex must have eaten half of the original weight of the triceratops. The velociraptors had 540 kilograms, which is half of what the T-Rex ate. So, the T-Rex ate 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet.
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.
The total area of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to figure out the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Let's break it down step by step. Ellen started with 12 sodas and shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas.

Then, Ellen's brother came by and took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 14.29%."
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and add them together. 

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

The total distance between the two trains is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find out how many people Billy helps, we need to figure out how many days he actually works. We know he takes 20% of the days off between March 1st and April 19th. 

First, let's find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Now, we need to find 20% of 50, which is the number of days Billy takes off. To do this, we multiply 0.2 by 50: 
0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy works: 
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, we multiply the number of days Billy works by the number of people he can help per day to find the total number of people he helps: 
40 * 6 = 240

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people that were present. However, the question doesn't provide the total number of people present, so we'll assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since we're assuming the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported, the number of people inside the church is also 480.

"To find Jeff's age, we need to first determine Martha's age. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age by adding 10 to Martha's age, since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to ride each slide. 

The time it takes to ride a slide is calculated by dividing the length of the slide by the speed of the slide. 

For the biggest slide, which is 300 feet long and people slide down at 60 feet/minute, the time it takes is 300 / 60 = 5 minutes.

For the second biggest slide, which is 240 feet long and people slide down at 80 feet/minute, the time it takes is 240 / 80 = 3 minutes.

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides. This is done by subtracting the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide: 5 - 3 = 2 minutes.

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
The total time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.
The total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

Micah's miles = 8 × 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item and then add that to the initial charge.

First, let's subtract the $15.00 return from the initial charge of $85.00.

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, we need to find the cost of the frying pan and the towels. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the price by 0.20 (which is the same as 20%).

$20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price of the frying pan.

$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

The towels were on sale for 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply the price by 0.10 (which is the same as 10%).

$30.00 x 0.10 = $3.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price of the towels.

$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

The total cost of the new purchases is the sum of the cost of the frying pan and the towels.

$16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Finally, we add the total cost of the new purchases to the previous balance.

$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish in the tank are large, and a third of those large jellyfish change color from green to blue when exposed to UV light. The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so we can set up the equation x/15 = 6 to find the total number of jellyfish.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15:
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to use the given information about the relationships between the ages of Caroline, Ben, and Chris.

We know that Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris. This can be expressed as:

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3, since Caroline is three times older than Ben:

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To figure out how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to know how much money she needs to save for retirement and how much she can save each year.

Lauren's current salary is $100,000 per year. She plans to save 20% of that, which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current salary in retirement, which is 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year. Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, she needs to save enough money to cover 20 years of $40,000, which is $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Now, we need to divide the total amount she needs to save ($800,000) by the amount she saves each year ($20,000) to find out how many years it will take her to save that much.

$800,000 ÷ $20,000 = 40 years

Since Lauren hasn't worked any years yet, she needs to work for 40 years to save enough money for retirement.

"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into, and then divide that result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into.

First, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into: 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Then, we divide the result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into: 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to use the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the students are boys, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship.

Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. We know that 40% of 'x' equals 240 boys. To find 'x', we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40% = 40/100 = 0.4.

Now, we can set up the equation: 0.4x = 240

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.4: x = 240 / 0.4

x = 600

This means the total number of students in the school is 600. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we can multiply the total number of students by the decimal equivalent of 60%: 0.6 * 600 = 360

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school."
"To find out how much money my mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and then subtract the discount she received.

First, let's add the cost of the pots and the garden soil:

Cost of pots: $19
Cost of garden soil: $26
Total cost before discount = $19 + $26 = $45

Next, we need to subtract the discount from the total cost:

Discount: $7
Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount

So, my mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to add up the total height of all the heels and divide it by the total number of women.

There are 3 women wearing 4 inch heels and 3 women wearing 2 inch heels. 

The total height of the 4 inch heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of the 2 inch heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the total number of women: 18 ÷ 6 = 3 inches.

The average height of heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To figure out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we need to know how many days she has to hike and how many miles she can hike in that time. June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since Soledad only has 30 days in June, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we need to calculate the total miles she can hike in 30 days at 250 miles per day: 250 * 30 = 7,500 miles.

The difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the miles she can hike in 30 days is 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the difference by the number of days: 1,800 / 30 = 60 miles per day.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total amount the store will receive from selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of ball and add them together.

First, let's calculate the revenue from each type of ball:

Red balls: 3 balls * $9 per ball = $27
Blue balls: 11 balls * $5 per ball = $55
Green balls: 25 balls * $3 per ball = $75

Now, let's add the revenues together to find the total amount the store will receive:

$27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will receive a total of $157 from selling all the balls."
"To find out how much James will have left, we need to determine how much Pierre and Paul will take. 

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 × 1/4 = 3 kg. 
Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 × 1/3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul will take 3 + 4 = 7 kg in total.

Now, to find out how much James will have left, we subtract the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul from the initial amount: 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to calculate the change in temperature. The temperature dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight, and then it increased by 3 degrees Celsius in the morning.

Let's use a simple equation to find the temperature in the morning:

Initial temperature = 2°C
Temperature drop = -8°C (since it dropped)
Temperature increase = 3°C

Temperature in the morning = Initial temperature + Temperature drop + Temperature increase
= 2 - 8 + 3
= -3

So, the temperature in the morning was -3°C.

The final answer is: -3"
"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount he had.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Raymond initially had $21.
2. He saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.
3. He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.
4. He spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left.

The final answer is: $8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. After buying the 2 books, she had $2 left, which means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2.

$$\frac{\$10}{2} = \$5$$

So, each book cost $5."
"To find the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment and add it to the previous year's enrollment.

The previous year's enrollment was 50 students. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.20.

50 × 0.20 = 10

Now, we add the increase to the previous year's enrollment: 50 + 10 = 60

So, the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year is 60.

60"
"To find out how long it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to know the rate at which it blinks per minute. We're given that it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

First, let's find the rate per minute by dividing the number of blinks by the number of minutes:
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:
459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we need to calculate the total number of male and female fishes.

First, let's find the total number of male guppies and goldfishes. Tate initially had 4 male guppies and 3 male goldfishes. He bought 2 more male guppies and 2 more male goldfishes. So, the total number of male guppies is 4 + 2 = 6, and the total number of male goldfishes is 3 + 2 = 5. Therefore, the total number of male fishes is 6 + 5 = 11.

Next, let's find the total number of female guppies and goldfishes. Tate initially had 7 female guppies and 5 female goldfishes. He bought 1 more female guppy and 3 more female goldfishes. So, the total number of female guppies is 7 + 1 = 8, and the total number of female goldfishes is 5 + 3 = 8. Therefore, the total number of female fishes is 8 + 8 = 16.

Now, to find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes: 16 - 11 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time taken by each person and add them together.

First, let's find the time taken by Amalia, Megan, and Dior to complete their chores. Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours.

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add the time taken by each person to find the total time: 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours.

"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of a one-way trip and multiply it by 2.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the total distance by 2:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

The final answer is: 560"
"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can multiply the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days she will be walking. 

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks. To find half of 70 miles, we can divide 70 by 2.

70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 4 workers who produce toys at different rates. 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. They all work for 10 hours. 

First, let's find the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers in 10 hours. The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour will produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys. The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour will produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys. 

So, the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers in 10 hours is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 400 + 20 = 420 toys. This means the fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys, which is 420 - 200 = 220 toys.

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour is 220 / 10 = 22 toys per hour.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to find the weight of each of his dogs and add them together.

First, we know that Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. To find one-fourth of 60, we can divide 60 by 4. 

60 ÷ 4 = 15

So, Elijah's first dog weighs 15 pounds.

Next, we know that Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. To find half of 60, we can divide 60 by 2.

60 ÷ 2 = 30

So, Elijah's second dog weighs 30 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah's dogs is 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weight of Elijah's dogs to the weight of Kory's dog.

45 (Elijah's dogs) + 60 (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To find out how many stickers Seth had in the beginning, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that Kris had 7 stickers, and that's half of what Luis had. 

Let's call the number of stickers Luis had ""L"". Since Kris had half of Luis's stickers, we can write an equation: 7 = L/2. To solve for L, we multiply both sides by 2, which gives us L = 14.

Now that we know Luis had 14 stickers, we can find out how many stickers Seth had. Since Luis had half of Seth's stickers, we can write another equation: 14 = S/2, where S is the number of stickers Seth had. To solve for S, we multiply both sides by 2, which gives us S = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the total number of M&M's, we need to multiply the number of large bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply by the number of M&M's per ounce.

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Since each small bag contains 10 M&M's, we can divide the total number of M&M's by 10 to find the number of small bags.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. The circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. 

Half of the circumference of the earth is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can divide the total distance (20,000 km) by the distance he flies per day (400 km) to find out how many days it will take him to fly that distance.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow a step-by-step approach. 

First, we know that the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we multiply 120 by 5 to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car: 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find the speed of the faster car. We are told that the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the faster car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25: 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

Therefore, the faster car can go 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find Vince's current age, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let's represent Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Then, two years ago, Liam's age would be 2x.

Since Liam is 16 years old now, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. We can set up an equation to represent the relationship between Liam's and Vince's ages two years ago:

2x = 14

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 14 / 2
x = 7

This means that two years ago, Vince was 7 years old. To find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago:

Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 easter eggs. We also know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so we can say A = M.

We're also given that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. This can be represented as C + S = 30 and C = S + 12.

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get S + 12 + S = 30, which simplifies to 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives 2S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substituting the values of A, M, C, and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combining like terms gives 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2A = 26.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the total weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So the total weight of the crayons is 200 × 1 = 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 200 crayons, we need to find out how many boxes he will need. To do this, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 ÷ 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, we can find the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 25 × 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 ÷ 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes from cutting down the tree, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet, we divide 64 by 4 to find the number of logs.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 * 1.2 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to add up their individual salaries.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns twice as much as Valerie, so he earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month. 

Now, let's find their combined salary: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach and the sidewalk. 

Let's assume the speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes. 

The time spent on the beach can be calculated as distance/speed = 2/x. This is equal to 40 minutes. So, 2/x = 40.

Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

Now, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. The distance is 1 mile and the speed is 1/10 miles per minute. So, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save $60, we need to calculate how much she has saved so far and then determine how much more she needs to save.

First, let's calculate the total amount she has saved in 8 weeks:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 ÷ $4/week = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. So, Bob will have 60 + 24 = 84 marbles after receiving 2 dozen more marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has before receiving 2 dozen more marbles. Let's call the number of marbles Bob has before receiving 2 dozen more marbles 'x'. Then, x + 24 = 84. To find 'x', we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: x = 84 - 24 = 60.

Now that we know Bob has 60 marbles before receiving 2 dozen more marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from 60: 60 - 10 = 50.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's say the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces. 

The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle). 

The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2. 

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2 * 5. 

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up the inequality (33 + x) / 2 * 5 ≥ 40. 

Solving for x, we get:

(33 + x) / 2 * 5 ≥ 40
(33 + x) * 5 / 2 ≥ 40
(33 + x) * 5 ≥ 80
165 + 5x ≥ 80
5x ≥ 80 - 165
5x ≥ -85
x ≥ -85 / 5
x ≥ -17

However, the problem asks for the minimum temperature of the second bottle, so we need to find the minimum value of x that satisfies the condition. 

Since x cannot be negative, the minimum value of x is 40 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total number of cows. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows

Next, let's find the total number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we need to first calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels and then apply the 10% discount. 

The cost of one pack of bagels is $10.00, and there are 4 packs, so the total cost is 4 x $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00 and subtract it from the total cost. 
10% of $40.00 = 0.1 x $40.00 = $4.00
Discounted cost = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Each pack has 9 bagels, and Russell orders 4 packs, so the total number of bagels is 4 x 9 = 36.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we need to divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels.
Cost of each single bagel = $36.00 / 36 = $1.00

"To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. It's given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we can write this as an equation: scoops = 23 - 5. 

scoops = 23 - 5
scoops = 18

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. It's given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. Let's first find out how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is: 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 2 scoops. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops. Since we want to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop, we can divide the number of potatoes by 2: 3 / 2 = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now that we know it takes 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop, we can find out how many potatoes Gomer ate by multiplying the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop: 18 * 1.5 = 27.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he eats in that time period.

First, let's find out how many eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days. Since he eats 3 eggs a day, we multiply 3 by 30.

3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

Next, we find out how many eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days. Since he increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day, we multiply 5 by 30.

5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the number of eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs.

90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first figure out how many bouquets and sunflowers he sold per day.

Let's start by finding out how many bouquets he sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from the bouquets per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to get the number of bouquets sold per day.

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply the number of bouquets sold per day by 12 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets.

7 bouquets/day × 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers/day

Now, let's find out how many sunflowers he sold per day from the individual sunflowers. Since each sunflower costs $2 and he earned $26 from the sunflowers per day, we can divide $26 by $2 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day.

$26 ÷ $2 = 13 sunflowers/day

Now, we can add the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets and the individual sunflowers to get the total number of sunflowers sold per day.

84 sunflowers/day + 13 sunflowers/day = 97 sunflowers/day

Finally, we can multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by the number of days to get the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

97 sunflowers/day × 3 days = 291 sunflowers

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

$$\frac{\$100}{\$5} = 20$$

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks:

$$0.6 \times 20 = 12$$

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

$$12 \times \$7 = \$84$$

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:

$$20 \times \$5 = \$100$$

Since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

$$8 \times \$5 = \$40$$

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$$\$100 + \$40 = \$140$$

However, Adam only made $84 from selling the rocks. To find out how much money he loses, we subtract the revenue from the total cost:

$$\$140 - \$84 = \$56$$

The final answer is: $56"
"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to figure out how many days it will take her to draw each type of picture scene and then find the maximum of these values.

First, let's calculate the number of days it will take her to draw the large-sized picture scenes. We know she can draw 5 large scenes per day, and she needs to draw 45 large scenes. To find the number of days, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day:

45 large scenes / 5 scenes per day = 45 ÷ 5 = 9 days

Next, let's calculate the number of days it will take her to draw the medium-sized picture scenes. We know she can draw 6 medium scenes per day, and she needs to draw 36 medium scenes. To find the number of days, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day:

36 medium scenes / 6 scenes per day = 36 ÷ 6 = 6 days

Finally, let's calculate the number of days it will take her to draw the small-sized picture scenes. We know she can draw 7 small scenes per day, and she needs to draw 49 small scenes. To find the number of days, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day:

49 small scenes / 7 scenes per day = 49 ÷ 7 = 7 days

Now that we have the number of days for each type of scene, we need to find the maximum of these values. The maximum of 9, 6, and 7 is 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.

Since Chatty prepared three dozen eggs, we first need to convert the dozen to a numerical value. A dozen is equal to 12, so three dozen eggs is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children: 36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs per child.

Therefore, each child receives 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for one month.

First, we need to know the number of days in May. May has 31 days. Since each fish needs $1 worth of food per day, and Jen has 3 fish, the total cost per day is 3 * $1 = $3.

To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

The final answer is: $93"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Patricia initially had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so we need to subtract 24 from 30 to find out how many roses she has left.

30 - 24 = 6

Now, Patricia bought 15 more roses. To find the total number of roses she has now, we add 15 to the number of roses she had left.

6 + 15 = 21

So, Patricia now has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

The probability of both tickets winning is 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. Let's denote the number of seashells Carlos collected as C. Then, Jim collected C + 5 seashells. Since Jim collected 27 seashells, we can write the equation:

C + 5 = 27

To solve for C, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

C = 27 - 5
C = 22

Now, we know that Carlos collected 22 seashells. We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as R. Then, Carlos collected 2R seashells. We can write the equation:

2R = 22

To solve for R, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

R = 22 / 2
R = 11

Now we know that Jim collected 27 seashells, Carlos collected 22 seashells, and Carrey collected 11 seashells.

They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. The total number of seashells is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60. To find out how many seashells each person gets, we divide the total number of seashells by 3 (the number of people):

60 / 3 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). We can find the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays by multiplying the number of carrots he eats each day by the number of weekdays: 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week: 20 + 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to find the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is 60% as a decimal).

5 × 0.6 = 3 minutes

So the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes and 8 minutes. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

First, let's find the profit from Monday. Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each, so the total cost price for Monday is 2 x $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 x $20 = $40. So, the total selling price for Monday is 2 x $40 = $80. The profit for Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

Next, let's find the profit from Tuesday. Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each, so the total cost price for Tuesday is 4 x $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 x $20 = $40. So, the total selling price for Tuesday is 4 x $40 = $160. The profit for Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, we can find Carl's height by adding 1 foot to Ned's height.

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Now that we know Carl's height, we can find the length of his cane, which is half of his height.

Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to know how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person.

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

Now, to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we multiply the number of bottles needed for one person by 2300: 5 * 2300 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the number of babies wearing purple and bows, and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total (since they are octuplets).

Number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2

Number of babies wearing purple and bows: 1/3 * 6 = 2
Number of babies wearing blue and bows: 2

Total number of babies wearing bows: 2 + 2 = 4

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:

"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Let's break it down step by step:

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

First, we need to find the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. We can do this by adding the reports received on Monday and Tuesday to the reports received on Thursday and Friday.

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 1907 + 2136
Reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 4043

Now, we can find the number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - Reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The final answer is: 1125"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Abraham starts with 80 square meters of unused land. He sells half of it for $50. To find half of 80, we divide 80 by 2, which is 40 square meters.

Next, he sells another 1/4 of his land for $30. To find 1/4 of 80, we divide 80 by 4, which is 20 square meters.

Now, let's find out how much land is left. We subtract the land he sold from the total: 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sells the remaining land for $3 per square meter. To find the total amount of money he earns from this sale, we multiply the remaining land by the price per square meter: 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's add up the money he earned from all the sales. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale.

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. Since Haley is 26 years old, we can calculate half of her age by dividing 26 by 2.

26 / 2 = 13

Now, we know that Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age. To find Geb's age, we need to subtract 10 from 13.

13 - 10 = 3

So, Geb is 3 years old.

"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first find out how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

"To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we need to follow the information given. 

First, let's figure out how many eggs each person found. Lamar found 5 eggs. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so she found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, which is 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei found half as many as Charlie, so she found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found by all the people: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to know how many apartments he collects from and how much he gets paid per collection.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, which means it's 1.6 times as big (100% + 60% = 160%, or 1 + 0.6 = 1.6). 

So, the third complex has 1.6 * 400 = 640 apartments. In total, John collects from 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since John collects 3 times a week from each place, he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

Let's start with the given information:

- A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let's call the production of a 10-year-old tree 'x'. So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we need to find the production of a 10-year-old tree to calculate the production of an 8-year-old tree. We know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. 

Now we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 1000, x = 1200.

So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1200 - 200 = 1000 fruits.

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1000 + 0 + 1000 = 1550

The final answer is: 1550"
"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

First, let's find 1/5 of $100. To do this, we can divide $100 by 5.

$$\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{100}{1} = \frac{100}{5} = 20$$

Now, we add this amount to Jack's initial $100: $100 + $20 = $120.

So, Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, we need to use algebra. Let's start by denoting the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R.

We are given that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write an equation: R = 4B.

We are also given that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write another equation: B = Y - 7.

We know that the total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation: R + B + Y = 37.

Now, we can substitute R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, which gives us 4B + B + Y = 37. This simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Next, we can substitute B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, which gives us 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37. This simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Ronnie was given $5 and Rissa was given 3 times as much, which is $15.

After they both gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, which means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.

(15 - x) = (4/5) * 15
(15 - x) = 12
-x = 12 - 15
-x = -3
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with: $5 - x = $5 - 3 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. We also know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. This means that the amount of red paint is the same as the amount of white paint and the amount of purple paint.

We're also told that half the mural is yellow. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, half of it is yellow, which is 6 pints. The other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is also 6 pints.

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x. We know that this total is 6 pints, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:

$$\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{6}{3}$$

x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom. The length is 20 feet and the width is 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we can use a geometric sequence. A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.

In this case, the first term (a) is 3, and the common ratio (r) is 2, since each day Alice counts double the number of clouds from the previous day.

The formula to find the nth term of a geometric sequence is an = a * r^(n-1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number.

We want to find the sum of the first 5 terms of the sequence, so we can use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S = 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1)
S = 3 * (-31) / (-1)
S = 3 * 31
S = 93

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we need to figure out how many pods are in the new box. The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, which costs $12 for 100 pods. 

20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12 and you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 12.

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

He triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we need to divide the total amount of money by the value of each bill, which is $5. 

60 bills * $5 = $300

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 × 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is (1/4) × 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how many days he can use the chalk after Monday.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, so the remaining chalk is 55% of the original 5 inches.

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk."
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we need to determine the total number of students on varsity and then subtract that from the total number of students in the class.

First, let's find the number of girls on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we can calculate this as 12 girls * (1/3) = 4 girls on varsity.

Next, we'll find the number of boys on varsity. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so we can calculate this as 12 boys * (1/4) = 3 boys on varsity.

Now, we add the number of girls and boys on varsity to get the total number of students on varsity: 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students on varsity.

The total number of students in the class is 12 boys + 12 girls = 24 students.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students: 24 total students - 7 students on varsity = 17 students not on varsity.

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, the number of teeth the dentist caps is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100. 

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the amount of milk that was returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons. 

2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons of milk were returned.

Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the total refund will be the cost per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons returned.

Refund = 1600 * 3.5 = $5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We're given two pieces of information about Wendy and Colin's ages. Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first determine the total number of books he can buy with the money he has. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500, so we can find the cost per book by dividing the cost by the number of books.

Cost per book = $500 / 100
Cost per book = $5

Now, we can find the total number of books Bob can buy by dividing the total amount of money he has ($27000) by the cost per book ($5).

Total books = $27000 / $5
Total books = 5400

Since Bob is distributing the money to 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Books per school = Total books / Number of schools
Books per school = 5400 / 3
Books per school = 1800

The final answer is: 1800"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. This means he now has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples. So, the total number of apples he has is 1 (in pocket) + 5 (new) = 6.

Next, he put all but 1 of the new apples in his pocket, so he has 1 apple left outside and 5 apples in his pocket. The total number of apples is still 6.

Then, he threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 6 apples from the previous step and 6 new apples. To find the total number of apples, we add these two numbers together: 6 (from previous step) + 6 (new) = 12.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal by the weight per bag and multiply the result by the cost per bag.

First, let's find the number of bags of coal Ali ordered:

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to get the total cost:

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 * $18

The final answer is: $306"
"To figure out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will eat, and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36. Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is 36 / 12 = 3.

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24. Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 24 / 8 = 3.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is 3 + 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran on each day. 

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Since he ran 3 miles on each of these days, we multiply 3 miles by 3 days to get the total miles for these days: 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. Since he ran 5 miles on each of these 2 days, we multiply 5 miles by 2 days to get the total miles for these days: 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days to get the total miles Sam ran this week: 9 + 10 = 19 miles.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. So, his rate of building snowballs is 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, the rate at which they melt is 2/15 snowballs per minute.

To find the net rate of snowballs, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate: 

$$\frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{5}{15} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5}$$

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, we need to find out how long it will take to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Time = Number of snowballs / Rate = 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find Jim's age, we need to figure out how old he was 20 years ago and then add 20 to that number. 

Let's start by finding John's age 20 years ago. Since John is 28 now, we subtract 20 from his current age: 28 - 20 = 8.

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we divide John's age 20 years ago by 2 to find Jim's age 20 years ago: 8 / 2 = 4.

Now, we add 20 to Jim's age 20 years ago to find his current age: 4 + 20 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of slices each person ate and then add them up.

Let's start by identifying the number of slices each person ate. Doxa ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, which is 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, which is 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, we add up the number of slices each person ate: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the nurses used 38 bandages on the first day and ordered 1 pack of 50 bandages. This means they had 38 bandages left after the first day.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered 2 packs of 50 bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:
x = 21

So, the nurses started with 21 bandages on the first day.

The final answer is: 21"

"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her regular pay and her attendance bonus.

First, let's find her regular pay. Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 4 * 6 = 24 days in April. Her total hours worked in April is 7.5 * 24 = 180 hours. Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular pay is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

Next, let's find her attendance bonus. Jen receives an additional $10 for each day she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 24 days. Her attendance bonus is 24 * $10 = $240.

Now, let's add her regular pay and attendance bonus to find her total earnings:
Total earnings = Regular pay + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $240
Total earnings = $510

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and the number of black pens.

First, we know Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

We also know that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total of $600. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle.

Next, we're told that John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 x 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

We're also told that the cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. To find the cost per bottle of cognac, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the scotch and add it to the cost of the scotch. 50% of $60 is $60 x 0.5 = $30. So, the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + $30 = $90.

Now, we can find the total cost of the cognac by multiplying the cost per bottle by the number of bottles: 20 x $90 = $1800.

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total cost: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees separately and then add them together.

Let's start with the first day. Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days:
White Oak: 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Lodgepole Pine: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days = 30 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 120

"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer left after all the incidents and then divide it by the number of people at the party.

Let's start with the initial amount of root beer, which is 24 gallons. On the first day, 4 gallons were stolen by Fred's children, so the remaining amount is 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so the remaining amount is 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, 5 gallons were taken by Ronnie, so the remaining amount is 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

Now, we know that 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find out how much each person got, we need to divide the remaining amount by the number of people:

8 ÷ 3 = 2.67 gallons

So, each person got 2.67 gallons of root beer to drink during the party.

"To find the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge, we need to translate the given information into an equation. The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" is equal to 40. This can be written as:

4x + 8 = 40

where x is the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we can calculate this by dividing the total number of fish by 3.

Total fish = 66
Fish with red stripes = 66 ÷ 3 = 22

Now, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. We can do this by subtracting the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.

Fish without red stripes = Total fish - Fish with red stripes = 66 - 22 = 44

Next, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish, which will give us the number of fish with blue stripes.

5/11 of 44 = (5/11) × 44 = 20

Now, we can find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes by adding the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes.

Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had a total of 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had a total of 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one palette, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors. Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that Mattison's height is 60 inches. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so we can calculate the total height of the house by multiplying Mattison's height by 7:

7 × 60 = 420 inches

Next, we're told that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison. So, we can find the height of the first floor by multiplying Mattison's height by 3:

3 × 60 = 180 inches

Now, we know the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor's height is 180 inches. To find the height of the second floor, we subtract the first floor's height from the total height of the house:

420 - 180 = 240 inches

Since we want to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to find the height of the second floor to the roof. We already know the height of the second floor is 240 inches. To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to find the height of the roof to the top of the house and then subtract the height of the second floor.

The total height of the house is 420 inches, and the height of the second floor is 240 inches. To find the height of the roof to the top of the house, we subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house:

"To find the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we need to follow these steps:

First, we find the number of shells found by team Alphas, which is 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share.

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we can find the number of shells found by team Gogetters.

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)
= 700 - (280 + 252)
= 700 - 532

"To find the number of red jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the total volume of the jar and then find the number of jelly beans that can fit in it. The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base, so we can find its volume by multiplying the length, width, and height.

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans is 80% of the total volume.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, we know that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans he guessed. 

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

"To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, the bus has 200 - 180 = 20 spaces left.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is $30 + $45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine how long it will take for all students to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups required and then multiply that by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, making a total of 40 students. Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we divide the total number of students by 8 to find the number of groups: 40 ÷ 8 = 5.

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. To find the total time required for all students to try the escape room, we multiply the number of groups by the time per group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"

"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's say the length of the shorter piece is x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it's divided into two pieces. So, the sum of their lengths is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To figure out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we need to know how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed ÷ Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 ÷ 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed × Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 × 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

"To find out how much fabric Luke should buy, we need to calculate the total width of the windows and then multiply it by 2.

First, we find the total width of the windows by multiplying the width of one window by the number of windows. 

Width of one window: 35 inches
Number of windows: 5

Total width of windows = 35 * 5 = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * 175 = 350 inches

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric.

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the cost for the first 16 minutes and the cost for the remaining minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.

For the remaining 20 minutes (36 - 16 = 20), the cost is 20 * $0.2 = $4.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's say the number of cupcakes Carly made is x. Since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies is 3x - 2.

We know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Now, let's solve the equation:

x + 3x - 2 = 10
Combine like terms: 4x - 2 = 10
Add 2 to both sides: 4x = 12
Divide both sides by 4: x = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost, first, let's calculate the discount on the manicure and pedicure. 

The discount on the manicure is 20% of $35, which is 0.2 * 35 = $7. 
The discount on the pedicure is 20% of $40, which is 0.2 * 40 = $8.

The total discount is $7 + $8 = $15.

The cost of the manicure after the discount is $35 - $7 = $28.
The cost of the pedicure after the discount is $40 - $8 = $32.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $28 + $32 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90.

"To find the total number of magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them up.

First, we know that 3 magazines send 12 issues a year. So, the total number of issues from these magazines is 3 x 12 = 36.

Next, we know that one magazine sends 6 issues a year.

Lastly, we have a magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine. This means it sends 4 x 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

The final answer is: 66"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. If Samantha has 27 paintings, then Shelley must have 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

Now, we're told that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we need to subtract 8 from Shelley's total. So, Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

First, we need to find the price increase in December. The toy was originally $40, and it increased by 80%. To find 80% of $40, we multiply $40 by 0.8 (since 80% is the same as 80/100 or 0.8). 

Price increase = 0.8 * $40 = $32

Now, we add the price increase to the original price to find the new price in December.

New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

Next, we need to find the price decrease in January. The toy was $72, and it decreased by 50%. To find 50% of $72, we multiply $72 by 0.5 (since 50% is the same as 50/100 or 0.5).

Price decrease = 0.5 * $72 = $36

Now, we subtract the price decrease from the price in December to find the new price in January.

New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"So Charlie is a tennis pro, and he teaches lessons to people. He charges $80 per hour for regular lessons, but if the person is a veteran, he reduces the rate by 25%. Today, Charlie has 4 regular lessons and 2 lessons with a veteran.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money he'll make from the regular lessons. Since he has 4 lessons at $80 each, we multiply 4 by 80.

4 × 80 = 320

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he'll make from the lessons with the veteran. Since he reduces his rate by 25%, we need to find 75% of $80. To do this, we multiply 80 by 0.75.

80 × 0.75 = 60

Now, we multiply 60 by 2 to find the total amount of money he'll make from the lessons with the veteran.

2 × 60 = 120

Now, we add the total amount of money he'll make from the regular lessons and the lessons with the veteran to find the total amount of money he'll make for the day.

320 + 120 = 440

"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to figure out what 1/4 of the original amount is and then subtract that from the original amount.

Let's start with the original amount: Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos.

To find 1/4 of 20, we multiply 20 by 1/4. This can be written as:

20 × (1/4) = 20 × 1 ÷ 4 = 5

So, 1/4 of 20 is 5. This means Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

Now, to find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original amount:

20 (original amount) - 5 (amount left) = 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how much money Walter received from selling the apples, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many apples Walter ate. To do this, we'll multiply the total number of apples (60) by 2/5.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples.

2. Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. We'll subtract the number of apples Walter ate from the total number of apples.

60 - 24 = 36

3. Next, we need to find out how many apples Walter gave to his sister. To do this, we'll find 25% of the remaining apples.

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

4. Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining after Walter gave some to his sister. We'll subtract the number of apples he gave away from the remaining apples.

36 - 9 = 27

5. Finally, we need to find out how much money Walter received from selling the remaining apples. We'll multiply the number of apples he sold by the price per apple.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, Michael traveled for 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance covered = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the distance covered. 

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100

"To find the initial number of grapes, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Madeline ate 6 grapes. Then, her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes. 

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes. This leaves us with the remaining grapes that their mother will use to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she can make is 36 / 12 = 3 pies.

The total number of grapes used by their mother is 3 * 12 = 36 grapes. To find the initial number of grapes, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother. This is 6 (Madeline) + 30 (her brother) + 36 (their mother) = 72 grapes.

However, this is not the initial number of grapes. We need to consider that the mother used all the remaining grapes to make 3 pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used by the mother is indeed 36. This means that the remaining grapes after Madeline and her brother used their grapes is 72 - 36 = 36 grapes.

Now, we know that the mother used 36 grapes to make 3 pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the initial number of grapes is 36 (remaining grapes) + 36 (grapes used by Madeline and her brother) = 72 grapes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to calculate the number of teachers who were not sick and then add the number of substitute teachers.

First, we find the number of teachers who were not sick by subtracting the number of teachers who were sick from the total number of teachers:

82 (total number of teachers) - 13 (number of teachers sick) = 69

Next, we add the number of substitute teachers to find the total number of teachers at school:

69 (number of teachers not sick) + 9 (number of substitute teachers) = 78

Therefore, there were 78 teachers at school that day.

"To find out what percentage of their day the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, we need to know how many hours they work in a day and how many hours it takes to clean all the classrooms.

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the total time they have to clean, we multiply this by the number of days they have: 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours.

Now, let's find out how long it takes to clean all the classrooms. There are 80 classrooms, and it takes 15 minutes to clean each one. We convert this to hours by dividing by 60: 15 minutes / 60 = 0.25 hours/classroom. Multiply this by the number of classrooms: 80 classrooms * 0.25 hours/classroom = 20 hours.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms by dividing the time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiplying by 100: (20 hours / 40 hours) * 100 = 50%.

"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to determine the capacity of each shelf. 

The middle shelves can hold 10 books each. 
The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase: 
Middle shelf 1 + Middle shelf 2 + Bottom shelf + Top shelf = 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are needed to hold all of them. 
To do this, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 
110 ÷ 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue of the eggs.

First, let's find the total cost. Since Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs for $2.40 per dozen, we multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen:

5 dozens × $2.40/dozen = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Rose bought 5 × 12 = 60 eggs.

Now, let's find the total revenue. Rose sells the eggs for $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:

60 eggs ÷ 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Since she sells each set for $1, the total revenue will be:

20 sets × $1/set = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we need to find out her total score required to pass and then subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test.

First, let's find out how many questions she needs to get right in total. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions right, and the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions right. This can be calculated as:

70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions

Since she got 60% of the first test's questions right, which is 60% of 70 questions, we can calculate this as:

60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions

Now, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right:

77 (total questions needed) - 42 (questions got right on the first test) = 35 questions

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Mary makes some strawberry cubes and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes in total, we need to find out how many blueberry cubes she makes.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We can write an equation for the total number of ice cubes: S + B = 116.

We also know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write another equation: B = 5S - 4.

Now, we can substitute the expression for B into the first equation: S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's find the total number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

First, let's find the total time it takes for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings. Since it takes 7 minutes for the old varnish to dry on one painting, we multiply 7 minutes by 6:

7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 7 * 6 = 42 minutes

Next, we find the total time it takes for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings. Since it takes 12 minutes for the new varnish to dry on one painting, we multiply 12 minutes by 6:

12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 12 * 6 = 72 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the old varnish and the new varnish:

72 minutes (new varnish) - 42 minutes (old varnish) = 30 minutes

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we need to calculate the water needed for each type of plant and add them together.

Next, we'll find the total water needed for the 8 plants that require 1 cup of water each. This is simply 8 x 1 = 8 cups.

Now, let's find the total water needed for the remaining 8 plants that require a quarter of a cup of water each. This can be calculated as 8 x 0.25 = 2 cups.

To find the total amount of water Crista needs, we add the water needed for each type of plant: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes to cover each half of the distance and add them together.

Since Phineas is 200 yards away from home, half of the distance is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.

Time taken to cover 100 yards on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute is 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.

Time taken to cover 100 yards in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute is 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

Total time taken to return home is 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes needed by the cost per box.

Cost per box: $2.00
Number of boxes needed: 7
Total cost: 7 × $2.00 = $14.00

The final answer is: $14.00"
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to figure out how much each additional phone costs and then add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's say the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

2x / 2 = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, Derrick makes 10 × 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

The price of each doughnut is $2. So, the total amount of money Derrick makes in a day is 120 × $2 = $240.

June has 30 days. Therefore, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June is $240 × 30 = $7200.

The final answer is: $7200"

"To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to calculate the cost for each item and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

First, let's find the cost for each item per week:

- Blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
- Skirts: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00
- Pants: 2 pants * $8.00 per pair = $16.00

Now, let's add up the cost for each item per week: $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00

To find the total cost for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5: $47.00 * 5 = $235.00

The final answer is: $235.00"
"To find out how long it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to know his new speaking speed and the total number of words in those pages.

First, let's find John's new speaking speed. Since he's 2.5 times faster than his original speed of 150 words per minute (WPM), we multiply 150 by 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so we multiply 10 pages by 450 words per page.

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

To find the time it takes to speak 4500 words, we divide the total number of words by John's new speaking speed.

Time = Total words / New speed = 4500 words / 375 WPM

To do this calculation, we can convert the minutes to a more manageable unit, like hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can divide 375 by 60 to get the speed in words per hour.

375 WPM ÷ 60 = 6.25 words per second
6.25 words per second * 3600 seconds per hour = 22500 words per hour

Now we can calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words.

Time = Total words / Speed = 4500 words / 22500 words per hour
Time = 4500 / 22500
Time = 0.2 hours

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60.

Time = 0.2 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 12 minutes

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining four days.

Let's start by finding the total number of people Conor saw on the first three days. On the first day, Conor saw 50 people. On the second day, he saw 20 more people than on the first day, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people. On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so he saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To find the total number of popcorn pieces, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and add them up.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

The final answer is: 210"
"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make. He's making 4 gallons for the party and an extra gallon for his friend Allen. 

Total gallons = 4 + 1 = 5 gallons

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to find out how many cups of juice are needed for 5 gallons.

Total cups of juice = 5 gallons × 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups

Now, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for the extra tart lemonade. This lemonade is twice as tart as the other gallons, which means it requires twice the amount of lemon juice.

Extra tart lemonade cups = 1 gallon × 2 = 2 cups

Total lemons needed for the extra tart lemonade = 2 cups ÷ 1 cup/6 lemons = 2/6 × 6 = 2 lemons

Total lemons needed for the regular lemonade = 5 cups ÷ 1 cup/6 lemons = 5/6 × 6 = 5 lemons

Total lemons needed = 2 lemons (for the extra tart lemonade) + 5 lemons (for the regular lemonade) = 7 lemons

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both German Shepherds and Bulldogs, then multiply it by 7.

First, let's find the daily consumption of each type of dog. German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms of dog food per day, and there are 3 of them. So, the daily consumption of German Shepherds is 3 x 5 = 15 kilograms. Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms of dog food per day, and there are 2 of them. So, the daily consumption of Bulldogs is 2 x 3 = 6 kilograms.

Now, we add the daily consumption of both types of dogs to find the total daily consumption: 15 kg/day + 6 kg/day = 21 kg/day.

To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg.

"To find the total number of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals separately and then add them together.

For 2-legged animals: 10 animals * 2 legs per animal = 20 legs
For 4-legged animals: 15 animals * 4 legs per animal = 60 legs

Total number of legs = 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since the question asks for pairs of animal legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs.

Total pairs of legs = 80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs

"To find the number of red blocks in the tower, we need to determine the total number of blue and yellow blocks first. 

There are 4 blue blocks. 
Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, we can calculate the number of yellow blocks by multiplying the number of blue blocks by 2: 4 * 2 = 8 yellow blocks.

Now, we add the number of blue and yellow blocks to find the total number of these blocks: 4 + 8 = 12 blocks.

Since the tower has a total of 32 blocks, we can find the number of red blocks by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

"To find out how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled east and then subtract the distance he traveled west.

First, let's find the distance Elvis traveled west. We know he drove at an average speed of 18 miles per hour for 5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 18 mph * 5 hours = 90 miles.

Next, we find the distance Elvis traveled east. He drove at the same speed of 18 miles per hour for 8 hours. We multiply the speed by the time: 18 mph * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the difference between the two distances to determine how far he is from his house now. The difference is 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

The initial value of the boat is $9000. 

In the first year, the boat depreciates by 30%. To find 30% of $9000, we multiply $9000 by 0.3. This gives us $2700. So, the value of the boat after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30%. To find 30% of $6300, we multiply $6300 by 0.3. This gives us $1890. So, the value of the boat after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20%. To find 20% of $4410, we multiply $4410 by 0.2. This gives us $882. So, the value of the boat after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies.

The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so it is 2 * 54 = 108.

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so it is 54 / 2 = 27.

The total number of red, orange, and yellow candies is 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Since there are 232 candies in total, the number of pink candies is 232 - 189 = 43.

"To find the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the bus trips separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total cost of the hotel. The cost of one night at the hotel is $80, and Helen stayed for 3 nights. 

Cost of one night at the hotel: $80
Number of nights: 3
Total cost of the hotel: $80 * 3 = $240

Next, let's find the total cost of the bus trips. The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel. To find 10% of a number, we multiply it by 0.1. 

Cost of one night at the hotel: $80
Cost of one bus trip: 10% of $80 = 0.1 * $80 = $8
Number of bus trips: 7
Total cost of the bus trips: $8 * 7 = $56

Now, we add the total cost of the hotel and the bus trips to find the total cost of Helen's trip.

Total cost of the hotel: $240
Total cost of the bus trips: $56
Total cost of the trip: $240 + $56 = $296

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Mazie has 52 marbles and gives them to twins, Dallas and Darla. We also know that Dallas has a total of 21 marbles after dropping 4 of them in the playground.

To find out how many marbles Dallas initially had, we need to add the marbles he dropped back to the marbles he has now. This can be calculated as:

Initial marbles Dallas had = marbles Dallas has now + marbles dropped
Initial marbles Dallas had = 21 + 4
Initial marbles Dallas had = 25

Now that we know Dallas had 25 marbles initially, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting the marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles Mazie had:

Marbles Darla received = Total marbles Mazie had - marbles Dallas received
Marbles Darla received = 52 - 25
Marbles Darla received = 27

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla."

Jackie's height = 72"" - 2""
Jackie's height = 70""

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we can find her height before summer by subtracting 3"" from her current height.

Jackie's height before summer = Jackie's height - 3""
Jackie's height before summer = 70"" - 3""
Jackie's height before summer = 67""

The final answer is: 67"
"To find out how much money the company receives for selling the chocolate bars, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

First, let's find out how many bars the company produces in one week. Since they produce 5000 bars in a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 5000 by 7.

5000 bars/day * 7 days/week = 35000 bars/week

Now, we need to find out how many bars they produce in two weeks. We multiply the number of bars produced in one week by 2.

35000 bars/week * 2 weeks = 70000 bars

The price of each bar is $2. To find the total money the company receives, we multiply the total number of bars by the price per bar.

70000 bars * $2/bar = $140000

The final answer is: $140000"
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, but there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, we need to calculate the cost of one T-shirt at the original price and the other at 50% off. The cost of the first T-shirt is $8, and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 * 0.4 = $16. The discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to calculate his total earnings from his allowance and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan's weekly allowance is $6, and he completed his chores for 3 weeks. So, his total allowance is 6 * 3 = $18.

The cost of ice cream cones for Ryan and his 3 friends is 4 cones * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's calculate Ryan's remaining money after buying the ice cream cones: $18 - $5 = $13.

To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to divide his remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket: $13 ÷ $6.50 = 2.

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani, we need to add up the costs of all the items they purchased.

Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. To find the total amount she spent, we add these two costs together: $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. To find the total cost of the bathrobes, we multiply the cost of one bathrobe by 2: $100 x 2 = $200. Then, we add the cost of the sunglasses to this total: $30 + $200 = $230.

Now, we add the total amount spent by Ellen to the total amount spent by Lani: $105 + $230 = $335.

The final answer is: $335"
"To find the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of making one jar and then multiply it by 10.

First, let's find the cost of making one jar. We need 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of honey. The cost of each ingredient is as follows:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20

The total cost of making one jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

Now, we need to find the profit from selling one jar. The selling price of one jar is $50. So, the profit from one jar is $50 - $44 = $6.

To find the profit from 10 jars, we multiply the profit from one jar by 10: $6 * 10 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of each type of coin:

- 32 quarters = 32 x $0.25 = $8.00
- 95 dimes = 95 x $0.10 = $9.50
- 120 nickels = 120 x $0.05 = $6.00
- 750 pennies = 750 x $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add the values together:
$8.00 + $9.50 = $17.50
$17.50 + $6.00 = $23.50
$23.50 + $7.50 = $31.00

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."

"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to figure out how many days he's open and how many cars he services in that time.

Josh is open 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday) and not open 2 days a week (Sunday and Wednesday). So, he's open 5 days a week.

In 1 week, Josh is open 5 days, so he services 5 * 3 = 15 cars.

In 2 weeks, Josh is open 10 days, so he services 10 * 3 = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so in 2 weeks, he makes 30 * $4 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. To find the total number of cookies he has initially, we add these amounts together:

9 (oatmeal) + 4 (chocolate chip) + 5 (sugar) = 18 cookies

Now, let's see what happens next. Randy eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This means he eats 1 oatmeal cookie, 1 chocolate chip cookie, and 1 sugar cookie. So, he eats a total of 3 cookies.

Next, Randy eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. Now, he has:

9 (oatmeal) - 2 (eaten) = 7 oatmeal cookies
4 (chocolate chip) - 1 (eaten) = 3 chocolate chip cookies
5 (sugar) - 1 (eaten) = 4 sugar cookies

Then, Randy gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. Now, he has:

7 (oatmeal) - 0 (given away) = 7 oatmeal cookies
3 (chocolate chip) - 0 (given away) = 3 chocolate chip cookies
4 (sugar) - 2 (given away) = 2 sugar cookies

Finally, Randy bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. This means he adds 4 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies to his collection.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has now:

7 (oatmeal) + 4 (new oatmeal) = 11 oatmeal cookies
3 (chocolate chip) + 4 (new chocolate chip) = 7 chocolate chip cookies
2 (sugar) + 4 (new sugar) = 6 sugar cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we add these amounts together:

11 (oatmeal) + 7 (chocolate chip) + 6 (sugar) = 24 cookies

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, he can divide them into two equal halves: 6 toy soldiers for the first half and 6 toy soldiers for the second half.

For the first half, he would get 6 toy soldiers * $5 per toy = $30.

For the second half, he would get 6 toy soldiers * $7 per toy = $42.

To find the total amount, we add the two amounts together: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many holes the dog digs in total and then figure out how many days it takes Nate to fill them in.

First, let's find the total number of holes dug by the dog. The dog digs 6 holes a day, and Nate is on vacation for 14 days. 

Total holes dug = 6 holes/day * 14 days
Total holes dug = 84 holes

Since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, we need to add these to the total holes dug during the day. However, the problem doesn't specify how many days Nate fills the holes, so we'll assume he fills the holes for the same number of days he was on vacation.

Holes dug at night = 6 holes/night * 14 nights
Holes dug at night = 84 holes
Total holes = 84 + 84
Total holes = 168

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. He fills 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3.

Days to fill holes = Total holes / Net holes filled per day
Days to fill holes = 168 / 3
Days to fill holes = 56

Since we need to find the number of weeks, we'll divide the total days by 7.

Weeks to fill holes = Days to fill holes / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 56 / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4 to find the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Average enrollment at Norman High School: 4000 students
Average enrollment at Butler High School: 4000 * (3/4) = 3000 students

Now, we can find the difference in enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in enrollment: 4000 - 3000 = 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Let's start by adding the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies:

Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075
Total of rainbow and oatmeal cookies = 2595 + 3075 = 5670

Now, we'll subtract this total from the total number of cookies made:

Total cookies made = 7995
Total of rainbow and oatmeal cookies = 5670
Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - Total of rainbow and oatmeal cookies
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The final answer is: 2325"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

He also gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested. Since he gathered 8 test tubes, we can set up an equation to find the number of Petri dishes: 8 = 14 + 2. However, this equation doesn't make sense because it implies Igor gathered more test tubes than he was supposed to. Let's try again. If Igor gathered 2 more test tubes than Petri dishes, we can set up the equation: 8 = x + 2, where x is the number of Petri dishes. Solving for x, we get x = 6.

However, this contradicts the information that Igor gathered 14 Petri dishes. Let's try again. If Igor gathered 2 fewer test tubes than Petri dishes, we can set up the equation: 8 = 14 - 2. Solving for x, we get x = 10, but this is not the correct number of Petri dishes. However, if Igor gathered 2 fewer test tubes than Petri dishes, we can set up the equation: 8 = 14 - 2 is incorrect, but 8 = 12 - 4 is correct.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to determine the number of eggs in the second basket and then add it to the number of eggs in the first basket.

Since the second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, and the first basket has 10 eggs, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket by multiplying the number of eggs in the first basket by 2. This gives us 2 * 10 = 20 eggs in the second basket.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30 eggs.

Let's start by finding the amount raised by Kim. Since Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, and Alexandra raises $430, we can write an equation to represent this relationship:

Kim's amount = Alexandra's amount + $320
Kim's amount = $430 + $320
Kim's amount = $750

Next, we'll find the amount raised by Maryam. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raises $300. We can write an equation to represent this relationship:

Maryam's amount = Sarah's amount + $400
Maryam's amount = $300 + $400
Maryam's amount = $700

Now, we add the amounts raised by each girl to find the total:

Total amount = Kim's amount + Alexandra's amount + Maryam's amount + Sarah's amount
Total amount = $750 + $430 + $700 + $300
Total amount = $2180

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, which means if Aaron runs a certain distance in a certain amount of time, Vanessa will run the same distance in twice as long. We also know that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.

Let's say Aaron runs 1 mile in x minutes. Since Vanessa runs twice as fast as Aaron, she will run 1 mile in x/2 minutes.

We're given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, but we don't know how far he ran. However, we do know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, Aaron must have run half the distance of Vanessa, which is 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

Now we can set up an equation to find the time it takes Aaron to run 1 mile:

x * 2 = 16 (since Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes)

Solving for x, we get:
x = 16 / 2
x = 8

Now that we know Aaron runs 1 mile in 8 minutes, we can find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile:
Vanessa runs 1 mile in x/2 = 8/2 = 4 minutes

However, we need to find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 4 miles. Since Vanessa runs 1 mile in 4 minutes, we can multiply the time it takes her to run 1 mile by 4:
4 * 4 = 16 minutes

Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. 

Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3: 
200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

He already has 6 feet of new line, so we subtract that from the total amount needed: 
600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To figure out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's find out how much they make in a day. They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation comes with 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. So, the total cost of each reservation is:

2 meals * $5 = $10
Adding the $5 bottle of wine, the total cost per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15

Since they get 6 reservations a night, their daily revenue is:

6 reservations * $15 per reservation = $90

Now, we need to find out how much they make in a week. They are open 2 days a week, so we multiply their daily revenue by 2:

$90 * 2 = $180

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the cost of each watermelon, we need to first find the total selling price of all the watermelons. 

The profit percentage is 25%, which means the selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit). 

Let's say the cost price of 1 watermelon is x. Then, the cost price of 50 watermelons is 50x.

The cost price of 50 watermelons is $80. So, we can set up the equation:
50x = $80

To find the cost of 1 watermelon, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 50:
x = $80 / 50
x = $1.60

Now, let's find the selling price of 1 watermelon. The selling price is 125% of the cost price, which is 1.25 times the cost price:
Selling price of 1 watermelon = 1.25x
Selling price of 1 watermelon = 1.25 * $1.60
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find James' current age. We know that James is twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

Now, we need to find John's current age. We know that John had James when he was 19, but this information is inconsistent because it would make James' age negative. Let's ignore this information and focus on the fact that James is 18 years old.

We are also given that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. This means John's youngest son is currently 32 years old.

To find John's current age, we need to know how old he was when his youngest son was born. Since his youngest son is 32 now, John must be 32 + 32 = 64 years old now.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 32 + 3 = 35 years old.

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange and Jane takes 4 minutes to do the same. We want to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour.

First, we need to find out how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour. To do this, we'll divide the total number of minutes in an hour (60) by the time it takes each of them to peel an orange.

For Ana: 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges
For Jane: 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane. To do this, we'll subtract the number of oranges peeled by Jane from the number of oranges peeled by Ana.

20 (Ana's oranges) - 15 (Jane's oranges) = 5 oranges

So, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

The final answer is: 5"
"So Mark's car broke down and he needs a new radiator. He goes to a junk shop and gets it for 80% off the original price of $400. To find the discounted price, I'll multiply the original price by the discount percentage. 

The discount is 80% off, so I'll multiply 400 by 0.8 to get the discount amount: 400 * 0.8 = $320. 

Now, I'll subtract the discount from the original price to get the cost of the radiator: 400 - 320 = $80.

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so I'll multiply the number of hours by the hourly rate to get the labor cost: 3 * 50 = $150.

To find the total cost, I'll add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost: 80 + 150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the total number of animals is 20, and they are either chickens or cows. Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. So, we have the equation C + W = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. So, the total number of legs can be expressed as 2C + 4W = 70.

We can solve the first equation for W: W = 20 - C.

Substituting this expression for W into the second equation, we get 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

So, the number of chickens is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 × 8 = 56.

There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends). To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 ÷ 4 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
