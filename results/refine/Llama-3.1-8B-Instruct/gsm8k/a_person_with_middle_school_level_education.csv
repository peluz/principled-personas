"Let's figure out how much money Janet makes at the farmers' market.

Janet lays 16 eggs every day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for muffins. To find out how many eggs she has left, we need to subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs.

16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs used) = 9 eggs left

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 each. To find out how much money she makes, we multiply the number of eggs left by the price per egg.

9 eggs * $2/egg = $18

So, Janet makes $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To make a robe, you need 2 bolts of blue fiber. The problem says you need half as much white fiber as blue fiber. To find half of 2, you divide 2 by 2. 

2 ÷ 2 = 1

So, you need 1 bolt of white fiber. Now, you add the blue fiber and white fiber together.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"So Josh wants to flip a house. He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs. This makes the house worth more, 150% more. That's like tripling the original price.

Let's find the new value of the house. We multiply the original price by 3 (since 150% is the same as 1.5, and 1.5 is the same as 3/2, and 3 is the same as 3/1, so we can just multiply by 3).

New value = Original value * 3
New value = $80,000 * 3
New value = $240,000

Now, we need to find the total cost of the house, which is the original price plus the repairs:
Total cost = Original price + Repairs
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

The profit is the difference between the new value and the total cost:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $240,000 - $130,000
Profit = $110,000

The final answer is: $110,000"
"To find out how many meters James runs in a week, we need to know how many meters he runs in one session and how many sessions he does in a week.

James runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, we multiply the number of sprints by the distance of each sprint to find the total meters in one session:
3 sprints × 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, we multiply the total meters in one session by the number of sessions he does in a week:
180 meters/session × 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to know how much feed she gives them in total and how much she gives them per meal.

First, let's find out how much feed she gives her chickens in total. She gives them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. To find the total, we add those two numbers together: 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Now, we need to know how much feed each chicken needs per meal. Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal. Since she has 20 chickens, we multiply 3 cups by 20 chickens to find out the total cups of feed needed per meal: 3 x 20 = 60 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to find the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.80. 
We can see that the cost of each glass decreases by 40% each time. 

Let's find the pattern: 
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $5 * 0.6 = $3.
- The third glass costs $3 * 0.6 = $1.80.
- The fourth glass costs $1.80 * 0.6 = $1.08.
- The fifth glass costs $1.08 * 0.6 = $0.65 (not $0.64, I made a mistake earlier).

Now, we can see that the cost of each glass is 60% of the previous glass. We can use this pattern to find the cost of the remaining glasses.

The cost of the first 4 glasses is $5 + $3 + $1.80 + $1.08 = $10.88.
The cost of the fifth glass is $0.65. 
The cost of the sixth glass is $0.65 * 0.6 = $0.39.
The cost of the seventh glass is $0.39 * 0.6 = $0.235.
The cost of the eighth glass is $0.235 * 0.6 = $0.141.
The cost of the ninth glass is $0.141 * 0.6 = $0.0846.
The cost of the tenth glass is $0.0846 * 0.6 = $0.05076.
The cost of the eleventh glass is $0.05076 * 0.6 = $0.030456.
The cost of the twelfth glass is $0.030456 * 0.6 = $0.0182736.
The cost of the thirteenth glass is $0.0182736 * 0.6 = $0.01097416.
The cost of the fourteenth glass is $0.01097416 * 0.6 = $0.006594096.
The cost of the fifteenth glass is $0.006594096 * 0.6 = $0.0039666576.
The cost of the sixteenth glass is $0.0039666576 * 0.6 = $0.00237999456.

Now, we add up the costs of all 16 glasses: 
$5 + $3 + $1.80 + $1.08 + $0.65 + $0.39 + $0.235 + $0.141 + $0.0846 + $0.05076 + $0.030456 + $0.0182736 + $0.01097416 + $0.006594096 + $0.0039666576 + $0.00237999456 = $23.016

The total cost is $23.016."
"Let's figure out how many sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together.

We know that Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so we multiply 20 by 4 to find out how many sheep Charleston has. That's 4 x 20 = 80 sheep.

Now, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we multiply 80 by 2 to find out how many sheep Toulouse has. That's 2 x 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it takes to download 40% of the file. To do this, we need to find 40% of 200 GB. 

40% of 200 GB is the same as 0.4 x 200 GB. To multiply a decimal by a whole number, we can just multiply the numbers and then put the decimal point in the right place. 

0.4 x 200 = 80 GB

Now we know that Carla needs to download 80 GB. Since she can download 2 GB per minute, we can find the time it takes to download 80 GB by dividing 80 by 2.

80 ÷ 2 = 40 minutes

So it takes Carla 40 minutes to download 80 GB. But then Windows forces a restart, and Carla has to start all over again. This means she has to download the whole file again, which is 200 GB. 

We already know that Carla can download 2 GB per minute, so we can find the time it takes to download 200 GB by dividing 200 by 2.

200 ÷ 2 = 100 minutes

But we also need to add the 20 minutes it takes to install the updates. So the total time it takes to download the file is 100 minutes + 20 minutes + 40 minutes (the time it took to download the first 80 GB).

100 + 20 + 40 = 160 minutes

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down John's trip into smaller parts to figure out how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 60 × 3
Distance = 180 miles

Now, John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. But, he gets stuck in standstill traffic for 2 hours. This means he doesn't move at all during this time, so the distance he traveled is 0 miles.

Next, John drives for half an hour at 30 miles per hour. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 30 × 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

After that, John drives for the remaining 2 hours at 80 miles per hour. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 80 × 2
Distance = 160 miles

Now, let's add up all the distances John traveled:

180 miles (first part of the trip) + 0 miles (standstill traffic) + 15 miles (half-hour drive) + 160 miles (remaining drive) = 355 miles

Since John is now back home, the distance he is from home is 0 miles.

However, if we are looking for the distance from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to consider the distance he has traveled in the 4 hours. 

Distance from home at the end of the 4 hours = 0 miles"
"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to do two parts. First, we find out how much she earns for the regular hours she works, and then we find out how much she earns for the extra hours she works.

Eliza works 40 hours a week at $10 per hour. So, we multiply 40 hours by $10 to find her earnings for the regular hours: 40 × $10 = $400.

Now, we need to find out how much she earns for the extra hours. She worked a total of 45 hours, and 40 of those hours are regular hours. So, the extra hours she worked are 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular pay, which is 1.2 × $10 = $12 per hour. So, we multiply 5 hours by $12 to find her earnings for the extra hours: 5 × $12 = $60.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find her total earnings for the week: $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

First, we know the program had 60 downloads in the first month.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. To find three times 60, we multiply 60 by 3: 60 × 3 = 180.

Now, let's find the number of downloads in the third month. We know that the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3: 180 × 0.3 = 54. 

Now, we subtract 54 from 180 to find the number of downloads in the third month: 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost of the pastries, we need to multiply the number of each type of pastry by its price and then add those costs together.

First, let's find the cost of the donuts. There are 3 dozen donuts, and each dozen costs $68. So, the cost of the donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.

Next, we'll find the cost of the mini cupcakes. There are 2 dozen cupcakes, and each dozen costs $80. So, the cost of the cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.

Now, let's find the cost of the mini cheesecakes. There are 6 dozen cheesecakes, and each dozen costs $55. So, the cost of the cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"Let's figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree.

First, we need to know how much money Carlos will spend on the tree and how much money he will make from it each year.

The tree costs $90 to plant. This is like a big upfront cost.

Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, and Carlos can sell each lemon for $1.5. So, he will make 7 x $1.5 = $10.50 each year from selling lemons.

But, it costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year. So, we need to subtract this cost from the money he makes from selling lemons. This is called the net profit.

Net profit = money made from lemons - cost to water and feed the tree
= $10.50 - $3
= $7.50

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tree to pay for itself. We can do this by dividing the upfront cost by the net profit.

$90 (upfront cost) ÷ $7.50 (net profit) = 12 years

So, it will take 12 years for the tree to pay for itself. But, we want to know when it starts earning money. Since the tree will start generating revenue in the first year, we can say that it will start earning money in the 1st year.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If she had x vacuum cleaners at the start, she sold x/3 at the green house. That means she had 2/3 of her vacuum cleaners left.

2/3 of x is the same as (2/3)x. So, she had (2/3)x vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. Now, she had (2/3)x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of (2/3)x - 2 is (1/2)(2/3)x - 1, which is (1/3)x - 1.

So, she had (2/3)x - 2 - (1/3)x + 1 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house. This simplifies to (1/3)x - 1.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (1/3)x - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: (1/3)x = 6.

Now, we multiply both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's figure out what percentage of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 4 students. That's because 20% is the same as 20/100, and 20/100 * 20 = 4.

Now, we need to find out how many students are left. We subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students: 20 - 4 = 16.

Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of 16 students is 4 students. That's because 25% is the same as 25/100, and 25/100 * 16 = 4.

Now, we need to find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance. We subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students: 20 - 4 - 4 = 12.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out which item will make the merchant the most money, we need to figure out how much more money each item will be worth after the prices go up.

The jewelry is worth $5,000 and will go up by 2.5%. To find 2.5% of $5,000, we multiply 0.025 (which is the same as 2.5%) by $5,000. This is 0.025 * $5,000 = $125.

The electronic gadgets are worth $8,000 and will go up by 1.2%. To find 1.2% of $8,000, we multiply 0.012 (which is the same as 1.2%) by $8,000. This is 0.012 * $8,000 = $96.

Since $125 is more than $96, the merchant should buy the jewelry. The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125.

The final answer is: $125"
"So, we have two trains that leave San Rafael at the same time. They travel west for 80 miles on the first day, and then they travel north for 150 miles on the second day. We need to find out how far each train traveled in total.

To do this, we can use a special formula called the Pythagorean theorem. It's like a secret code to find the distance between two points. The formula is:

√(a² + b²) = c

where a and b are the two sides, and c is the hypotenuse (the longest side).

In this case, the two sides are the 80 miles they traveled west and the 150 miles they traveled north. So, we plug those numbers into the formula:

√(80² + 150²)
= √(6400 + 22500)
= √28900

Now, we need to find the square root of 28900. That's like finding the number that, when multiplied by itself, gives us 28900. And that number is... 170!

So, each train traveled a total of 170 miles."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate how much she makes from teaching and coaching, and then add those two numbers together.

First, let's find out how much she makes from teaching. She gets paid $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. If she works 50 weeks a year, we multiply the hours she works per week by the number of weeks she works per year.

35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year

Now, we multiply the total hours she works per year by her hourly wage.

1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's find out how much she makes from coaching. She gets paid $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. If she works 50 weeks a year, we multiply the hours she works per week by the number of weeks she works per year.

15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year

Now, we multiply the total hours she works per year by her hourly wage.

750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we add the two numbers together to find her total annual salary.

$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to know how many eggs she eats in a day and how many days are in 4 weeks.

Claire eats 3 eggs every morning for breakfast. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 x 7 = 28 days.

Now, we multiply the number of days by the number of eggs she eats per day: 28 days x 3 eggs/day = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat: 84 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and another 2 miles in 1 hour. Now, she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the whole hike. To find out how much time she has left, we need to know how much time she has already spent walking. She spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and another hour on the next 2 miles, so she has spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles.

To find the total time she needs to complete the hike, we divide the total distance by her desired average speed:

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Since she has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much water is in the 10 liters of orange drink. Since it's two-thirds water, we can multiply 10 by 2/3.

10 liters * (2/3) = 20/3 liters

To make it easier to work with, we can convert this to a decimal by dividing 20 by 3.

20 ÷ 3 = 6.67 liters

Now, let's find out how much water is in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since it's three-fifths water, we can multiply 15 by 3/5.

15 liters * (3/5) = 45/5 liters

To make it easier to work with, we can convert this to a decimal by dividing 45 by 5.

45 ÷ 5 = 9 liters

Now, we add the water from both drinks together.

6.67 liters + 9 liters = 15.67 liters

But wait, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink. So, we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water.

15.67 liters - 1 liter = 14.67 liters

Now, we need to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. Since we have 14.67 liters of water, the remaining amount of non-water liquid is 24 - 14.67 = 9.33 liters.

Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is (1/3) * 9.33 = 3.11 liters.

Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is (2/5) * 9.33 = 3.732 liters.

To find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we add the water from the orange drink, the pineapple drink, and the water we already have.

14.67 liters + 3.11 liters + 3.732 liters = 21.512 liters

The final answer is: $\boxed{21.51}$"
"Let's figure out how many years ago Raymond's son was born.

We know that Samantha is 31 years old, and Raymond is 6 years younger than her. So, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

We also know that Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago that was, we need to subtract 23 from Raymond's current age.

25 (Raymond's current age) - 23 (age when he had a son) = 2

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's figure out how many DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday.

First, we need to find out how many DVDs the first 3 customers bought. Since each of them bought 1 DVD, we multiply 3 (the number of customers) by 1 (the number of DVDs each customer bought). That's 3 x 1 = 3 DVDs.

Next, we need to find out how many DVDs the next 2 customers bought. Since each of them bought 2 DVDs, we multiply 2 (the number of customers) by 2 (the number of DVDs each customer bought). That's 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, we add the number of DVDs the first 3 customers bought (3) to the number of DVDs the next 2 customers bought (4). That's 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"To find out how much shorter the candle will be, we need to know how long it burns and how fast it melts. The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is 4 hours.

The candle melts 2 centimeters every hour. To find the total amount it melts, we multiply the rate at which it melts by the time it burns.

Total melting = rate * time
Total melting = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
Total melting = 8 cm

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to figure out how much more money it cost before the discount. 

Let's say the original price is 'x'. Since the book was sold for 25% less than the original price, that means 75% of the original price is the price we know, which is $19.50. 

We can write this as an equation: 0.75x = 19.50

To find 'x', we need to get rid of the 0.75. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75. 

x = 19.50 ÷ 0.75
x = 26

So, the original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples. 

The chicken meal costs $12. 
5 packs of milk cost $3 each, so 5 x $3 = $15.
4 apples cost $1.50 each, so 4 x $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so we need to subtract the cost of the chicken, milk, and apples from that to find the cost of the pizza boxes. $50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so we need to divide $17 by $8.50 to find the number of boxes. 

$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2

"To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to add up the cost of the shorts, pants, and shoes.

First, let's find the cost of the shorts: 3 x $16.50 = $49.50

Next, let's find the cost of the pants: 3 x $22.50 = $67.50

Now, let's find the cost of the shoes: 3 x $42 = $126

To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to add these costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to know how many cartons she buys and how much each carton costs.

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night for 60 days. Since each carton has 15 servings, we need to divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she needs:

60 ÷ 15 = 4

So, Cynthia needs 4 cartons of ice cream.

Each carton costs $4.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 × $4.00 = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"Let's figure out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops.

We know that Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. The total trip was 60 miles.

To find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip, we need to subtract 15 miles from 60 miles.

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we need to find the distance between the first and second stops. We can do this by subtracting the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip.

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

So, Henry traveled 15 miles between his first and second stops.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Gloria has to choose between a pair of boots and two pairs of high heels. The two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much as the first pair.

We can find the cost of the more expensive pair of heels by multiplying the cost of the less expensive pair by 2. So, the more expensive pair costs 2 * 33 = $66.

Now, we know that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. We can write an equation to represent this: B = 33 + 66 - 5, where B is the cost of the boots.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

The final answer is: $94"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means that for every 7 parts of Darrell's age, Allen has 11 parts of his age.

Let's say Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a number we need to find.

We know that their total age is 162, so we can write an equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Now, divide both sides by 18: x = 162 ÷ 18 = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to add up all the guesses and divide by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one: 80 / 2 = 40, 40 + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first one: 80 * 0.25 = 20, 80 + 20 = 100.

So, the total number of guesses is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.
There are 3 people.

To find the average, we divide the total number of guesses by the number of people: 240 ÷ 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to know how many hours he spends per day and multiply that by 7.

John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day. So, we multiply 10 dogs by 0.5 hours.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours = 5 hours per day

Now, we multiply 5 hours by 7 to find out how many hours he spends in a week.

5 hours * 7 = 35 hours

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs.

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total. We also know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's call the number of silver coins S and the number of gold coins G.

We can write an equation to represent the total number of coins: S + G = 110.

We also know that G is 30 more than S, so we can write another equation: G = S + 30.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one: S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2S = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's figure out how many jewels Siobhan has.

First, we need to know how many jewels Raymond has. We're told that he has 40 jewels.

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. To find half of Raymond's jewels, we divide 40 by 2, which is 20. Then, we add 5 to that number to find out how many jewels Aaron has: 20 + 5 = 25.

Now, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. We know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we subtract 2 from 25: 25 - 2 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"So, Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes.  In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points.  In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 

To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25. 4 x 0.25 = 1. So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we need to find the total points. We add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to know how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and how much each set of yogurts costs.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. So, in 30 days, he eats 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys. We can do this by dividing the total number of yogurts by 4.

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per set = 15 sets.

Now, we need to find out how much each set costs. We already know that each set costs $5.00.

So, to find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we multiply the number of sets by the cost of each set.

15 sets x $5.00 per set = $75.00

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John has left, we need to figure out how much money he made from selling the Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money.

John sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is:
13 × 15 = $195

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
8 × 20 = $160

He also has $5 left, so the total amount of money he spent is:
$195 - $5 = $190

Now, we subtract the cost of the video games from the total amount of money he made:
$195 - $160 = $35

This means John spent $35 of his own money to buy the video games. Since he spent $35 of his own money, he must have used the remaining money from the Lego sales to buy the video games.

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he sold to get $35.
$35 ÷ 15 = 2.33 (round down to 2 since you can't sell a fraction of a Lego set)

However, we know he sold 13 Lego sets in total. So, he must have sold 2 Lego sets with his own money and the remaining 11 sets with the money from the Lego sales.

Therefore, John still has 13 - 2 = 11 Lego sets left.

The answer is 11."
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to know how many hours he runs in a week and how many miles he runs in a week. 

John runs 3 hours the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total hours John runs in a week = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we need to multiply the total hours by 3 to get the total weekly hours.
Total weekly hours = 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total miles by the total hours.
Speed = Total miles / Total hours = 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour

So, John runs at a speed of 3.33 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 3.33"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour. We also know that her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed. So, to find her running speed, we multiply her skipping speed by 2. 

3 miles per hour (skipping) * 2 = 6 miles per hour (running)

Now, we know that her running speed is 4 times her walking speed. To find her walking speed, we divide her running speed by 4.

6 miles per hour (running) ÷ 4 = 1.5 miles per hour (walking)

Next, we need to find out how much time she spends walking and running. We know she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she has 6 hours, we multiply 6 hours by 2/3 to find the time she spends walking and 6 hours by 1/3 to find the time she spends running.

Time spent walking: 6 hours * 2/3 = 4 hours
Time spent running: 6 hours * 1/3 = 2 hours

Now, we need to find the distance she travels while walking and running. We multiply the time she spends walking by her walking speed and the time she spends running by her running speed.

Distance traveled while walking: 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles
Distance traveled while running: 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles

Finally, we add the distance she travels while walking and running to find the total distance she can travel in 6 hours.

Total distance = 6 miles + 12 miles = 18 miles

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's figure out how old Brandon's iPhone is.

We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. We also know that Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. To find out how old Ben's iPhone is, we multiply the age of Suzy's iPhone by 2. 

2 x 1 = 2

So, Ben's iPhone is 2 years old. Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. To find out how old Brandon's iPhone is, we multiply the age of Ben's iPhone by 4.

4 x 2 = 8

So, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"So, we have a dragon named Perg that can breathe fire 1000 feet away. Polly has a special javelin that can hit the dragon, but it only goes 400 feet when she throws it normally. However, when she holds a sapphire gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. 

To find out how far she can throw it with the gemstone, we multiply 400 by 3. 

400 × 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's fire goes 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1000 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin. But we want to know how far outside the dragon's fire she can stand. 

To find that, we subtract 1000 from 1200.

1200 - 1000 = 200 feet

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's fire and still hit it with the javelin.

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's figure out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each one into 8 pieces. That means there were a total of 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of pie.

Now, we know that there were 14 pieces of pie left over after the guests ate. To find out how many pieces were taken, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. So, we do 40 - 14 = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to know how many calories you can still have left for the day. You want to eat 2000 calories, but you've already had 1800 calories. So, we subtract 1800 from 2000:

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Now, we need to find out how many servings of chips you can have with 200 calories. Each serving has 250 calories. To do this, we divide 200 by 250:

200 ÷ 250 = 0.8

This means you can have 0.8 servings of chips. Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we multiply 0.8 by 300:

0.8 × 300 = 240 grams

So, you can eat 240 grams of chips.

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's figure out Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles.

First, we need to know how much it costs Charlie to make one candle. He needs 1 pound of beeswax and a wick, which costs $10.00. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, the cost per candle is:

$10.00 ÷ 10 candles = $1.00 per candle

Now, let's find out how much it costs Charlie to make 20 candles:

$1.00 per candle * 20 candles = $20.00

Next, we need to find out how much money Charlie makes from selling 20 candles. He sells each candle for $2.00, so:

$2.00 per candle * 20 candles = $40.00

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the cost from the total money made:

Net profit = Total money made - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"Let's figure out how many hours Meredith spent writing articles. 

First, we need to find out how many articles she wrote each day. 

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 more articles than on Monday. To find out how many more articles she wrote, we multiply 5 by 2/5. That's 5 x 2/5 = 2. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Tuesday. That's 2 x 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the number of articles she wrote each day: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since it takes Meredith 4 hours to write one article, we multiply the total number of articles by 4 to find out how many hours she spent writing: 26 x 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"Let's figure out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice bought.

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left over. To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package, we need to add the Post-it notes she had left over to the ones she used at work and then subtract that from the total number of Post-it notes she had at the end.

Let's do the math:

Total Post-it notes at the end = 80 (initial) + x (package) - 220 (used) + 23 (remaining)

We can simplify this by adding the initial and remaining Post-it notes and subtracting the ones used:

80 + 23 = 103
103 - 220 = -117 (this is the opposite of what we want, so we need to make it positive)

To make it positive, we need to add 220 + 117 = 337

Now we know that 80 + x - 220 + 23 = 337

We can simplify this by adding 80 and 23:

103 + x - 220 = 337

Now we need to get x by itself. To do this, we need to add 220 to both sides of the equation:

103 + x = 337 + 220
103 + x = 557

Now we need to get rid of the 103 on the left side. To do this, we need to subtract 103 from both sides of the equation:

x = 557 - 103
x = 454

The final answer is: 454"
"Let's figure out how much John spent on ties.

John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. That means if he bought 5 blue ties, he bought 2 x 5 = 10 red ties.

The blue ties cost $40 each, and John spent $200 on them. To find out how many blue ties he bought, we can divide the total amount he spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie: 200 ÷ 40 = 5.

Since John bought 5 blue ties, he bought 2 x 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. That means they cost 1.5 x $40 = $60 each.

To find the total cost of the red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by their cost: 10 x $60 = $600.

Now, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount John spent on ties: $200 + $600 = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many pieces of wire Tracy got, we need to change the length of the wire from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so we multiply 4 feet by 12 inches.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we need to divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece. Each piece is 6 inches long.

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

So, Tracy got 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. There are 15 floors and 8 units per floor, so we do 15 x 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. To do this, we multiply the total number of units by 1/4: 120 units x 1/4 = 30 units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to know how many eggs his chickens lay and how much he sells them for.

First, let's find out how many eggs are laid per week. We know that his chickens lay 252 eggs per day. To find out how many eggs are laid per week, we multiply the number of eggs laid per day by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens are laid per week.

1764 eggs per week ÷ 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week.

147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it took Tom to sail from 1 to 4 PM. Since he was sailing at 10 miles per hour, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

The distance from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours, but we need to find the distance in miles. Since Tom was sailing at 10 miles per hour, we can multiply the time by the speed to get the distance: 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles.

Now that we know the distance is 30 miles, we can find the time it took to travel that distance: time = distance / speed = 30 miles / 10 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Next, we need to find the time it took Tom to sail back. The distance is the same, 30 miles, but the speed is different, 6 miles per hour. We can use the same formula: time = distance / speed = 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.

So, the total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's figure out how many toys Uriah needs to remove from his book bag. We know that his comic books weigh 1/4 pound each and he removed 30 of them. To find the total weight of the comic books, we multiply the number of comic books by their weight: 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, we need to find out how much weight is left to remove. We subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight: 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we know that each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's figure out how much more money the mechanic made on the day he made more money.

The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire. On Thursday, he fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. That's a total of 6 x $60 + 4 x $40. 

6 x $60 = $360
4 x $40 = $160
$360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, he fixed 12 car tires and no truck tires. So, he made 12 x $40.

12 x $40 = $480

Now, we need to find out which day he made more money. Thursday's money is $520 and Friday's money is $480. Since $520 is more than $480, Thursday is the day he made more money.

To find out how much more money he made on Thursday, we subtract Friday's money from Thursday's money.

$520 - $480 = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"Let's count the kittens. The Doubtfire sisters have 7 kittens from the animal shelter. Then, their mom calls and says that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, had kittens too.

Patchy had three times as many kittens as the Doubtfire sisters had. Since they had 7 kittens, Patchy had 3 x 7 = 21 kittens.

Trixie had 12 kittens.

To find the total number of kittens, we add the kittens from the shelter, Patchy, and Trixie: 7 + 21 + 12 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's figure out how many bags Jean can fill with lollipops. 

First, we need to know how many lollipops Jean has left after eating 2. We can find this out by subtracting 2 from 30.

30 - 2 = 28

Now, we need to find out how many bags Jean can fill with 28 lollipops. Since each bag has 2 lollipops, we can divide 28 by 2.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with lollipops.

The final answer is: 14"
"To figure out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to know how much money he has and how much it costs to go to the movies. Peter has $42 and it costs $14 to go to the movies (that's $7 for a ticket and $7 for popcorn).

To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to divide the money he has by the cost of one trip to the movies. This is called division.

42 ÷ 14 = ?

To do this, we can use long division or a calculator. Let's use a calculator.

42 ÷ 14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times."
"To find out how many boxes can fit on the truck, we need to know how much weight the truck can hold and how much each box weighs. The bridge can only hold 5000 pounds. The driver and the empty truck weigh 3755 pounds. So, we need to subtract that from the bridge's weight limit to find out how much weight is left for the boxes.

5000 (bridge's weight limit) - 3755 (driver and empty truck) = 1245 pounds

Now, we need to divide the remaining weight by the weight of each box, which is 15 pounds.

1245 pounds / 15 pounds per box = 83 boxes

So, the truck can hold 83 boxes."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, we need to find 25% of $40.00. 25% is the same as 0.25. So, we multiply 0.25 by $40.00.

0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00

Now, we add the 25% fee to the final bill:

$40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

Next, we add the delivery fee of $3.00:

$50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

Finally, we add the tip of $4.00:

$53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to add the number of raspberries in the clusters to the number of individual raspberries. 

First, we find the total number of raspberries in the clusters: 
6 clusters * 20 raspberries per cluster = 6 × 20 = 120 raspberries

Then, we add the number of individual raspberries to the total number of raspberries in the clusters: 
120 raspberries + 67 raspberries = 120 + 67 = 187 raspberries

"Let's solve the problem. We have 25 oranges in total. We know that 1 orange is bad and 2 oranges are sour. We also know that 20% of the oranges are unripe. 

To find 20% of 25, we multiply 25 by 0.2 (which is the same as 20%).
25 x 0.2 = 5 oranges are unripe.

Now, we add the number of bad and unripe oranges to find the total number of oranges that are not good.
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) = 6 oranges are not good.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges.
25 (total) - 6 (not good) = 19 oranges are good.

"So, Janet bought a brooch for her daughter. She paid $500 for the material and $800 for the jeweler to make it. Then, she paid 10% of the total cost to get it insured. To find the total amount she paid, we need to add the cost of the material and the cost of the jeweler, and then add 10% of that total to get the insurance cost.

First, we add the cost of the material and the cost of the jeweler: $500 + $800 = $1300.

Next, we need to find 10% of $1300. To do this, we multiply $1300 by 0.1 (since 10% is the same as 0.1). So, 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

So, Janet paid a total of $1430 for the brooch."
"Let's figure out Marcy's annual pension after 30 years.

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only gets the full pension for 10 years. For the remaining 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension.

The full pension is $50,000 per year. So, for 10 years, she gets 10 x $50,000 = $500,000.

Now, we need to find 5% of $500,000. To do that, we multiply $500,000 by 0.05. That's $500,000 x 0.05 = $25,000.

So, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000 (for the first 10 years) + $25,000 (for the remaining 20 years) = $75,000.

The final answer is: $75,000."
"To find out how much Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

The first half of the year is 6 months, and the second half of the year is also 6 months. 

The streaming service costs $140 per month. 

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, she paid 10% less than the initial amount. To find 10% of $140, we multiply $140 by 0.1, which is $14. Then, we subtract $14 from $140 to get 90% of $140, which is $126.

For the second half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $126 = $756.

To find the total amount she paid, we add the two amounts together: $840 + $756 = $1596.

The final answer is: $1596"
"To figure out how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to know how many miles her car can go on one gallon of gas. We can find this out by dividing the distance she traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used (4 gallons).

Distance ÷ Gas used = Miles per gallon
100 miles ÷ 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know her car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can find out how far she can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the miles per gallon.

Miles per gallon × Tank capacity = Total miles
25 miles/gallon × 12 gallons = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, Jim watches TV for 2 hours. Then, he reads for half as long, which is 2 / 2 = 1 hour. So, in one day, he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours watching TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, we multiply 3 hours by 3 to get 9 hours per week. 

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in 4 weeks. We multiply 9 hours by 4 to get 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"So, there are 4 schools going to a basketball tournament. Each school has a girls' team and a boys' team, and each team has 5 players. Plus, each school has a coach for each team. 

To find the total number of people, we need to add up the number of students and coaches. There are 2 teams per school, and each team has 5 players, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 players per school. And each school has 2 coaches. 

So, the total number of people per school is 10 (players) + 2 (coaches) = 12.

Since there are 4 schools, we multiply 12 by 4 to get the total number of people. 12 x 4 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's figure out how many gems are in the treasure chest. 

We know there are 175 diamonds. The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so we need to subtract 35 from 175 to find the number of rubies. 

175 - 35 = 140 rubies

Now, we know there are twice as many emeralds as rubies. To find the number of emeralds, we multiply the number of rubies by 2.

140 x 2 = 280 emeralds

To find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together.

175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595

The final answer is: 595"
"Let's figure this out. We know there are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 girls, that means there are 2 x 60 = 120 boys.

To find the total number of students, we add the number of boys and girls together: 60 + 120 = 180.

Now, we know there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by 5.

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
= 180 / 5
= 36

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's figure out how much money Bailey started with.

Bailey gets a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. To find out how much she got in total from her allowance, we multiply the amount she gets each week by the number of weeks:

$5/week × 8 weeks = $40

Now, we know that at the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. To find out how much she started with, we need to subtract the amount she got from her allowance from the total amount she has:

$100 - $40 = $60

So, Bailey started with $60."
"To find out how much Judy makes in a week, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to find out how many classes she teaches in a week. She teaches 5 classes a day for 5 days, which is 5 x 5 = 25 classes. Then, she teaches 8 classes on Saturday. So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Now, we need to find out how many students she teaches in a week. Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students per week is 33 x 15 = 495 students.

Judy charges $15 per student, so the total amount she makes in a week is 495 x $15 = $7425.

The final answer is: $7425"
"To find the total number of instructions, we need to add the number of instructions in the first recipe to the number of instructions in the second recipe.

The first recipe has 20 instructions. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 2 x 20 = 40 instructions.

Now, we add the number of instructions in both recipes: 20 + 40 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total amount from the brownies and the total amount from the cheesecakes, then add them together.

First, let's find the total amount from the brownies. We multiply the number of brownies by the price of each brownie: 43 brownies * $3 per brownie = $129.

Next, we find the total amount from the cheesecakes. We multiply the number of cheesecakes by the price of each cheesecake: 23 cheesecakes * $4 per cheesecake = $92.

Now, we add the two amounts together: $129 + $92 = $221.

The final answer is: $221"
"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we need to first find the total cost of the cell phones. 

The cost of one cell phone is $150. Since Shiela bought 5 cell phones, we multiply 150 by 5 to get the total cost. 

150 × 5 = $750

Now, we need to find out how much interest Shiela will pay. The interest is 2% of the cost of one cell phone. To find 2% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.02.

150 × 0.02 = $3

Since Shiela bought 5 cell phones, we multiply the interest by 5 to get the total interest.

3 × 5 = $15

Now, we add the total interest to the total cost of the cell phones to get the total amount Shiela will pay.

$750 + $15 = $765

Since Shiela is paying in installments for 3 months, we need to divide the total cost by 3 to find the monthly payment.

$765 ÷ 3 = $255

The final answer is: $255"
"Let's figure out how much money Artie will make from his flower stand.

First, we need to round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar. 

Marigolds cost $2.74 per pot, so we round that to $3.
Petunias cost $1.87 per pot, so we round that to $2.
Begonias cost $2.12 per pot, so we round that to $2.

Now, let's multiply the rounded price by the number of pots sold for each type of flower:

Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Now, let's add the amounts together to find the total:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

The final answer is: $88"
"So, Luke is building a sandcastle with 4 levels, and each level has half the square footage of the one below it. The top level has 16 square feet. 

To find the square footage of the other levels, we can just divide the top level's square footage by 2. So, the second level has 16 / 2 = 8 square feet. Then, the third level has 8 / 2 = 4 square feet. And the fourth level has 4 / 2 = 2 square feet.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"Let's figure out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year.

First, we need to find out how much dog food the puppy will eat in the first year. The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. That's 180 cups of dog food.

Then, the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of the year. There are 365 days in a year, and the puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days, so it eats 2 cups of dog food for 365 - 180 = 185 days.

So, the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food for 185 days, which is 2 x 185 = 370 cups.

Now, we add the dog food eaten in the first 180 days and the dog food eaten in the rest of the year. That's 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Each bag of dog food has 110 cups. To find out how many bags Cecilia will use, we divide the total cups of dog food by the cups in each bag: 550 ÷ 110 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's figure out the difference in laundry that Raymond and David do.

We know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. We also know that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. To find out how much laundry David does, we need to divide 400 by 4.

400 ÷ 4 = 100

So, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

Now, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. To find out how much laundry Raymond does, we need to divide 400 by 2.

400 ÷ 2 = 200

So, Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.

To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we need to subtract David's laundry from Raymond's laundry.

200 - 100 = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's figure out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

First, we need to find out which package of flowers is cheaper. We can do this by dividing the cost of each package by the number of flowers in it.

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost is $2.50. To find the cost per flower, we divide $2.50 by 3:

$2.50 ÷ 3 = $0.8333 per flower

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost is $1. To find the cost per flower, we divide $1 by 2:

$1 ÷ 2 = $0.50 per flower

Since $0.50 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. We can do this by dividing 18 by 2 (since we're buying 2 flowers per package):

18 ÷ 2 = 9

So, we need 9 packages of 2 flowers. The cost of each package is $1, so we multiply 9 by $1:

9 × $1 = $9

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers. We can do this by dividing 18 by 3 (since we're buying 3 flowers per package):

18 ÷ 3 = 6

So, we need 6 packages of 3 flowers. The cost of each package is $2.50, so we multiply 6 by $2.50:

6 × $2.50 = $15

To find out how much money Vincent saves, we subtract the cost of the better price from the cost of the more expensive option:

$15 - $9 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"So, John takes his dog to the groomer and it costs $100. But, the groomer gives him a 30% discount because he's a new customer. To find out how much it costs after the discount, we need to find 30% of $100 and subtract it from $100.

To find 30% of $100, we multiply $100 by 0.3 (since 30% is the same as 30/100 or 0.3).

$100 x 0.3 = $30

Now, we subtract $30 from $100 to find the cost after the discount.

$100 - $30 = $70

So, the grooming costs $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much water the girls got. Since they each got 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can multiply 24 by 1/6.

24 liters * (1/6) = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they got a total of 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Now, let's think about the boy. He got 6 liters of water.

To find out how much water is left, we need to subtract the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy from the initial amount of water.

Total water taken = 8 (by girls) + 6 (by boy) = 14 liters

Now, let's subtract the total water taken from the initial amount of water. 
Water left = 24 - 14 = 10 liters

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Charlie starts with 10 stickers. Then he buys 21 more stickers, so he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

Next, he gets 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

After that, he gives 9 stickers to his sister, so he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers left.

Finally, he uses 28 stickers to decorate a card, so he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left.

So, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find Alex's weight, we need to multiply Grace's weight by 4 and then subtract 2 pounds from that result. 

Grace weighs 125 pounds. 

First, we multiply 125 by 4: 4 × 125 = 500 pounds. 

Now, we subtract 2 pounds from 500: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds. 

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds. 

To find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: 623"
"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 × 25 = 75
Then, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 × 8 = 600

The total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's solve the problem. We know that the football team played 22 games in total. They won 8 more games than they lost. Let's call the number of games they lost ""L"" and the number of games they won ""W"".

We can write an equation to represent the situation: W = L + 8 (since they won 8 more games than they lost)

We also know that the total number of games they played is 22, so W + L = 22.

Now, we can substitute W from the first equation into the second equation: (L + 8) + L = 22

Combine like terms: 2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2: L = 7

Now that we know L, we can find W: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

So, the team won 15 games.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's figure out how many quilt blocks Gene has. Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene goes on 4 vacations per year, we need to multiply the number of years he's been vacationing by the number of vacations he goes on each year. This is like multiplying 11 years by 4 vacations/year.

11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks

The final answer is: 44"
"So, let's figure out how many times the alarm rang. The first time it went off, it rang 4 times. That's easy.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, we multiply 4 by 3 to find out how many times it rang the second time. 4 x 3 = 12.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. To find out how many times it rang, we divide 12 by 2. 12 ÷ 2 = 6.

Now, we need to add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's salary after three more years of service, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to find out how much her salary will be after 5 years. We know that her salary is $600 and it increases by 10% every year. 

To find 10% of $600, we multiply 0.1 by 600. That's 0.1 x 600 = $60. 

Now, we add $60 to $600 to get her salary after 1 year. That's $600 + $60 = $660. We do this 4 more times to find her salary after 5 years. 

$660 + $66 = $726
$726 + $72.6 = $798.6
$798.6 + $79.86 = $878.46
$878.46 + $87.85 = $966.31

So, her salary after 5 years is $966.31. Now, we need to find her salary after 3 more years. We do the same thing again. 

$966.31 + $96.63 = $1062.94
$1062.94 + $106.29 = $1169.23
$1169.23 + $116.92 = $1286.15

The final answer is: $1286.15"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If we let H be the number of copies Harald sold, then Marilyn sold 10H copies.

We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000. So, we can write an equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Now, we need to find out how many copies Harald sold. To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 11:

H = 88,000 ÷ 11
H = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to know how many gift bags she needs. Since 1/4 of the guests won't show up, we need to find 3/4 of the total number of guests.

Let's do that: 16 (total guests) - 1/4 of 16 = 16 - 4 = 12

Now, we need to find 3/4 of 16. We can do that by multiplying 16 by 3 and then dividing by 4.

(16 * 3) / 4 = 48 / 4 = 12

So, 3/4 of 16 is 12. But we already found that out earlier. We know 12 guests will show up. Now, we need to find out how many gift bags Christina needs. She needs 0.75 gift bags per guest.

12 (guests) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

9 (gift bags) * $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

"To find out how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles, we need to know how fast he used to run and how much faster he got after changing his diet.

We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. We also know that Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald used to run. So, Gerald used to run 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%. To find 10% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.1. That's 40 * 0.1 = 4 seconds.

Since Gerald's speed improved by 4 seconds, we subtract 4 from his original time. So, Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's figure out how many pets are in the neighborhood.

We know that there are 60 dogs. Since there are 2 cats for every dog, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2. So, the number of cats is 2 x 60 = 120.

Now, we need to find the combined number of dogs and cats. We add the number of dogs and cats together: 60 + 120 = 180.

The problem says that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we subtract 12 from 180 to find the number of rabbits: 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together: 60 + 120 + 168 = 348.

"To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we need to know how many girls there are and how many of them are in the girl scout.

First, let's find out how many girls there are. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys, so the rest must be girls. We can set up an equation to find the number of girls:

Total students = 200
Boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Girls = Total students - Boys = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find out how many girls are in the girl scout, we multiply the number of girls by 2/3:

Girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Now, to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

Girls not in the girl scout = Total girls - Girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"Let's figure out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

We know that 5 cars took an exit, so there were 30 - 5 = 25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.

We also know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes. Let's call the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes 'x'. Then, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:
x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

1000 ÷ 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy placed 250 pieces. 

1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Then, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. 

To find a third of 750, we can divide 750 by 3.

750 ÷ 3 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after her mom placed 250 pieces. 

750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

"Let's figure out how many cookies Cody and Amir eat together.

We know that Amir eats 5 cookies. Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. To find out how many cookies Cody eats, we multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3.

5 cookies (Amir's cookies) × 3 = 15 cookies (Cody's cookies)

Now, we need to add the number of cookies Amir eats and the number of cookies Cody eats to find the total number of cookies they eat together.

5 (Amir's cookies) + 15 (Cody's cookies) = 20 cookies

So, Cody and Amir eat a total of 20 cookies together.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the inner volume of the boxes, we need to know the dimensions of the inner space. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from the length, width, and height of each box.

The length of the box is 5 inches, so the inner length is 5 - 2 = 3 inches.

The width of the box is 6 inches, so the inner width is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.

The height of the box is 4 inches, so the inner height is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3: 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"Let's figure out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday.

We know that Frankie watched TV for a total of 7 hours. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour of a 1-hour show and 0.5 hours of a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

So, the total time he spent watching 1-hour episodes is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. To find out how much time he spent watching 30-minute episodes, we subtract 5.5 from 7, which is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched by dividing 1.5 by 0.5. This is 1.5 ÷ 0.5 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's figure out how many cookies Henry baked last year.

So, Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. Let's call the number of cookies he baked last year ""x"". This year, he wants to make 2x cookies.

But, he accidentally baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. So, the total number of cookies he actually baked is 2x + 15.

After that, he dropped 5 cookies, and now he has 110 cookies left. We can write an equation to represent this situation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the 15 and the -5. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation and subtracting 15 from both sides. This gives us:

2x = 110 + 5 - 15
2x = 100

Now, we need to get x by itself. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 100 ÷ 2
x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"So, let's figure out how much gas will cost after the cashback rewards. 

First, we need to know how much gas costs and how much cashback we get. The gas costs $3.00 per gallon, and we get $0.20 cashback per gallon.

If we buy 10 gallons of gas, we need to multiply the cost per gallon by the number of gallons. That's 10 x $3.00 = $30.00.

Now, we need to find out how much cashback we get. We get $0.20 cashback per gallon, so we multiply that by the number of gallons: 10 x $0.20 = $2.00.

To find out how much we pay after the cashback rewards, we subtract the cashback from the total cost: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to know how many they each ate. We can do this by multiplying the number of roll-ups wide by the number of roll-ups long for each.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 roll-ups long = 2 x 24 = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 3 x 14 = 42 roll-ups

Now, we need to add the number of roll-ups eaten by each and divide by 2 to find the average.

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 ÷ 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"Let's figure out how much water the boat took on. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it rows back towards the shore. It took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. 

First, we need to find out how many feet Julia rows per second. To do this, we can divide the distance she rowed (20 feet) by the time it took her (16 seconds). 

20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second

Now, we need to find out how many seconds it will take Julia to row to the shore. We know it's 64 seconds away. 

Since we know how many feet Julia rows per second, we can multiply this rate by the total time to find the total distance: 

1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows. We can do this by dividing the total distance by 10: 

80 feet / 10 = 8 sets

Since each set takes on 2 liters of water, we can multiply the number of sets by 2: 

8 sets * 2 liters/set = 16 liters

The final answer is: 16"
"So, let's figure this out. There are 4 teachers, and each teacher has 2 lessons per day. That means there are 4 x 2 = 8 lessons in a day. Now, we need to know how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in each lesson. It's given that the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we multiply the number of lessons by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson. So, 8 lessons x 3 cleanings per lesson = 24 cleanings.

The final answer is: 24"
"So, Ryan plants 2 flowers a day in his garden. We need to find out how many flowers he has after 15 days. To do this, we need to multiply the number of flowers he plants each day by the number of days.

2 flowers/day * 15 days = 2 * 15 = 30 flowers

But, 5 of these flowers didn't grow. So, we need to subtract 5 from the total number of flowers.

30 - 5 = 25

So, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's figure out how many ducks are in Jamal's photograph.

We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. We also know that his phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. To find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold, we need to divide 1800 by 6.

1800 ÷ 6 = 300

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs. Now, we know that the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. To find out how many ducks are in the photograph, we need to divide 300 by 50.

300 ÷ 50 = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's figure out how much profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber.

First, we need to find out how much Sasha paid for the lumber. She bought 10 boards that are 2 x 4 x 10 and 5 boards that are 4 x 4 x 10. 

The 2 x 4 x 10 boards cost $10 each, so 10 boards cost 10 x $10 = $100. The 4 x 4 x 10 boards cost $16 each, so 5 boards cost 5 x $16 = $80. 

So, Sasha paid a total of $100 + $80 = $180 for the lumber.

Now, we need to find out how much she can sell the lumber for. Prices have gone up by 50%, which means the new price is 1.5 times the old price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 x 1.5 = $15 each. The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 x 1.5 = $24 each.

Sasha has 10 of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, so she can sell them for 10 x $15 = $150. She has 5 of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, so she can sell them for 5 x $24 = $120.

So, Sasha can sell all her lumber for $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost from the selling price. The profit is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find out how many teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to know the ratio of sugar to water. The ratio is 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. 

The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20. To find out how many teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to find out how many groups of 20 parts are in 120 teaspoonfuls. We can do this by dividing 120 by 20, which is 6.

Now, we know that 1 group of 20 parts has 7 parts of sugar. So, 6 groups of 20 parts will have 6 x 7 = 42 parts of sugar.

"To find out how much John paid for the shoes, we need to multiply the number of pairs of shoes he bought for each child by the cost of each pair, and then multiply that by the number of children.

First, we find the cost of the shoes for one child: 2 pairs * $60 = $120.

Then, we multiply this by the number of children: $120 * 3 = $360.

So, John paid a total of $360 for the shoes."
"Let's figure out how many containers were brought in on the second day. We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each on the first day. That's a total of 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles.

Now, we know that on the second day, there were 30 vehicles in total. So, the number of vehicles that were brought in on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers by dividing the number of vehicles by 5. That's 20 ÷ 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's figure out the problem step by step.

First, we know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. This means Lylah's salary was 70% of Adrien's salary. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, then Lylah's salary four years ago was 70% of $40000. To find 70% of $40000, we multiply 0.7 by $40000.

0.7 × $40000 = $28000

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was $28000.

Next, we need to find out how much Adrien's salary increased. His salary increased by 40% of his old salary. To find 40% of $40000, we multiply 0.4 by $40000.

0.4 × $40000 = $16000

Now, we add this increase to Adrien's old salary to find his new salary.

$40000 + $16000 = $56000

Lylah's salary also increased by 40% of her old salary. To find 40% of $28000, we multiply 0.4 by $28000.

0.4 × $28000 = $11200

Now, we add this increase to Lylah's old salary to find her new salary.

$28000 + $11200 = $39200

To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries.

$56000 + $39200 = $95200

The final answer is: $95200"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to know how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Each pad has 30 sheets of paper. So, we multiply 2 pads by 30 sheets to get the total sheets used in a week: 2 x 30 = 60 sheets.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the sheets used in a week by 4 to get the total sheets used in a month: 60 x 4 = 240 sheets.

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's figure out how many fruits Morisette and Kael have in total.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael brought twice the number of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. Kael also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 ÷ 2 = 4 oranges.

To find the total number of fruits Morisette brought, we add the number of apples and oranges: 5 + 8 = 13.

To find the total number of fruits Kael brought, we add the number of apples and oranges: 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, we add the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought to find the total number of fruits they have: 13 + 14 = 27.

"To find out how many hours Sadie slept in a week, we need to add up the hours she slept each day.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours. 

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Let's count the hours she slept for each day:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Now, let's add up the hours: 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 48

"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts. First, we know she runs 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. We can find the distance she runs in this time by multiplying the speed by the time.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, we need to find out how much time is left. We know she runs for 7 hours in total, and she already ran for 3 hours. So, the time left is:

Time left = Total time - Time already run
Time left = 7 hours - 3 hours
Time left = 4 hours

Next, we know she runs 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours. We can find the distance she runs in this time by multiplying the speed by the time.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, we add the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour to get the total distance.

Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"Let's figure out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

We know that Jennie has a pile of 60 letters that need stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of those letters. To find one-third of 60, we can divide 60 by 3.

60 ÷ 3 = 20

So, Jennie stamps 20 letters. Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that before Jennie started, there were 30 - 20 = 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Julia bought a package of spoons, and then her husband gave her 5 more spoons. After that, she used 3 spoons. When she set the table, she had 12 spoons left.

Let's say the number of spoons Julia bought is x. We can make an equation to solve for x.

x + 5 (the spoons her husband gave her) - 3 (the spoons she used) = 12 (the spoons she had left)

We can simplify this equation by combining the numbers: x + 2 = 12

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation.

x = 12 - 2
x = 10

So, Julia bought 10 spoons.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages.

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

Now, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's figure out how much money Dillon will spend at the store.

First, we need to know the cost of each item. We know that a pepper costs $15. 

Since a watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs, we multiply the cost of a pepper by 3 to find the cost of a watermelon: 3 × $15 = $45.

Next, we need to find the cost of an orange. We know that an orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so we subtract 5 from the cost of a watermelon: $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we know the cost of each item. Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so the total cost of watermelons is 4 × $45 = $180.

Dillon also buys 20 peppers, so the total cost of peppers is 20 × $15 = $300.

Finally, Dillon buys 10 oranges, so the total cost of oranges is 10 × $40 = $400.

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we add the cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges together: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many hours the doctors work in a day. We know the hospital sees 500 people a day, and each person is seen for 24 minutes. To find the total time, we multiply the number of people by the time per person.

500 people * 24 minutes/person = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total minutes to hours.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Now, we know the doctors work for 200 hours a day. The doctors charge $150 an hour, so we multiply the hours by the hourly rate to find the total cost.

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Next, we need to find the total amount of money the hospital makes from the patients. We know the hospital charges $200 an hour, and each person is seen for 24 minutes. We need to convert the time to hours first.

24 minutes / 60 = 0.4 hours

Now, we multiply the number of people by the time per person in hours and the hourly rate.

500 people * 0.4 hours/person * $200/hour = 200 * $200/hour = $40000

The hospital makes $40000 from the patients. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $40000 - $30000
Profit = $10000

The final answer is: $10000"

First, we need to find out how many miles he walked on Tuesday. We know he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday. Since he walked 4 miles on Monday, we multiply 4 by 6 to find out how many miles he walked on Tuesday: 4 × 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we need to add these miles to the total miles he walked from Monday to Wednesday, which is 41 miles. So, we subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles: 41 - (4 + 24) = 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

3 times Brian's remaining video games is 3 × 15 = 45.

Now, we subtract 5 from 45: 45 - 5 = 40.

So, Bobby has 40 video games."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to do some simple math. 

First, we need to find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are there, we can divide 27 by 3. 

27 ÷ 3 = 9

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. 

Now, we need to find out how many of those unicorns are female. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3.

(2/3) × 9 = (2 × 9) ÷ 3

= 6

So, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns."
"Let's figure out how much Rory's delivery order will cost.

First, we need to add up the cost of all the food. Rory ordered 2 subs for $7.50 each, 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each, and 2 cookies for $1.00 each.

2 subs for $7.50 each is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
2 bags of chips for $1.50 each is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
2 cookies for $1.00 each is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

Now, let's add up the cost of all the food: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add a 20% delivery fee. To do this, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20 (which is the same as 20%): $20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00

Now, we add the delivery fee to the cost of the food: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip. So, we add the tip to the total cost: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark took a test with 75 questions and another test with 100 questions. He finished the first test in 8 hours and the second test in 6 hours. We know he answers 5 questions per hour.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to finish 75 questions. Since he answers 5 questions per hour, we can find out how many questions he finished by multiplying 8 hours by 5 questions per hour: 8 × 5 = 40 questions.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to finish 100 questions. We can find out how many questions he finished by multiplying 6 hours by 5 questions per hour: 6 × 5 = 30 questions.

Now, let's add the questions Mark finished in both tests: 40 + 30 = 70 questions.

To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to subtract the questions he finished from the total number of questions in both tests. The total number of questions is 75 + 100 = 175 questions.

So, the number of questions Mark left incomplete is 175 - 70 = 105.

Let's say the number of queens is Q. Since there are twice as many babies as queens, the number of babies is 2Q. And since there are twice as many worker bees as babies, the number of worker bees is 2(2Q), which is 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write an equation: Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. 

Combining like terms, we get 7Q = 700. 

To find Q, we divide both sides by 7: Q = 700 ÷ 7 = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find the number of babies: 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

And we can find the number of worker bees: 4Q = 4(100) = 400.

So, there are 400 worker bees.

The final answer is: 400"
"If Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, that means he has 2 extra hours each day to work. If he works those 2 hours, he would earn money. He earns $10 an hour.

To find out how much money he would earn in a week, we need to multiply the number of hours he works in a week by his hourly wage. There are 7 days in a week, so he would work 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours in a week.

So, the calculation would be: 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of the food items. The food items are milk and eggs. The cost of milk is $2 and the cost of eggs is $3. To find the total cost of food items, we add these two numbers together:

$2 + $3 = $5

Next, we need to find the total cost of the non-food items. The non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. The cost of light bulbs is $3, the cost of cups is $3, and the cost of roach traps is $4. To find the total cost of non-food items, we add these three numbers together:

$3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Now, we need to find the tax on the non-food items. The tax is 10% of the cost of the non-food items. To find 10% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.1. So, the tax on the non-food items is:

$10 x 0.1 = $1

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the non-food items:

$10 + $1 = $11

Finally, we add the cost of the food items and the non-food items with tax to find the total cost:

$5 + $11 = $16

The final answer is: $16"
"To find out how much profit Kim will make each week, we need to know how much money he gets from his clients and how much it costs him to clean their houses.

Kim has 8 clients in total. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, and the cost of cloths is $5 per pack. 

First, let's find out how much bleach and cloths Kim needs in total:

Bleach: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Cloths: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

Now, let's calculate the cost of bleach and cloths:

Bleach cost: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
Cloths cost: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

The total cost is the sum of the bleach cost and the cloths cost: $32 + $40 = $72.

Kim's total income is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"Let's figure out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year.

First, we need to know how many pineapples are in one hectare. John has 10 hectares, and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. To find the total number of pineapples, we multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of hectares:

100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Now, we need to know how many times John can harvest his pineapples in a year. Since he can harvest every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year, we divide 12 by 3 to find the number of harvests:

12 months/year ÷ 3 months/harvest = 4 harvests/year

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests:

1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

The final answer is: 4000"
"So, Johnny has three Lego sets. The first one has 500 pieces. The second one has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces. The third one has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 500 ÷ 4 = 125 pieces.

To find the total number of pieces, we need to add the number of pieces in each set together: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

The final answer is: 2125"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, half of those bees return. Half of 30 is 15, so 15 bees return.

Now, let's think about the bees that left the hive in the first 6 hours. We know 15 of them came back, so 30 - 15 = 15 bees didn't come back yet.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees leave the hive as left in the first 6 hours. Twice as many as 30 is 60, so 60 bees leave the hive.

Now, let's think about all the bees that left the hive. We know 30 left in the first 6 hours and 60 left in the next 6 hours, so that's a total of 30 + 60 = 90 bees. But we know 15 of those bees came back, so 90 - 15 = 75 bees didn't come back yet.

Finally, in the last 6 hours, all the bees that left the hive before that and hadn't come back yet return to the hive. That's 75 bees.

The final answer is: 75"
"So, Brittany and her mom went to the museum. The museum charges $12 for adults and $10 for kids. Brittany's mom paid for 1 adult ticket and 1 kid ticket. When she got her change, she got $8 back. We need to figure out how much money she gave the cashier.

First, we need to add the cost of the adult ticket and the kid ticket. 

$12 (adult ticket) + $10 (kid ticket) = $22

Since she got $8 back, we need to add that to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier.

$22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"Let's figure out how many friends James has on Facebook.

We know that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook. We also know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy. So, if we divide 12 by 3, we can find out how many friends Dorothy has.

12 ÷ 3 = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

Now, we know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. To find out how many friends James has, we multiply the number of friends Dorothy has by 4.

4 × 4 = 16

So, James has 16 friends on Facebook.

The final answer is: 16"
"To figure out who wins the race, we need to find out how long it takes Steve and Tim to get home from school.

Steve lives 3 miles away from school. Since 1 mile is 5280 feet, Steve lives 3 x 5280 = 15840 feet away. He can bike at 440 feet per minute.

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 15840 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 36 minutes

Tim lives 2 miles away from school, which is 2 x 5280 = 10560 feet. He can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute.

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve
Difference in time = 40 - 36
Difference in time = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find out how much money Shawnda made, we need to add up the cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's figure out how many bicycle tires she inflated. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 x 2 = 10.

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 x 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 x 3 = 9.

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 x 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 x 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 x 25 cents = $0.25.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"Let's figure out how much change Carl gets when he buys cookies.

Carl buys 10 packs of cookies. Each pack has 6 cookies inside. Each cookie costs $0.10. To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack and then multiply that by the cost per cookie.

10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies
60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Now, Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find the change, we need to subtract the total cost from the $10 bill.

$10 - $6 = $4

So, Carl gets $4 in change.

The final answer is: $4"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we know that Dave ate 14 french fries. Then a seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries. So, the total number of fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21.

Next, three pigeons came and ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 x 3 = 9 fries. Now, the total number of fries eaten is 21 + 9 = 30.

Let's say the total number of fries in the pack was x. After the pigeons ate, there were x - 30 fries left. A raccoon then ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3)(x - 30). This means that (1/3)(x - 30) fries were left after the raccoon ate.

After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, we can write the equation (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6. Then, we multiply both sides by 3: x - 30 = 18. Finally, we add 30 to both sides: x = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's figure out how many hours Kimo spends in class. 

Kimo goes to school 3 days a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) and has 3 classes each day that last 1 hour. So, that's 3 x 1 = 3 hours per day for those days. Since there are 3 days, that's 3 x 3 = 9 hours per week for those days.

Kimo also goes to school 2 days a week (Tuesday, Thursday) and has 2 classes each day that last 2 hours. So, that's 2 x 2 = 4 hours per day for those days. Since there are 2 days, that's 4 x 2 = 8 hours per week for those days.

To find the total hours per week, we add the hours from both sets of days: 9 + 8 = 17 hours per week.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, we multiply the total hours per week by the number of weeks: 17 x 16 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's find the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: There are 300 rolls, and each roll is 4 inches long. So, the total length of the rolls is 300 x 4 = 1200 inches.
- Croissants: There are 120 croissants, and each croissant is 6 inches long. So, the total length of the croissants is 120 x 6 = 720 inches.
- Baguettes: There are 60 baguettes, and each baguette is 24 inches long (since there are 12 inches in a foot). So, the total length of the baguettes is 60 x 24 = 1440 inches.

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12:

3360 ÷ 12 = 280 feet

The final answer is: 280"
"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate how many bananas each type of ape eats in 2 months.

Monkeys eat 200 bananas per month, so in 2 months, they eat 200 x 2 = 400 bananas.

Gorillas eat 400 bananas per month, so in 2 months, they eat 400 x 2 = 800 bananas.

Baboons eat 100 bananas per month, so in 2 months, they eat 100 x 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add up the bananas each type of ape eats: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"Let's figure out who ran farther and by how much.

First, we need to find out how far each person ran. Blake ran back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he ran back and forth, we multiply the number of times he ran by 2 (for the back and forth part) and then by 100 (the length of the field). So, Blake ran 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Now, let's look at Kelly. She ran back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then she ran to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She did this 34 times, so we multiply 80 by 34 to get 2720 yards. Then we add the 200 yards she ran back and forth, which is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Now that we know how far each person ran, we can see that Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards. Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"

"Let's figure out how many fish Anakin and Locsin caught at the beach.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. To find the total number of fish he caught, we need to add these numbers together.

10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish) = 19

Now, let's find out how many fish Locsin caught. He caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. He caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. He caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish) = 13

To find the total number of fish they caught, we need to add the number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin.

19 (Anakin's fish) + 13 (Locsin's fish) = 32

"To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price.

The original price of a bag of marbles is $20. The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

Let's calculate the price after 36 months:

After 2 months, the price will be:
$20 + ($20 * 0.20) = $20 + $4 = $24

After 4 months, the price will be:
$24 + ($24 * 0.20) = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

After 6 months, the price will be:
$28.80 + ($28.80 * 0.20) = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

We can see a pattern here. The price is increasing by $4, $4.80, $5.76, and so on. This is because we are multiplying the previous price by 1.20 (1 + 0.20) each time.

Let's try to find a formula to calculate the price after n months:

Price = $20 * (1.20)^(n/2)

We want to find the price after 36 months, so we plug in n = 36:

Price = $20 * (1.20)^(36/2)
= $20 * (1.20)^18

Using a calculator, we get:

Price ≈ $534.95

The final answer is: $534.95"
"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to know how much each one costs. We know that one action figure costs $5 and one red car costs $4. 

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since 3 action figures cost 3 * $5 = $15, the doll also costs $15.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of toy:
- 5 red cars: 5 * $4 = $20
- 3 action figures: 3 * $5 = $15
- 1 doll: $15

To find the total worth of all the toys, we add the costs together: $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

"So, Jackie is trying to decide whether to do her taxes herself or hire an accountant. If she does the taxes herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, which means she'll lose $35 per hour in income. The accountant charges $90.

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to figure out how much money she'll lose by doing the taxes herself and then subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from that.

First, let's calculate the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself:
Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour
= 3 × $35
= $105

Now, let's compare this to the cost of hiring the accountant:
Cost of hiring the accountant = $90

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income she'll lose:
Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. If we let Brooke's age be B, then Seth's age is 2B.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2 and Seth's age will be 2B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write an equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

So, Seth is 16 years old.

The final answer is: 16"

Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. We can multiply 20 miles by 5 to find out how many miles he walks in those 5 days: 20 × 5 = 100 miles.

On Saturday and Sunday, Pancho walks 10 miles a day. There are 2 days in the weekend, so we multiply 10 miles by 2: 10 × 2 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked from Monday to Friday and the miles walked on Saturday and Sunday: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to figure out how much the hat, jacket, and pants cost.

The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. So, we multiply 25 by 3 to find the cost of the jacket: 3 × $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) ÷ 2 = $100 ÷ 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"Let's count the legs of all the creatures Jake sees at the Museum of Entomology. 

First, we need to find out how many legs the spiders have. There are 80 spiders, and each spider has 8 legs. So, we multiply 80 by 8 to get the total number of spider legs: 80 × 8 = 640.

Next, we do the same for the insects. There are 90 insects, and each insect has 6 legs. So, we multiply 90 by 6 to get the total number of insect legs: 90 × 6 = 540.

Now, let's count the legs of the rare mutant invertebrates. There are 3 of them, and each has 10 legs. So, we multiply 3 by 10 to get the total number of invertebrate legs: 3 × 10 = 30.

To find the total number of legs, we add the legs of all the creatures together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210.

The final answer is: 1210"
"Let's figure out the total age of the four birds.

We know that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so we multiply 8 by 2 to find Granny Red's age: 2 × 8 = 16.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so we add 3 to 16 to find Sally Two's age: 16 + 3 = 19.

"So, Jessica has some debts and she wants to pay more than the minimum. She has three debts: student loans, credit card, and a mortgage. The minimum payments are $300, $200, and $500, respectively. But she wants to pay 50% more than that.

To find out how much she pays each month, we need to multiply the minimum payment by 1.5 (which is the same as 50% more). 

- Student loans: $300 × 1.5 = $450
- Credit card: $200 × 1.5 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 × 1.5 = $750

Now, let's add up the increased payments: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

"To find out how long it takes Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to know how long it takes to do each task. 

It takes Billy 1.5 minutes to peel a potato. We can convert 5 seconds to minutes by dividing by 60. 5 ÷ 60 = 1/12 minutes. 

Now, we multiply the time it takes to peel one potato by the total number of potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes. Then, we multiply the time it takes to cut one potato by the total number of potatoes: 60 potatoes * (1/12) minutes/potato = 5 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the time it takes to peel and cut all the potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade for $0.50 per glass, and they get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the total money they make from selling one gallon of lemonade is:

20 glasses/gallon × $0.50/glass = $10/gallon

They made a profit of $25, which means the money they made from selling lemonade minus the money they spent on lemons and sugar is $25. Let's call the number of gallons they sold ""x"". Then, the total money they made is:

Total money made = Number of gallons × $10/gallon
Total money made = x × $10

The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $5. Since they sell each gallon for $10, the money they made from selling lemonade is $10 more than the cost of lemons and sugar per gallon. So, the total money they made is:

Total money made = Number of gallons × ($10 - $5)
Total money made = x × $5

Since they made a profit of $25, we can set up the equation:

x × $5 + Cost of lemons and sugar = $25 + Cost of lemons and sugar
x × $5 + $5x = $25 + $3x

Now, let's simplify the equation:

x × $5 + $5x = $25 + $3x
$5x + $5x = $25 + $3x
$10x = $25 + $3x
$10x - $3x = $25
$7x = $25

Now, let's solve for x:

x = $25 / $7
x = 3.57 (round to two decimal places)

Since they sell 20 glasses per gallon, the total number of glasses they sold is:

Total number of glasses = Number of gallons × 20 glasses/gallon
Total number of glasses = 3.57 × 20
Total number of glasses = 71.4

The cost of lemons per gallon is $3. So, the total cost of lemons is:

Total cost of lemons = Number of gallons × $3
Total cost of lemons = 3.57 × $3
Total cost of lemons = $10.71

The final answer is: $10.71"
"Let's break it down step by step. We know there are 240 people in the race. Out of those, 80 are Japanese. To find out how many Chinese people are in the race, we subtract the number of Japanese people from the total number of people.

240 (total people) - 80 (Japanese people) = 160 (Chinese people)

Now, we know that 60 of the Chinese people are boys. To find out how many Chinese girls there are, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people.

160 (Chinese people) - 60 (Chinese boys) = 100 (Chinese girls)

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's break down Zaid's expenses step by step.

First, Zaid earns 6000 dollars per month. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 × 6000 = 1500 dollars.

Next, he spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 × 6000 = 2000 dollars.

Now, let's subtract the rent and car fuel expenses from his total salary: 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 dollars.

Zaid then donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity, which is 1/2 × 2500 = 1250 dollars.

After donating to charity, he has 2500 - 1250 = 1250 dollars left.

Next, he gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars, which is a total of 200 + 700 = 900 dollars.

Finally, let's subtract the money he gave to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount: 1250 - 900 = 350 dollars.

The final answer is: $350"
"Let's figure out how many crabs Rani, Monic, and Bo have together.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so we need to subtract 4 from 40 to find out how many crabs Monic has. 

40 - 4 = 36

So, Monic has 36 crabs.

Now, we know that Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. To find out how many crabs Rani has, we need to add 10 to 36.

36 + 10 = 46

Now that we know how many crabs each person has, we can add them together to find the total number of crabs.

40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

The final answer is: 122"
"To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to add up how much he made each week. 

First, we need to find out how much he made in the first week. He tutored 5 hours at $10 per hour. To find the total, we multiply the number of hours by the hourly wage:

5 hours * $10/hour = $50

Next, we need to find out how much he made in the second week. He tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour. To find the total, we multiply the number of hours by the hourly wage:

8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add his earnings for the first and second weeks together:

$50 + $80 = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to know how many votes the winner got. Since the winner got 3/4 of the total votes, we can multiply 3/4 by the total number of votes, which is 80.

3/4 * 80 = 60

So, the winner got 60 votes. To find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes.

80 - 60 = 20

The loser got 20 votes.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's figure out how many red roses Fred needs to deliver to Sandra. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. We also know that she ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations.

Let's call the number of white carnations ""x"". Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write an equation: 5x = 200.

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5: 
5x / 5 = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, the number of red roses is 4 times 40, or 4 × 40.

4 × 40 = 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's figure out how old Jean is.

We know that Jean is two years older than Mark. We also know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. Jan is 30 years old.

Two years ago, Jan was 28. We can write an equation to find Mark's age two years ago:
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * Jan's age two years ago + 5
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * 28 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 19

Now, we need to find Mark's current age. We add 2 to Mark's age two years ago:
Mark's current age = 19 + 2
Mark's current age = 21

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:
Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
Jean's age = 21 + 2
Jean's age = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's figure out how much time the faster team will win by.

The well-rounded team has four members, and each of them runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. To find their total time, we need to multiply 55 seconds by 4.

4 x 55 = 220 seconds

Now, let's look at the less well-rounded team. Their first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. The next runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we add up their times: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two teams' times. We subtract the less well-rounded team's time from the well-rounded team's time: 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"Let's figure out how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

First, let's think about the numbers on a six-sided die. The numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. To roll a number greater than 3, Jerry can roll a 4, 5, or 6. That's 3 numbers out of 6, so the chance of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6, which is the same as 1/2 or 50%.

Now, let's think about rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. The chance of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6, or 1/2. The chance of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6, or 1/2. Since these are two separate rolls, we multiply the chances together: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

Now, let's find the difference in chance between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row. We subtract the smaller chance from the bigger chance: 50% - 25% = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's figure out how many apples Jenna and her mom picked. We know that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. If her mom picked 20 apples, we need to find half of that number.

To find half of 20, we can divide 20 by 2. That's the same as asking, ""20 divided by what equals 10?"" We can write that as a math problem: 20 ÷ 2 = 10. So, Jenna picked 10 apples.

Now, we need to find the total number of apples they both picked. We can do that by adding the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked. That's 10 + 20.

10 + 20 = 30

So, Jenna and her mom picked a total of 30 apples.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's figure out how many rats are in each cage.

We know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50.

There's also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among them.

We know that a total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents. So, the number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Now, let's subtract the straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits from the total number of straw pieces. That's 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. Let's say the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r.

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, the total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 6r. We know that this is equal to 90. So, we can set up the equation 6r = 90.

To solve for 'r', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 6. That's r = 90 / 6 = 15. But wait, this is the total number of rats in 3 cages. We want to know how many rats are in each cage, so we need to divide this number by 3.

r = 15 / 3 = 5

So, there are 5 rats in each cage.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much Mandy should pay Benedict, we need to add the interest to the initial amount. 

The initial amount is $100. The interest rate is 2% per month. We need to find the interest for 3 months.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $100 + $2 = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $102 + $2.04 = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

We add the interest for all three months: $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

Now, we add the interest to the initial amount: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

So, Mandy should pay $106.12 to Benedict.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

The trader buys some bags of wheat from a farmer at $20 per bag. He has to pay $2 to transport each bag to the warehouse. Then, he sells all the bags at $30 each and makes a profit of $400.

Let's say the trader buys x bags of wheat. The cost of buying the bags is $20x. The cost of transporting the bags is $2x. So, the total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The trader sells the bags at $30 each, so the total revenue is $30x.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $400. We can write an equation to represent this:

$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$8x = $400

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides by 8:

x = $400 ÷ $8
x = 50

So, the trader bought and sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to add up the cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the tickets, food, and rides. The tickets cost $20.25. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so it's $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75. The rides cost $33 each, and they went on 2 rides, so it's 2 x $33 = $66.

Now, let's add up the costs: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since they split the cost evenly, we need to divide $102 by 3. To do this, we can use division: $102 ÷ 3 = $34.

The final answer is $34."
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to know how many peaches he picks per minute and how many minutes he collects for.

John collects 2 peaches per minute. We know this because the problem says so.

He collects for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes to find out how many minutes he collects for: 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we multiply the number of peaches per minute by the total minutes: 2 peaches/minute x 180 minutes = 360 peaches.

So, John collects 360 peaches.

The final answer is: 360"
"To figure out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to know how much they need per week and then divide that by 7.

First, we know that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. If there are 10 ducks, we multiply 3.5 pounds by 10 to get the total pounds of insects they need per week.

3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Now, we need to divide the total pounds of insects per week by 7 to get the pounds of insects per day.

35 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

So, the ducks need 5 pounds of insects per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year. To find the net change in the number of trees, we need to subtract the number of trees he chops down from the number of trees he plants. So, the net change is 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

Tom starts with 50 trees, so after 10 years, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

Now, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39.

So, the number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"So, let's figure out how many more pink plastic flamingos are out than white plastic flamingos.

First, we know that there were 18 pink flamingos on Friday. Then, the neighbors took back one third of them, which is 18 ÷ 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"Violetta wants to buy new crayons. She needs 5 different colors and has $20 to spend. Each crayon costs $2. Let's see how much change she'll get.

First, we need to find out how many crayons Violetta can buy. We can do this by dividing the money she has by the cost of one crayon.

Number of crayons = Total money ÷ Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 ÷ $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color.

Now, let's find out how much money she'll spend on crayons. We can do this by multiplying the number of crayons she can buy by the cost of one crayon.

Total cost of crayons = Number of crayons × Cost of one crayon
Total cost of crayons = 10 × $2
Total cost of crayons = $20

To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to subtract the total cost of the crayons from the money she has.

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

The final answer is: $0"
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to know that it costs the same as a pencil and an eraser combined. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. 

First, we add the cost of a pencil and an eraser to find the cost of a pen. 
Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. We can do this by multiplying the cost of one pen by 8.
Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8 = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

"Let's figure out how many pounds of carrots won't be used.

We have 200 pounds of carrots and we want to give 2 pounds to each of the 40 restaurants. To find out how many pounds we'll give away, we multiply the number of pounds each restaurant gets by the number of restaurants:

2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 2 * 40 = 80 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many pounds won't be used. We do this by subtracting the pounds we gave away from the total pounds we had:

200 pounds (initial amount) - 80 pounds (pounds given away) = 200 - 80 = 120 pounds

So, 120 pounds of carrots won't be used.

So, there are 6277 kids in Soda."
"Let's figure out how many Pokémon cards Elaine has now.

Elaine starts with 20 Pokémon cards. Then, she collects three times that number in the first month. To find three times 20, we multiply 20 by 3: 20 × 3 = 60.

In the second month, she collects 20 fewer cards than in the first month. So, we subtract 20 from 60: 60 - 20 = 40.

Now, let's find out how many cards she collected in the third month. She collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. To find the combined number, we add 60 and 40: 60 + 40 = 100. Then, we multiply 100 by 2: 100 × 2 = 200.

"Let's figure out how much Mark makes in a week.

Mark edits sentences for two different publishers. He edits the same number of sentences for both publishers, and he edits 1000 sentences in total each week. That means he edits 1000 ÷ 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents for each sentence. So, Mark makes 500 x 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A, which is 2 x 5 = 10 cents per sentence. So, Mark makes 500 x 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we add the money he makes from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

"John gets a $5000 award and a 5% raise at work. He makes $2000 a week. Let's figure out how much he makes in a year.

First, we need to find out how much more he makes each week with the raise. To do this, we find 5% of $2000.

5% of $2000 = 0.05 * 2000 = $100

Now, we add the extra $100 to his weekly salary.

New weekly salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply his new weekly salary by 52 to find out how much he makes in a year.

Total amount made in a year = $2100 * 52

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to find the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples, then add them together.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, we multiply 25 by 40g to find the total weight of the chocolate bars: 25 × 40g = 1000g.

Next, we need to find the weight of the candied apples. We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. So, if a chocolate bar weighs 40g, a candied apple weighs 40g ÷ 2 = 20g.

Now, we multiply the weight of one candied apple by the total number of candied apples, which is 80: 20g × 80 = 1600g.

Finally, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The jacket costs $30 and 2 pairs of shoes cost $20 each, so the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Let's calculate how much more money she needs to earn: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns each time: $40 / $4 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Jerry has red chickens and white chickens. The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. We also know that he has 2 more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's say the number of red chickens is R. Then, the number of white chickens is R + 2.

We can write an equation to represent the total number of eggs collected:

3R (eggs from red chickens) + 5(R + 2) (eggs from white chickens) = 42

First, we multiply 5 by (R + 2):

5R + 10

Now our equation is:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Next, we combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Now, we subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Finally, we divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to know the total distance he walks. Since the park is a rectangle, we can find the distance by adding up all the sides. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

The length of the park is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles. Let's plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(l + w)
P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now that we know the total distance is 15 miles, we can find the time it takes Gary to walk by dividing the distance by his speed. His speed is 3 miles per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's figure out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day.

We know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day. So, on the second day, she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

Now, we know that by the third day, the total number of customers was 500. To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to subtract the total customers on the first two days from the total by the third day.

Let's do the math:

Customers on Day 3 = Total by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - (100 + 150)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - 250
Customers on Day 3 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that both pools are leaking at the same rate, 4 gallons per minute. We also know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Let's call the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago ""x"" gallons. Then, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since 4 minutes have passed, 16 gallons of water have leaked out from both pools. So, the small pool now has x - 4 gallons of water, and the big pool has 2x - 4 gallons of water.

The problem says that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can write an equation to represent this:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

To solve for x, we need to simplify the equation. First, let's distribute the 4 on the right side:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Next, let's add 4 to both sides of the equation:

2x = 4x - 12

Now, let's subtract 4x from both sides:

-2x = -12

Finally, let's divide both sides by -2:

x = 6

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since 4 gallons leaked out, the small pool now has 6 - 4 = 2 gallons of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to know how much money she needs to earn and how much she makes per hour. 

The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. So, the total amount she needs to earn is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Lori makes $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage.

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. This means she has to pay back the original $2000 plus 10% of $2000. To find 10% of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 0.10.

$2000 x 0.10 = $200

So, Janeth has to pay back $2000 + $200 = $2200 in total.

Now, let's see how much she will pay each month. She will pay $165 per month for 12 months. To find the total amount she will pay in 12 months, we multiply $165 by 12.

$165 x 12 = $1980

Now, let's subtract the total amount she will pay ($1980) from the total amount she has to pay back ($2200) to find the remaining balance.

$2200 - $1980 = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"Let's count the flowers in the vase. We know there are 4 roses. We also know there are 7 more dahlias than roses. To find the number of dahlias, we add 7 to the number of roses: 4 + 7 = 11.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to know their current ages and add 3 to each age.

We know Harriet is 21 years old now. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: 
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"Let's figure out how many points Jojo scored in the board game. 

We know that Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of what Naomi scored. To find half of Naomi's points, we divide 68 by 2. 

68 ÷ 2 = 34

So, half of Naomi's points is 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. 

68 + 44 + 85 = 197

We know that all four students scored a total of 251 points. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points.

251 - 197 = 54

So, Jojo scored 54 points.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. We can do this by subtracting 90 from 120.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Now, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. This means she collected 2 times 30 liters.

2 x 30 = 60 liters

So, Celine collected 60 liters of rainwater. To find the total amount of water in the tank now, we add the remaining water and the collected rainwater.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias.

First, we know that Andy plants 90 geraniums. 

Then, we know that he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, the number of petunias is 90 - 40 = 50.

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias: 90 + 50 = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we need to add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year.

The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year. 

For the second year, they spend a third of that amount. To find a third of $15000, we can divide $15000 by 3.

$15000 ÷ 3 = $5000

So, the company spent $5000 on advertising for the second year.

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year:

$15000 + $5000 = $20000

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000.

"Let's count James' Pokémon cards. He has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. If he loses 8 of the water type and buys 14 grass type, we need to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type.

First, let's find the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type.

Initial total cards = 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90

After losing 8 water type cards: 
- Water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32
- Total cards = 90 - 8 = 82

After buying 14 grass type cards:
- Grass type cards = 20 + 14 = 34
- Total cards = 82 + 14 = 96

Now, we can calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100
= (32 / 96) * 100
= 33.333...%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33.

"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to add up the cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

First, we start with the base burrito, which costs $6.50. Then, Chad adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each. Since there are 2 sauces, we multiply $0.25 by 2, which is $0.50. Now, we add up the extra items: $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.

Now, we add the cost of the extra items to the base burrito: $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00. Chad also upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so we add that to the total: $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can put together in one minute. Kalinda can put 4 pieces together in one minute. Her mom can put half as many pieces together in one minute, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces.

So, together they can put 4 + 2 = 6 pieces together in one minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to put together 360 pieces. To do this, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can put together in one minute.

360 ÷ 6 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in one hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

"Let's figure out how many watermelons weren't ready to be picked after two weeks.

First, we need to find out how many watermelons were ready to be picked after two months. We know that 30% of the watermelons were ready, and there were 120 watermelons in total. To find 30% of 120, we multiply 120 by 0.3.

120 × 0.3 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready to be picked after two months. That means there were 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons left.

Now, we need to find out how many of those 84 watermelons were ready to be picked after two weeks. We know that 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready. To find 3/4 of 84, we multiply 84 by 3/4.

84 × 3/4 = 84 × 0.75 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready to be picked after two weeks. To find out how many weren't ready, we subtract 63 from 84.

"Let's figure out how much Mark paid for the cars.

First, we need to find the total cost of the cars. Mark bought 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of cars by the cost of each car.

12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000

Next, we need to find out how much tax Mark paid. He paid 10% tax on the cars. To find 10% of $240,000, we multiply $240,000 by 0.1.

0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000

Now, we need to find out how much Mark paid for registration. He paid $1000 for each car, and there are 12 cars. To find the total registration cost, we multiply the number of cars by the registration cost.

12 cars * $1000 per car = $12,000

Finally, we add up the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

$240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000

"So, Steve wants to grow cherry tomatoes and he eats a lot of them. He eats 6 tomatoes every day. His girlfriend eats half as many as him, so she eats 3 tomatoes a day. 

To find out how many tomatoes they eat in a week, we multiply the number of tomatoes they eat per day by 7. 

Steve eats 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week
His girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

So, together they eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Each vine can grow 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine: 
63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We start with 1000 students in the school hall. 

First, 30% of the students went out through exit A. To find 30% of 1000, we multiply 0.3 by 1000. 

0.3 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.

Now, we need to find out how many students are left. We subtract the number of students who went out through exit A from the total number of students.

1000 - 300 = 700 students are left.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. To find 3/5 of 700, we multiply 3/5 by 700.

(3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.

Now, we need to find out how many students are left. We subtract the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mike has 5 pen pals, but he stopped being friends with 2 of them. That means he has 3 pen pals left. Each of them sends him 2 letters a week, and Mike writes back to them. So, he gets 2 letters from each of the 3 friends, which is 2 x 3 = 6 letters. Since each letter is 5 pages long, he gets 6 x 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike writes back to each of his friends, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 x 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write 1 page every 6 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes he spends writing a week. To do this, we multiply the total number of pages by the time it takes to write one page: 60 x 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 ÷ 60 = 6 hours.

"Let's figure out how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan.

First, we need to find out how many minutes Jason uses for his daily calls. He talks to his boss for 15 minutes every day, and there are 30 days in the month. To find the total minutes used for daily calls, we multiply the number of minutes per day by the number of days:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Jason also had 300 extra minutes of calls this month. To find the total minutes used, we add the minutes used for daily calls and the extra minutes:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we need to subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in Jason's phone plan:

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left on his phone plan.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Griffin had 24 french fries. Then Kyle took 5 of them. So, Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.

Next, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Billy took 2 x 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Let's say Ginger gave Griffin x fries. After that, Griffin had 9 + x fries. Then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

To solve the equation 7 + x = 27, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation:

7 + x = 27
x = 27 - 7
x = 20

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

We have two aquariums with snails and fish. One aquarium has 4 snails and the other has 32 snails. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

The problem says that this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, let's call the number of fish in each aquarium ""x"". So, the total number of fish is 2x.

We can write an equation to represent the situation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the 2 that's being multiplied by 2x. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

28 ÷ 2 = 2x ÷ 2

This simplifies to:

14 = 2x

Now, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

14 ÷ 2 = x

x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"So, let's figure out how much Jean paid for the makeup. 

First, we need to find out how much she paid each day. The makeup artist charges $250 an hour, and it takes 6 hours each day. So, we multiply 250 by 6 to get the cost for each day.

$250 * 6 = $1500

Since Jean needs the makeup done 4 times a week, we multiply the cost for each day by 4.

$1500 * 4 = $6000

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so we multiply the cost for each week by 5.

$6000 * 5 = $30,000

After the movie is done, Jean gets a 10% discount. To find the discount, we multiply $30,000 by 0.1 (which is the same as 10%).

$30,000 * 0.1 = $3000

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid.

$30,000 - $3000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid for the party supplies, we need to add up the cost of everything. 

The cost of the cake is $12, the presents are $43, the decorations are $15, the invitations are $4, and the goodie bags are $22. 

First, we add these numbers together: $12 + $43 = $55
Then, we add $15 to that: $55 + $15 = $70
Next, we add $4 to that: $70 + $4 = $74
Finally, we add $22 to that: $74 + $22 = $96

Now that we know the total cost is $96, we need to divide it by 3 since Isabelle and her two parents are splitting the cost evenly. 

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find out how much the chef spent on onions, we need to know how many pounds of onions he bought and how much each pound costs.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag to find the total weight of onions.

Total weight = 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag
Total weight = 200 pounds

Now, we need to know the cost of each pound of onions. The problem says it costs $1.50 per pound.

To find the total cost, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound.

Total cost = Total weight * Cost per pound
Total cost = 200 pounds * $1.50/pound
Total cost = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's figure out how many more calories Sue ate than her sister.

We know that Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

To find out how many cookies Sue ate in total, we add the cookies she ate on Monday and Tuesday: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, so she ate a total of 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we multiply the total number of cookies Sue ate by 200 to find out how many calories she consumed: 46 x 200 = 9200 calories.

We do the same for her sister: 18 x 200 = 3600 calories.

Now, we subtract the calories her sister ate from the calories Sue ate to find out how many more calories Sue ate: 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

The final answer is: 5600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes. So, the total number of students in the school is 20 * 3 = 60.

The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, which means half of the students are boys and half are girls. So, the total number of boys in the school is 60 / 2 = 30.

We are given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. Let's find the total number of girls in the first two classes: 15 + 12 = 27.

Since the total number of girls in the school is 50%, we can find the number of girls in the third class by subtracting the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls: 30 - 27 = 3.

Now, we know that the third class has 3 girls. Since each class has 20 students, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"Let's figure out how many apps Travis has on his tablet now.

Travis started with 61 apps. He deleted 9 apps, so we need to subtract 9 from 61. 

61 - 9 = 52

Then, he downloaded 18 more apps. To find the total number of apps now, we add 18 to 52.

52 + 18 = 70

So, Travis has 70 apps on his tablet now."
"Let's figure out how many animals Rick killed.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than the previous night.

Let's say the number of cougars Rick killed today is x. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of wolves killed is 10 (last night) + 36 (today) = 46.
The total number of cougars killed is 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the number of wolves and cougars together: 46 + 27 = 73.

The final answer is: 73"
"To find out which floor Bill is on, we need to do some math. We know he starts on the 3rd floor. Then, he rides the elevator up to a floor that's 4 times his starting floor plus 6.

First, we multiply 3 (his starting floor) by 4. That's 3 × 4 = 12. 

Next, we add 6 to 12. That's 12 + 6 = 18.

So, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"Let's figure out how many times Robert went down the water slide.

First, we need to find out how many times Anne went down the slide. We know that Mitchel went down 30 times. To find out how many times Anne went down, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 x 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. We know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. To find out how many times Robert went down, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4.

21 x 4 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows. He wants to put an equal number of cows in each of the 10 stalls. To find out how many cows he will put in each stall, we need to divide the total number of cows by the number of stalls.

40 cows ÷ 10 stalls = 4 cows per stall

Now, we know that each stall already had 20 cows. So, if Mr. Sylas puts 4 more cows in each stall, we need to add 4 to 20.

20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows per stall

Now, we want to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. To do this, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

24 cows per stall × 8 stalls = 24 × 8
= 192

The final answer is: 192"
"Let's count the money in Brady's piggy bank. We need to find the total amount of money he has.

First, let's count the pennies. There are 100 pennies, and each penny is worth $0.01. So, we multiply 100 by $0.01 to get the total value of the pennies: 100 x $0.01 = $1.

Next, let's count the nickels. There are 40 nickels, and each nickel is worth $0.05. So, we multiply 40 by $0.05 to get the total value of the nickels: 40 x $0.05 = $2.

Now, let's count the dimes. There are 20 dimes, and each dime is worth $0.10. So, we multiply 20 by $0.10 to get the total value of the dimes: 20 x $0.10 = $2.

Finally, let's count the dollar bills. There are 40 dollar bills, and each dollar bill is worth $1. So, we multiply 40 by $1 to get the total value of the dollar bills: 40 x $1 = $40.

Now, let's add up the values of all the money: $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to know how many 10-foot sections it has. Since the redwood is 200 feet tall, we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 ÷ 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 × 400 = 8000 pounds.

But termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight. To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 8000 × 0.3 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000: 8000 - 2400 = 5600.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find out how much Nancy has to pay, we need to add up the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

First, we need to find the cost of the overdue books. Nancy has 8 books that are overdue, and each one costs $0.50. So, we multiply 8 by $0.50 to get the total cost of the books.

8 x $0.50 = $4.00

Now, we need to add the flat fee of $2.00 to the cost of the books. This is like adding 2 dollars to 4 dollars.

$4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

So, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"Let's figure out how many fruits there are in total.

We know that Andrea has 52 apples. Since she has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can find out how many apples Jamal has by subtracting 8 from 52. That's 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Now, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which means she has 48 ÷ 2 = 24 bananas.

To find the total number of fruits, we need to add up all the fruits. We have 52 apples from Andrea, 44 apples from Jamal, 24 bananas from Andrea, and 48 bananas from Jamal. So, the total number of fruits is 52 + 44 + 24 + 48 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to know how many cookies she's making and how many cups of flour are needed for each cookie.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so she's making a total of 36 + 30 = 66 cookies.

We know that 1 dozen (12) cookies need 2 cups of flour. To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs for 66 cookies, we can divide 66 by 12 to find out how many dozens of cookies she's making: 66 ÷ 12 = 5.5.

Since 5.5 is the same as 5 and a half dozen, we need to find out how many cups of flour are needed for the whole dozen and the half dozen. We need 2 cups for a dozen, and half of 2 cups is 1 cup. So, for 5.5 dozen cookies, we need 5 * 2 + 1 = 11 cups of flour.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first find two thirds of 9,300. 

We can do this by multiplying 9,300 by 2 and then dividing by 3.

(2 * 9,300) / 3 = 18,600 / 3 = 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.

So, the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62."
"Let's figure out how many marbles Maddison has now. 

First, we need to find out how many marbles she already has. She has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. To find the total number of marbles, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box: 5 x 50 = 250 marbles.

Then, Maddison gets 20 marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles she has now, we add the marbles she already had to the marbles she got from her friend: 250 + 20 = 270 marbles.

The final answer is: 270"
"Let's figure out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard.

We know Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. To find half of 6, we divide 6 by 2, which is 6 ÷ 2 = 3. So, Ferdinand has 3 trees.

Now, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 × 3 = 6. 5 more than that is 6 + 5 = 11. So, Harry has 11 trees.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much money all three girls have combined, we need to add up their individual amounts.

"Let's figure out how much more the house costs than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

First, we need to find the total price of the house. The house costs $350,000. We also have to pay a brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price. To find 5% of $350,000, we multiply 0.05 by $350,000. This is the same as multiplying 5 by $350,000 and then dividing by 100. So, 5 * $350,000 = $1,750,000, and then we divide by 100, which is the same as moving the decimal point two places to the left. So, $1,750,000 ÷ 100 = $17,500.

Next, we have to pay a transfer fee, which is 12% of the selling price. To find 12% of $350,000, we multiply 0.12 by $350,000. This is the same as multiplying 12 by $350,000 and then dividing by 100. So, 12 * $350,000 = $4,200,000, and then we divide by 100, which is the same as moving the decimal point two places to the left. So, $4,200,000 ÷ 100 = $42,000.

Now, we add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee to find the total price of the house. $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the house costs than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price. $409,500 - $400,000 = $4,500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000. He had to pay some fees and a loan. We need to find out how much money he has left after paying all these costs.

First, let's find out how much he paid for the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price. To find 3% of a number, we multiply it by 0.03. So, 3% of $400,000 is 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, we need to find out how much he paid for the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. To find 5% of a number, we multiply it by 0.05. So, 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000.

Now, we add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees. $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

The total fees are $32,000, so we subtract this from the selling price to find the net selling price. $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, Mr. Tan still had to pay $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find his net proceeds, we subtract the loan amount from the net selling price. $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To find the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees, we need to figure out 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 x 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 20 (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 (to cook) = 71 minutes.

The final answer is: 71"

"So, let's figure out how many blue golf balls the juggler has. We know the juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of those balls are golf balls. 

To find the number of golf balls, we need to divide the total number of balls by 2.

16 ÷ 2 = 8

So, there are 8 golf balls. Now, we need to find out how many of those golf balls are blue. Since half of the golf balls are blue, we need to divide the number of golf balls by 2.

8 ÷ 2 = 4

So, there are 4 blue golf balls."
"Let's figure out how many M&Ms Mary got in total.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms. That's a lot of candy!

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag. To find out how many M&Ms are in the second bag, we need to add 12 to 300. That's 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

Now, let's talk about the third bag. It has a hole in it, so it only has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag. To find out how many M&Ms are in the third bag, we need to divide 300 by 2. That's 300 ÷ 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add up the number of M&Ms in each bag: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

So, Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms.

The final answer is: 762"
"Let's count the windows in John's houses. 

First, we need to find out how many windows are in the bedrooms. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, we multiply 3 (number of bedrooms) by 2 (number of windows in each bedroom) to get 6 windows in each house. Since there are 2 houses, we multiply 6 by 2 to get 12 windows in the bedrooms.

Now, let's count the extra windows in each house. There are 4 extra windows in each house. Since there are 2 houses, we multiply 4 by 2 to get 8 extra windows.

To find the total number of windows, we add the windows in the bedrooms and the extra windows. So, 12 (windows in the bedrooms) + 8 (extra windows) = 20 windows.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the change, we need to add up the cost of the things the mom bought. 

The cost of the cocoa is $4.20, the laundry is $9.45, and the pasta is $1.35. 

First, we add the cost of the cocoa and the laundry: $4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65

Then, we add the cost of the pasta to that: $13.65 + $1.35 = $14.00

Now, we know the total cost is $14.00. The mom paid $20, so to find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid: $20 - $14.00 = $6.00

The final answer is: $6.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, and the collar takes a tenth of that number. To find the number of stitches for the collar, we need to divide 900 by 10.

900 ÷ 10 = 90

So, the collar takes 90 stitches. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 x 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we need to find the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette. We add the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette together.

90 + 180 = 270

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 270. Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, and the body takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we need to divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find the number of stitches for each sleeve.

630 ÷ 2 = 315

The final answer is: 315"
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds, we need to add up the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds.

First, let's find the cost of the tomato seeds. We know she bought 20 packets of tomato seeds, and each packet costs $40. So, we multiply 20 by 40 to get the total cost of the tomato seeds: 20 × $40 = $800.

Next, we need to find the cost of the celery seeds. Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds, and each packet costs $30. So, we multiply 80 by 30 to get the total cost of the celery seeds: 80 × $30 = $2400.

Now, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds together to get the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds: $800 + $2400 = $3200.

"So, Sean has to memorize lines for a play. He has to learn the lyrics to a song, which has 54 lines. That's the easy part.

The first scene has twice as many lines as the song, so it has 2 x 54 = 108 lines. But Sean only has to learn a third of those lines, so he has to learn 108 ÷ 3 = 36 lines.

The second scene has 6 more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Sean has to learn 4 out of 5 of those lines, so he has to learn (4/5) x 60 = 48 lines.

To find out how many lines Sean has to learn in total, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Carly has 80 cards. We need to find out how many cards have the letter D on them.

First, we find out how many cards have the letter A on them. 2/5 of the cards have the letter A, so we multiply 80 by 2/5:

(2/5) × 80 = (2 × 80) / 5
= 160 / 5
= 32

So, 32 cards have the letter A on them.

Now, we need to find out how many cards are left after we take out the ones with the letter A. We subtract 32 from 80:

80 - 32 = 48

Next, we find out how many cards have the letter B on them. 1/2 of the remaining cards have the letter B, so we multiply 48 by 1/2:

(1/2) × 48 = (1 × 48) / 2
= 48 / 2
= 24

So, 24 cards have the letter B on them.

Now, we need to find out how many cards are left after we take out the ones with the letters A and B. We subtract 24 from 48:

48 - 24 = 24

Next, we find out how many cards have the letter C on them. 5/8 of the remaining cards have the letter C, so we multiply 24 by 5/8:

(5/8) × 24 = (5 × 24) / 8
= 120 / 8
= 15

So, 15 cards have the letter C on them.

Now, we need to find out how many cards have the letter D on them. We subtract the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards:

80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how long it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to add up the time it takes to dig the small holes and the large holes.

First, let's find the time it takes to dig the small holes. Matthew digs a small hole in 3 minutes. If he digs 30 small holes, we multiply 3 minutes by 30.

3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

Next, we find the time it takes to dig the large holes. Matthew digs a large hole in 10 minutes. If he digs 15 large holes, we multiply 10 minutes by 15.

10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to dig the small holes and the large holes together.

90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To make it easier to understand, we can convert the total minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 240 minutes by 60.

240 minutes ÷ 60 = 4 hours

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's figure out the problem. We know that Mico and Marco's ages add up to 20. If we want to find out how old they will be in 10 years, we need to add 10 to each of their ages.

Let's say Mico's age is M and Marco's age is m. We know that M + m = 20. To find their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 to both M and m. So, in 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be m + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (m + 10). We can simplify this by adding the numbers together: (M + m) + 10 + 10. Since we know that M + m = 20, we can substitute 20 into the equation: 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. If we let S be Sam's age, then Ruby's age is 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby will be 6S + 9 years old, and Sam will be S + 9 years old. We are told that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So we can write the equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

To solve for S, we need to get all the S terms on one side of the equation and the numbers on the other side. We can do this by subtracting 3S from both sides of the equation:

6S - 3S + 9 = 3S - 3S + 9
3S + 9 = 9

Next, we need to get the 9 by itself on the other side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 9 from both sides:

3S + 9 - 9 = 9 - 9
3S = 0

Now, we need to get S by itself. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:

3S / 3 = 0 / 3
S = 0

However, this doesn't make sense because we can't be 0 years old. Let's go back to the previous step and try again.

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

This time, let's expand the right side of the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Now, let's subtract 3S from both sides of the equation:

6S - 3S + 9 = 3S - 3S + 27
3S + 9 = 27

Next, let's subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:

3S + 9 - 9 = 27 - 9
3S = 18

Now, let's divide both sides of the equation by 3:

3S / 3 = 18 / 3
S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old."
"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to add up the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars.

First, let's find the cost of the popsicles. We know Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each. To find the total cost of the popsicles, we multiply the number of popsicles by the cost of each popsicle: 20 x $0.25 = $5.

Next, we need to find the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each. To find the total cost of the ice cream bars, we multiply the number of ice cream bars by the cost of each ice cream bar: 4 x $0.50 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars together: $5 + $2 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"Let's figure out the total number of spots on the snakes in the park.

First, we need to find out how many spots are on the cobras. There are 40 cobras and each cobra has 70 spots. To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Now, we need to find out how many spots are on the mambas. We know that the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras. So, we divide the number of spots per cobra by 2 to find the number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 60 mambas, so we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, we find half the total number of spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"Maddy is buying pizza for her cousin's soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 guests. A pizza will serve 3 people. If each pizza costs $15, how many dollars will Maddy spend?

First, we need to find out how many people Maddy needs to buy pizza for. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so that's 15 people. Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 x 2 = 24 guests. In total, Maddy needs to buy pizza for 15 + 24 = 39 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy. 39 ÷ 3 = 13 pizzas.

Now, we need to find out how much money Maddy will spend. Each pizza costs $15, so we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost of each pizza: 13 x $15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to figure out how much space the topaz gemstones take up and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them. So, the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 x 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. 

Now, we need to find out how much space is left for the silver beads. We do this by subtracting the length taken up by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we need to divide the remaining space by the length of each bead to find out how many beads there are. To do this, we can multiply the remaining space by 4 (since 1/4 is the same as 4/16 or 4 divided by 4) to make the division easier: 17 x 4 = 68. 

Now, we divide 68 by 4 to find the number of beads: 68 ÷ 4 = 17.

So, Katerina uses 17 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: 17"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many stories each person wrote in the first week. Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. To find the total number of stories they wrote in the first week, we add these numbers together.

20 + 40 + 60 = 120

Now, let's think about the second week. Each person doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. So, Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, we need to find the total number of stories they wrote in the second week. We add these numbers together.

40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the total number of stories from the first week and the second week.

120 + 240 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how old Ann's brother will be in 3 years, we need to know his current age. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can find his age by multiplying Ann's age by 2.

Ann's age is 9 years, so her brother's age is 9 x 2 = 18 years.

In 3 years, her brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

The final answer is: 21"
"Let's figure out how much money Kelly has left after buying a can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. We need to find the total amount of money she has. 

Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents. 
Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

To find the total amount Kelly has, we add the value of the quarters and dimes together: 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Now, Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how much money she has left, we need to subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

So, Kelly has 90 cents left."
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we need to know how many stars are in the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so we multiply 3 by 8 to find the total number of stars in these rows: 3 × 8 = 24.

There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so we multiply 2 by 6 to find the total number of stars in these rows: 2 × 6 = 12.

Now, we add the number of stars in the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows: 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, we subtract the number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from 76 to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows: 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each row has 5 stars, we divide the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows: 40 ÷ 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"So, we need to figure out how many trucks are needed to carry 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and the trucks can carry 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks we need, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of the trucks.

First, let's find the total weight of the flagstones. We multiply the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone:
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks:
6000 pounds ÷ 2000 pounds/truck = 3

So, we need 3 trucks to carry 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the time it took for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles, we need to know its speed. We know the car in the fast lane is going 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is going half that speed. 

So, the car in the slow lane is going 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour.

Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. We know the distance is 480 miles and the speed is 30 miles per hour.

time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Ali has 22 medals, and his friend Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali. So, Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Now, let's add the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together: 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem says that together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

Let's call the total number of medals given out ""x"". Then, we can write an equation:

10x = 39

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 ÷ 10
x = 3.9

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9.

The final answer is: 3.9"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are there in total. We know there are 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet has 5 chocolate bars. So, we multiply the number of packets by the number of chocolate bars in each packet: 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars.

Now, we know that each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. There are 4 adults, so we multiply the number of adults by the number of chocolate bars each adult gets: 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars.

To find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars.

Since there are 8 children, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get: 16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's figure out how much money Susan earns for her online task.

First, we need to know how long she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. But she takes a break for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can multiply 2.5 hours by 60 to find out how many minutes she works.

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes. We can do this by dividing 150 by 10.

150 minutes ÷ 10 minutes = 15

Susan earns $5 for every 10-minute interval. So, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's figure out how many points the three friends have in total after the extra points had been distributed.

First, we need to know how many points each friend has after the fourth round. We know that Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's see who gets an extra point in the fourth round. If you have more than 20 points, you get an extra point. Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 21 + 1 = 22 points. Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point and still has 18 points. Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three friends after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83

The final answer is: 83"
"Let's figure out how many oranges are left unwashed.

Will buys 15 oranges. His 2 sons are asked to wash as many oranges as they are years old. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

The oldest son washes 8 oranges because he is 8 years old. The youngest son washes 4 oranges because he is 4 years old.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges. So, we do 15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's figure out how many exercises Darren did in two days.

On the first day, Darren did 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. That's a total of 100 + 50 + 20 = 170 exercises.

On the second day, he did 20 more pushups than the first day, so that's 100 + 20 = 120 pushups. He did 10 fewer squats, so that's 50 - 10 = 40 squats. And he doubled the number of dumbbell presses, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

Now, let's add up the exercises for the second day: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200 exercises.

To find the total number of exercises in two days, we add the exercises from both days: 170 + 200 = 370 exercises.

The final answer is: 370"
"To find out how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to know how much rice is eaten each day. 

Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice for each meal, and there are 2 meals a day (lunch and dinner). So, each person eats 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 people in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice eaten per day is 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount eaten per day (2 kg).

42 kg ÷ 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the total number of days by 7.

21 days ÷ 7 days per week = 3 weeks

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's figure out how many crates Sam was off from his target.

Sam wants to sell 120 crates of bread in a week. But he was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any bread on those days. He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.

To find out how many crates he sold in total, we need to add up all the crates he sold. We can do this by adding 20 + 15 + 12 + 18.

20 + 15 = 35
35 + 12 = 47
47 + 18 = 65

So, Sam sold 65 crates in total.

Now, we need to find out how many crates he was off from his target. To do this, we subtract the total number of crates he sold from his target.

120 (target) - 65 (total sold) = 55

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target.

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to figure out how much money was bid in total. We know that the first bid was $200, and each time someone bids, the price goes up by $50.

There were 3 other people who bid before Carmen, and then Carmen bid after each of them. So, there were 3 bids from the other people, and then 3 bids from Carmen. That's a total of 6 bids.

We can think of this as a sequence of numbers: $200, $250, $300, $350, $400, $450. We can add these numbers together to find the total cost.

Let's add them up:

$200 + $250 = $450
$450 + $300 = $750
$750 + $350 = $1100
$1100 + $400 = $1500
$1500 + $450 = $1950

So, the total cost of the desk is $1950.

The final answer is: $1950"
"Let's figure out how much John pays for driving to work each year.

First, we need to find out how many miles John drives in a year. He drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home, so that's 60 miles per day. He goes to work 5 days a week, so he drives 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles per week. Since there are 50 weeks in a year, he drives 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Now, let's find out how much he pays for driving. He gets charged $2 per mile, so he pays 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, he pays $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

To find the total cost, we add the driving cost and the bonus: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 2 × 39 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To make a 32-page tabloid, you need to fold a piece of paper in half. When you fold it, the front and back sides become the left and right sides of the folded paper.

Imagine you have a big piece of paper with 32 pages. You can print the pages like this:

- Page 1 is on the left back.
- Page 2 is on the left front.
- Page 32 is on the right back.
- Page 31 is on the right front.

This keeps going until you reach the middle of the paper. Then, the pattern reverses.

Since each piece of paper can be folded in half, you need two pieces of paper for the first 16 pages (left and right sides) and another two pieces of paper for the last 16 pages (left and right sides).

So, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2 + 2 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's figure out how much money Annika has left.

Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks. To find half of $50, we need to divide 50 by 2. That's 50 ÷ 2 = $25.

She also spent $10 on rides.

So, the total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, we need to subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's figure out how much money Elise made from selling books in the second year.

We know that Elise has 250 books in total. She has 50 books left unsold, so she sold 250 - 50 = 200 books.

We also know that she sold 45 books this year. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did this year, she sold 2 x 45 = 90 books in the first year.

To find out how many books she sold in the second year, we subtract the books she sold in the first year and this year from the total number of books she sold: 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.

Since each book sells for $20, we multiply the number of books she sold in the second year by the price per book: 65 x $20 = $1300.

The final answer is: $1300"
"Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week. That's a total of 10 * 5 = 50 hours a week. He earns $10 per hour, so he makes 50 * $10 = $500 per week from his job. 

He also gets a $300 bonus every week if the company does well. So, his total weekly earnings are $500 + $300 = $800.

Since April has 4 weeks, Watson's total earnings for the month are $800 * 4 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"So, John arm wrestles 20 people. He beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he lost to, we need to find 20% of 20.

20% of 20 is the same as 0.2 x 20. We multiply 0.2 by 20 to get the answer.

0.2 x 20 = 4

So, John lost to 4 people."
"Let's figure out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

The bakery makes 60 loaves of bread every day. In the morning, they sell 2/3 of the loaves. To find 2/3 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and then divide by 3.

60 × 2 = 120
120 ÷ 3 = 40

So, they sell 40 loaves in the morning. Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left. We subtract the morning sales from the total number of loaves.

60 - 40 = 20

Now, we know that half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. To find half of 20, we multiply 20 by 1/2.

20 × 1/2 = 10

So, 10 loaves are sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 2 pounds.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the savings on the tubs of ice cream. The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

Next, let's find the savings on the packets of milk. The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. 
The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"So, Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum makes you grow extra arms and legs. You grow an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days. We need to find out how many new limbs you'll have after 15 days.

Let's start with the arms. If you grow an extra arm every 3 days, how many arms will you grow in 15 days? To find this out, we can divide 15 by 3. That's 15 ÷ 3 = 5. So, you'll grow 5 extra arms.

Now, let's look at the legs. If you grow an extra leg every 5 days, how many legs will you grow in 15 days? To find this out, we can divide 15 by 5. That's 15 ÷ 5 = 3. So, you'll grow 3 extra legs.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the extra arms and legs together. That's 5 + 3 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Theo has $6000 to spend on his trip to South Africa. He wants to save $2000, so he has to spend the rest on business suits, suitcases, a flight ticket, and gifts.

First, let's find out how much he spent on business suits. He bought 6 suits at $100 each, so the total cost of suits is:

6 x $100 = $600

Next, he bought 3 suitcases at $50 each, so the total cost of suitcases is:

3 x $50 = $150

Now, let's find out how much the flight ticket costs. It's $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times this amount is:

5 x $100 = $500

The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the cost of the flight ticket is:

$500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up the cost of suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:

$600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

This is how much he spent so far. To find out how much he has left, we subtract this amount from his initial budget:

$6000 - $1950 = $4050

Since he wants to save $2000, he has to spend the remaining amount on gifts. To find this amount, we subtract the amount he wants to save from the remaining budget:

$4050 - $2000 = $2050

So, he has $2050 left to spend on gifts.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To find out how many eggs the family will eat in a week, we need to first figure out how many eggs they eat in a day. 

There are 3 people who eat 3 eggs each day, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 eggs. 

The rest of the family has 5 - 3 = 2 people, and they eat 2 eggs each day, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, we add the eggs eaten by both groups: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs eaten per day by 7: 13 x 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"Let's figure out Trent's age. We know that Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. To find Jane's age, we need to subtract 3 from Quinn's age. 

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age. Trent is 5 years older than Jane. To find Trent's age, we need to add 5 to Jane's age.

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how old Noah was 6 years ago. Since Cera is 46 years old now, 6 years ago she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. Since Noah was half as old as Cera 6 years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

Now, we know that the population of Chile 6 years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, the population of Chile 6 years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

We also know that the population of Chile 6 years ago was half of what it is now. So, the current population of Chile is 2 * 60,000 = 120,000.

The final answer is: 120,000"
"Let's solve the problem together. We have a football team with 105 members. The team is divided into three groups: offense, defense, and special teams.

Let's say the number of players on the defense is D. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, so they have D/2 players.

To find the total number of players, we add the number of players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2.

We know the total number of players is 105, so we can write an equation:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Now, let's combine the like terms:

7D = 210

To find D, we need to divide both sides by 7:

D = 210 ÷ 7
D = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's figure out how many people will show up to Martha's party.

First, we need to find out how many people Martha invited. She invited 2 families with 6 people in each family, and 3 families with 4 people in each family.

2 families with 6 people: 2 x 6 = 12 people
3 families with 4 people: 3 x 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

Now, 8 people couldn't come to the party because they're sick. We need to subtract those people from the total number of people invited.
24 - 8 = 16 people

But, 1/4 of the people who were sick had previous commitments, which means 1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments. To find 1/4 of 8, we divide 8 by 4.
8 ÷ 4 = 2 people

So, 2 people had previous commitments and couldn't come to the party. We need to subtract those people from the number of people who weren't sick.
16 - 2 = 14 people

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many marbles Solomon has in the store. He bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna and added them to a store that already had 50 marbles. So, we add 20 and 50 together: 20 + 50 = 70.

Then, his dad gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. To find 2/5 of 20, we multiply 20 by 2 and then divide by 5: (2/5) * 20 = (2 * 20) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8. So, his dad gave him 8 marbles.

Now, we add the marbles his dad gave him to the marbles he already had: 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to know its volume. The pool is a rectangular prism, so we multiply its length, width, and height to get the volume.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Cost per cubic foot = $0.1
Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's figure out how many kids are in the classroom. We know there are 30 boys. The classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, so we multiply 30 by 3 to find the number of girls:
Girls = 3 × 30 = 90

We also know that there are 1/10 as many nongendered kids as boys. To find this number, we multiply 30 by 1/10:
Nongendered kids = 1/10 × 30 = 3

Now, we add up the number of boys, girls, and nongendered kids to find the total number of kids in the classroom:
Total kids = Boys + Girls + Nongendered kids = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the number of electric poles needed, we need to use the ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. We know that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 ÷ 3
x = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many people left the party. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find 1/4 of 40, we can multiply 40 by 1/4. 

40 × 1/4 = 40 × 0.25 = 10

So, 10 people left the party. Since 22 men stayed, that means 25 - 22 = 3 men left. 

If 10 people left and 3 of them were men, then 10 - 3 = 7 women left. 

Now, we know that 15 women were at the party initially, and 7 left. To find out how many women are left, we subtract 7 from 15.

15 - 7 = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to know the cost of the magazine first. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, we can find the cost of the magazine by dividing the cost of the book by 2.

The cost of the magazine = $4 ÷ 2 = $2

Now, we know the magazine costs $2. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so we subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine to find the cost of the pen.

The cost of the pen = $2 - $1 = $1

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we know that Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can write an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 x 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to figure out how much the ice cubes and the cream weaken it.

First, let's think about the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. We want to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. So, we need to find out how many ice cubes it takes to cool it down that much.

Let's say the coffee starts at 100 degrees. We want to cool it down to 35 degrees. That's a 65-degree drop. If each ice cube cools it by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find out how many ice cubes we need. 

65 ÷ 13 = 5

So, we need 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since we need 5 ice cubes, the coffee becomes 5 x 12 = 60 milliliters weaker because of the ice cubes.

Next, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream. This also makes the coffee weaker. So, we add 15 milliliters to the 60 milliliters we already calculated.

60 + 15 = 75

The coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that 5 people came to the record store and left with 7 new records. We also know that for every 2 old records, you get 1 new record. 

To find out how many old records they brought in, we need to figure out how many old records were traded for the 7 new records. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, we can multiply the number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records traded.

2 old records = 1 new record
7 new records * 2 old records/new record = 14 old records

So, the total number of old records traded is 14. Since there are 5 people, we can divide the total number of old records by 5 to find out how many old records each person brought in.

14 old records ÷ 5 people = 2.8 old records per person

Since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we can round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we are looking for the total number of old records, so we can multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people.

However, we can simplify the problem by realizing that the 2.8 old records per person is not necessary to solve the problem. We can just multiply the number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are 100 people working at the company. We also know that 2/5 of the employees are junior programmers. To find out how many junior programmers there are, we need to multiply 2/5 by 100.

2/5 × 100 = 40

So, there are 40 junior programmers. That means there are 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. To find out how much the company pays to all the junior programmers, we multiply the number of junior programmers by their salary.

40 × $2000 = $80,000

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their salary is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

To find out how much the company pays to all the senior programmers, we multiply the number of senior programmers by their salary.

60 × $2400 = $144,000

Now, we add the money paid to junior programmers and senior programmers to find the total amount paid to all programmers.

$80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

The final answer is: $224,000"
"Let's solve this problem step by step. 

We know that at the third bus stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Before that, 8 people got on the bus at the second stop. So, at the second stop, there were 20 - 8 = 12 people on the bus.

At the second stop, 7 people got off the bus, so before that, there were 12 + 7 = 19 people on the bus.

Now, we need to find out how many people were on the bus before the first stop. At the first stop, 5 people got on the bus. So, before the first stop, there were 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus.

The question asks how many people got on the bus at the terminal. So, the answer is 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's figure out how many lollipops Oscar has left.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

Then, he passes 14 out to his friends. To find out how many lollipops he has left, we subtract 14 from 22: 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

Next, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave away 14, he buys 2 x 14 = 28 more lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

After that, he eats 3 more lollipops that night. To find out how many he has left, we subtract 3 from 36: 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning. To find out how many he has left, we subtract 2 from 33: 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is: 31"
"So, let's figure out how long it will take to fully charge the phone. The phone charges 1 percentage point every 3 minutes. If it's already at 60% charged, we need to find out how long it will take to get to 100%.

To do that, we need to find out how many percentage points are left to charge. We subtract the current charge from 100%: 100% - 60% = 40%. So, we need 40 more percentage points to fully charge the phone.

Since the phone charges 1 percentage point every 3 minutes, we multiply 40 by 3 to find out how many minutes it will take to charge 40 percentage points: 40 * 3 = 120 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 hours.

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's solve this problem step by step. Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mom gives her 10 more, so we add 7 + 10 to find the new total. 

7 + 10 = 17

Now, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to subtract 3 from 17.

17 - 3 = 14

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's figure out how much the customer paid on their shopping trip.

First, we need to find out how many rewards the customer got from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 they spend, they get a reward. So, we divide $80 by $20 to find out how many rewards they got.

$80 ÷ $20 = 4 rewards

Now, we know they got 4 rewards. On their current shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they got $4 off the price.

The coupon they used took twice the amount of rewards off the price. That means it took 2 x $4 = $8 off the price.

So, the total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

To find out how much they paid, we subtract the discount from the amount they spent: $43 - $12 = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"Let's figure out which job pays more money. We need to find out how much money Nick will take home from each job.

Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year. To find the total income, we multiply the hourly wage by the number of hours worked:

$15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year

Now, we need to subtract the income tax. The state has a 20% tax rate, so we multiply the total income by 0.20:

$30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000

Now, we subtract the income tax from the total income:

$30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B pays $42,000 a year, but we need to subtract the property tax first. The property tax is $6,000, so we subtract that from the total income:

$42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000

Next, we need to subtract the income tax. The state has a 10% tax rate, so we multiply the net income by 0.10:

$36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600

Now, we subtract the income tax from the net income:

$36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we need to find out which job pays more. We subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of ruined castles in Scotland, we need to calculate 40% of 220. 

40% of 220 = 0.4 × 220 = 88

Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we need to divide the number of ruined castles by 2.

88 ÷ 2 = 44

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"
"Let's figure out the cost difference between the two offers. 

First, we need to find the total cost of each offer. 

Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. To find the total cost, we need to add the advance payment and the total of the monthly installments. The total of the monthly installments is 6 * $350 = $2,100. So, the total cost of Furniture United's offer is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. To find the total cost, we need to add the advance payment and the total of the monthly installments. The total of the monthly installments is 9 * $250 = $2,250. So, the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

Now, we need to find the cost difference between the two offers. To do this, we subtract the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer from the total cost of Furniture United's offer: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To find out how many paintball guns each person would have if they were shared equally, we need to add up the total number of guns and then divide by the number of people.

First, let's count the total number of guns: DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. 

8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

Now, we need to divide the total number of guns by the number of people. There are 4 people.

24 ÷ 4 = 6

So, if they were to share their guns equally, each person would have 6 paintball guns.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the amount of sugar for 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

First, let's find out how much sugar Mason needs for 8 batches of suckers. We multiply the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of suckers (30 ounces) by 8. This is 8 x 30 = 240 ounces.

Next, we need to find out how much sugar Mason needs for 1 batch of fudge. This is 70 ounces.

Now, we add the amount of sugar needed for the suckers (240 ounces) and the fudge (70 ounces) to get the total amount of sugar Mason needs. This is 240 + 70 = 310 ounces.

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

The final answer is: 310"
"Let's figure out the final value of Maria's shares.

First, we need to find out how much the price of each share goes up and down. 

The price of each share starts at $8. It goes up by 50% in the first year. To find 50% of $8, we multiply $8 by 0.5. That's $4. So, the price of each share after the first year is $8 + $4 = $12.

Now, the price of each share goes down by 25% in the second year. To find 25% of $12, we multiply $12 by 0.25. That's $3. So, the price of each share after the second year is $12 - $3 = $9.

Maria has 8 shares. To find the total value of all her shares, we multiply the price of each share after the second year by the number of shares. That's $9 * 8 = $72.

The final value of all Maria's shares is $72."
"Let's figure out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke.

First, we need to find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we multiply 2 by 3 to find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. 2 × 3 = 6.

Now, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so we divide 6 by 2 to find out how many hot dogs John ate. 6 ÷ 2 = 3.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we need to subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate. 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's solve the problem. We have 200 students in a class, and they are divided into 3 groups. Two of the groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups.

Let's say the number of students in each of the two equal groups is x. Then, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can write an equation to represent this:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Since the smallest group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x: 
70 - 10 = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Farmer Brown has 60 animals on his farm, and they are either chickens or cows. We also know that he has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's call the number of cows ""C"" and the number of chickens ""H"". Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, we can write an equation: H = 2C.

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write another equation: H + C = 60.

Now, we can substitute H in the second equation with 2C, resulting in 2C + C = 60. This simplifies to 3C = 60.

To find the value of C, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in C = 20.

Since H = 2C, we can find the value of H by multiplying C by 2, resulting in H = 40.

Now, let's think about the number of legs each animal has. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. We can find the total number of legs of the chickens by multiplying the number of chickens by 2, which is 40 * 2 = 80. We can find the total number of legs of the cows by multiplying the number of cows by 4, which is 20 * 4 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"Josh starts juggling with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, he has 3 + 4 = 7 balls.

When he drops 3 balls, 2 are caught, so 1 ball is lost. 

So, Josh starts juggling with 7 balls and loses 1, leaving him with 7 - 1 = 6 balls.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's figure out the total weight of the animals and the container.

We know that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. Since the blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, it also weighs 50 pounds. The green toad also weighs the same as the pink frog, so it's also 50 pounds.

Now, let's think about the yellow snake. It weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog. So, we add 10 pounds to 50 pounds to get the weight of the yellow snake: 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

Next, we have the red bird. It weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog. To find its weight, we subtract 20 pounds from 50 pounds: 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals. Let's add them up: 50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) = 240 pounds.

We also have a container that weighs 20 pounds. To find the total weight, we add the weight of the container to the weight of the animals: 240 pounds + 20 pounds = 260 pounds.

The final answer is: 260"
"So, let's figure out how many baby outfits Laurel has. She got 24 outfits from her friend. Then, she got twice as many outfits at the baby shower, which is 2 x 24 = 48 outfits. That's a lot of outfits! Finally, her mom gave her 15 more outfits.

To find the total number of outfits, we just add them all together: 24 + 48 + 15 = 87.

The final answer is: 87"
"So, Tyson is a runner and he runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 more meters in a day. To find out how many more meters that is, we need to multiply 5000 by 1/5.

1/5 of 5000 is 5000 ÷ 5 = 1000 meters. 

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, we need to multiply 6000 by 30 to find the total distance covered in June.

6000 × 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180000"
"Let's figure out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B.

First, we need to find out how much Juice Box B costs. We know that Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, and Juice Box A costs 4 dollars. So, we add 5 dollars to 4 dollars to find the price of Juice Box B.

4 + 5 = 9

Now, we need to find out how much Juice Box C costs. We know that Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, and Juice Box A costs 4 dollars. So, we add 7 dollars to 4 dollars to find the price of Juice Box C.

4 + 7 = 11

Now, we need to find the difference between the price of Juice Box C and Juice Box B. To do this, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C.

11 - 9 = 2

So, Juice Box C is 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's count the legs of the tables in the restaurant. We have two kinds of tables: some have 4 legs and some have 3 legs.

We have 40 tables with 4 legs. To find the total number of legs for these tables, we multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table: 40 * 4 = 160 legs.

We also have 50 tables with 3 legs. To find the total number of legs for these tables, we multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table: 50 * 3 = 150 legs.

Now, we add the number of legs from both types of tables: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs.

The final answer is: 310"
"Let's figure out how many cookies Jenny eats.

Jenny buys a bag of cookies that has 36 cookies. Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 x 5 = 20 cookies a week.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 x 7 = 7 cookies a week.

To find out how many cookies are left, we need to add the cookies eaten by her son and husband. 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Now, we need to subtract the cookies eaten by her son and husband from the total number of cookies in the bag. 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts, we need to first find the discount amount. The discount is 40% of $30.

40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price of one shirt.

Discounted price of one shirt = $30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2 to get the total cost.

Total cost = $18 * 2 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage more they're making per day now, we need to know how much more money they're making and then figure out what percentage that is of the original amount.

First, let's find out how much more money they're making per day. They used to sell 10 tractors a day for $100 each, so that's 10 x $100 = $1000 per day. Now, they sell 5 silos a day for $220 each, so that's 5 x $220 = $1100 per day.

The difference is $1100 - $1000 = $100 more per day.

Now, to find the percentage, we need to divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100. So, ($100 / $1000) x 100 = 10%.

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now."
"To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to know how much she spends per month and multiply it by 12.

First, let's figure out how much she spends on food per month. We know that food costs $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, we multiply the cost of food per week by the number of weeks in a month:

$25/week × 4 weeks/month = $100/month

Now, let's add the cost of treats and medicine to the food cost. Treats cost $20 per month, and medicine costs $100 per month. So, the total cost per month is:

$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220/month

To find the total cost per year, we multiply the total cost per month by 12:

$220/month × 12 months/year = $2,640/year

The final answer is: $2640"

- Wednesday's cheese-tasting event: 0.5 hours (half of 1 hour)
- Thursday's museum tour: half as long as the cooking class, so 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
- Friday's errands: 2 hours

Now, let's add up the time for all activities:

"So, April is getting plant pots for a school garden. They need 30 pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. That's 2 x 30 = 60 pots for the roses. 

To find out how many pots they need in total, we add the number of pots for the daisies and the roses: 30 + 60 = 90 pots.

April already bought 100 pots, so we need to subtract the total number of pots they need from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to know how much money she had at the beginning and how much she had left after buying the sweater and giving her brother money.

Andrea started with $36. She spent $11 on a sweater, so she had $36 - $11 = $25 left. Then, she gave her brother $4, so she had $25 - $4 = $21 left.

To find out how much she saved, we need to subtract the amount she had left from the amount she started with. 

Initial amount: $36
Amount after saving: $21

Amount saved = Initial amount - Amount after saving
Amount saved = $36 - $21
Amount saved = $15

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much time John spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows. We know he spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the time he spent on these activities: 6 hours (boating) + 3 hours (swimming) + 6 hours (watching shows) = 15 hours.

We know that the time he spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. If 30% of the total time is 6 hours, we can find the total time by dividing 6 by 0.30 (which is the same as 30% written as a decimal). 

6 ÷ 0.30 = 20 hours

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time he spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time. To find 40% of 20 hours, we multiply 20 by 0.40 (which is the same as 40% written as a decimal).

20 * 0.40 = 8 hours

So, John spent 8 hours sightseeing.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's figure out how much money Annabelle still needs to save for her phone.

First, we need to know how much money she already has. Annabelle has $80 in her savings.

Next, we need to find out how much money she earns from her two jobs. At her first job, she earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours. To find out how much she earns, we multiply the number of hours she works by her hourly wage:

$10/hour * 20 hours = $200

At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours. To find out how much she earns, we multiply the number of hours she works by her hourly wage:

$5/hour * 15 hours = $75

Now, we add the money she earns from both jobs to find her total earnings:

$200 + $75 = $275

Since Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, we need to subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone to find out how much more she needs to save:

$400 - $275 = $125

So, Annabelle still needs to save $125 to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $125"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the combined height of the two shorter trees. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so it's 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

Now, we add the heights of the two shorter trees together: 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The tallest tree is twice as tall as the two shorter trees combined, so we multiply 17 by 2: 2 × 17 = 34 feet.

The tallest tree is 34 feet tall.

The final answer is: 34"
"Let's figure out how much money Dean has left.

First, we need to find out how much Dean spent on toy cars and teddy bears. He bought 6 toy cars for $2 each, so that's 6 x $2 = $12. Then, he bought 5 teddy bears for $1 each, so that's 5 x $1 = $5. 

Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and teddy bears: $12 + $5 = $17. 

Dean's mom gave him $28, and then she gave him an extra $10, so he now has $28 + $10 = $38. 

To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he has: $38 - $17 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Morgan's dad said she has $90 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to play mini-golf, get arcade tokens, and ride go-karts. A round of mini-golf costs $5, and the go-karts cost $10 per ride. Morgan wants to play one round of mini-golf, get $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities for Morgan and her friends. The cost of mini-golf is $5, the cost of arcade tokens is $5, and the cost of go-karts is 2 rides * $10 = $20. The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. $90 - $30 = $60.

Now, we need to subtract Morgan's cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. Morgan's cost is $5, so $60 - $5 = $55.

Each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. $55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 1.83 ≈ 1

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the arcade tokens in the cost per friend. The cost per friend is actually $30 + $5 = $35.

"Let's figure out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank.

Marisa gets $5 every day from her parents. She buys 4 lollipops for 25 cents each. First, we need to find out how much money she spends on lollipops each day. 

4 lollipops cost 25 cents each, so we multiply 4 x 25 cents. To do this, we can convert 25 cents to dollars, which is $0.25. Now, we multiply 4 x $0.25.

4 x $0.25 = $1

Now, we subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money to find out how much she saves each day.

Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Cost of lollipops
Daily savings = $5 - $1
Daily savings = $4

Now, we need to find out how much she saves in 5 days. We multiply her daily savings by 5.

Total savings = Daily savings x Number of days
Total savings = $4 x 5
Total savings = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Billy has $10 to spend on candy. The candy costs $1.5 per pound. He buys some candy and then uses half of his change to buy gumballs that cost $0.05 each. He buys 40 gumballs.

First, let's find out how much money Billy has left after buying the candy. If he buys x pounds of candy, the total cost of the candy is 1.5x dollars. So, he has 10 - 1.5x dollars left.

He then takes half of this amount and spends it on gumballs. Since he buys 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since he takes half of his change, the amount he spends on gumballs is half of (10 - 1.5x), which is (10 - 1.5x) / 2.

We know that the amount he spends on gumballs is $2, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

So Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Carver is 45 years old, and his son is 5 years younger than twice Carver's age. We can write this as an equation:

2x - 5 = 45

Where 'x' is the son's age. To find 'x', we need to get it by itself on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides:

2x - 5 + 5 = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Now, we need to get rid of the 2 that's being multiplied by 'x'. We can do this by dividing both sides by 2:

(2x) / 2 = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to know how far it travels in one day and how far it can go before it needs service.

First, let's find out how far the train travels in one trip. It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 125 miles from the third city to the first city (since 75 + 100 - 50 = 125). So, the total distance in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, it travels 300 miles * 3 = 900 miles in one day.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total distance between services by the total distance it travels in a day. 

18,000 miles / 900 miles per day = 20 days

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much stuffing Mark needs, we need to know how much stuffing each kind of bed needs. A Rottweiler bed needs 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds of stuffing. A collie bed needs the average of these two amounts. 

To find the average, we add the two amounts and divide by 2. 
Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 
Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To find out how long it took John to get to his friend's house, we need to know the distance and his speed. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at 70 miles per hour. 

Distance to friend's house = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 miles / 70 mph
Time = 2.857 hours (or 2 hours and 51.43 minutes)

But John had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the total distance to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles.

Time to friend's house = 210 miles / 70 mph
Time to friend's house = 3 hours

Now, let's find out how long it took John to get back home. The distance is 240 miles, and he drives at 80 mph.

Distance back home = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

So, the total time John took for the trip is 3 hours to get to his friend's house and 3 hours to get back home.

Total time = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to know how many boys were there in the first place and then subtract the number of boys who were absent.

There are 96 fourth-graders in total. We know that 43 of them are girls. So, to find the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of fourth-graders.

Number of boys = Total number of fourth-graders - Number of girls
= 96 - 43
= 53

Now, we know that 5 girls and 4 boys were absent. To find the number of boys who were present, we need to subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

Number of boys present = Number of boys - Number of absent boys
= 53 - 4

"To pass to the next school year, Jane needs to get at least 42 points from her 3 tests. She already got 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. To find out how many points she needs on the third test, we need to subtract the points she already has from the total points she needs.

Let's do the math:

Total points needed = 42
Points she already has = 15 + 18 = 33

Now, let's subtract the points she has from the total points needed:

Points needed on the third test = Total points needed - Points she already has
= 42 - 33
= 9

So, Jane needs to get at least 9 points on the third test to pass to the next school year.

"So, let's figure this out. We know that 3 people were kicked out of Walmart for not wearing masks. Then, 4 times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. That's 4 x 3 - 5 = 7 people. 

Next, 3 times the number of people kicked out for shoplifting were kicked out for being violent. That's 3 x 7 = 21 people.

Now, we know that a total of 50 people were kicked out. We need to find out how many were kicked out for other reasons. Let's add up the people we already know about: 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. 

So, if 31 people were kicked out for those reasons, and 50 people were kicked out in total, then 50 - 31 = 19 people were kicked out for other reasons.

"Let's figure out how many points Erin had before she scored 14 points. We know that Erin now has 14 points and that she has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points.

To find out how many points Erin has now, we multiply Sara's points by 3. 

3 * 8 = 24

But we know Erin has 14 points now, not 24. So, we need to find out how many points Erin had before she scored 14 points. To do that, we need to know how many points Erin had in total before she scored 14 points. We can find that by adding Sara's points to Erin's current points.

Sara's points = 8
Erin's current points = 14
Erin's total points now = 3 * Sara's points = 24

Erin's points before = Erin's total points now - Erin's current points
Erin's points before = 24 - 14
Erin's points before = 10

"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to add up the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's find the cost of the picture frames. There are 44 seniors, and each picture frame costs $20. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 x $20 = $880.

Next, we need to find the cost of etching the picture frames. The etching costs 20% of the cost of the picture frame, which is $20. 20% of $20 is 0.2 x $20 = $4. So, the cost of etching each picture frame is $4. Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of etching is 44 x $4 = $176.

Now, let's add the cost of the picture frames and the etching: $880 + $176 = $1056.

We also need to add the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each, so the total cost of the pins is 2 x $5 = $10.

Next, we need to find the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, and there are 44 seniors in total. 1/4 of 44 is 11, so 11 seniors will receive cords. Each cord costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is 11 x $12 = $132.

Finally, we add up the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. 
20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"Let's figure out how many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. That's like 14 groups of 2 shoes, so they sold 14 x 2 = 28 shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday. Double 14 is 2 x 14 = 28, so they sold 28 pairs of shoes on Saturday. That's 28 x 2 = 56 shoes.

On Sunday, they sold half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday. Half of 28 is 28 / 2 = 14, so they sold 14 pairs of shoes on Sunday. That's 14 x 2 = 28 shoes.

But, six people returned their shoes on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 shoes from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. 28 - 12 = 16 shoes.

Now, let's add up the number of shoes sold on each day: 28 (Friday) + 56 (Saturday) + 16 (Sunday) = 100 shoes.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Mary has 30 sheep. We need to find out how much milk she collects every day. We know that she gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep and 2 kg of milk from the other half.

First, let's find out how many sheep are in each half. Since there are 30 sheep in total, we can divide 30 by 2 to get the number of sheep in each half.

30 ÷ 2 = 15

So, there are 15 sheep in each half. Now, let's find out how much milk Mary gets from each half.

Milk from the first half: 15 x 1 kg = 15 kg
Milk from the second half: 15 x 2 kg = 30 kg

Now, let's add the milk from both halves to find the total milk collected.

15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

First, we need to know how many rolls she had left after feeding her 6 children. Since she started with a dozen rolls, which is 12 rolls, and she fed 6 children, we subtract 6 from 12 to find out how many rolls were left. 

12 - 6 = 6

So, Mrs. Sherman had 6 rolls left. Now, we need to find out how many pieces she got from these 6 rolls. Since she broke each roll into 8 pieces, we multiply 6 rolls by 8 pieces per roll.

6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 6 * 8 = 48

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

We know that Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday for $56. Since she sells each apple for $4, we can find out how many apples she picked on Monday by dividing the money she made by the price of each apple:

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. To find out how many apples she picked on Wednesday, we multiply the number of apples she picked on Tuesday by 2:

The principal is $3,650, the rate is 10% or 0.10, and the time is 5 months. 

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $3,650 * 0.5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan owes: $3,650 + $1,825 = $5,475.

To find out how much she has to pay each month, we divide the total amount by the number of months: $5,475 / 5 = $1,095.

Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. To find out how far Cho hiked, we multiply the speed by the time. Cho hiked 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km.

Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. To find out how far Chloe hiked, we multiply her speed by the time. Chloe hiked 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km.

Now, we need to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked than Chloe. We do this by subtracting Chloe's distance from Cho's distance. Cho hiked 112 km and Chloe hiked 45 km, so Cho hiked 112 - 45 = 67 km farther.

To find the total number of silver pesos they have together, we add Axel's silver pesos to Anna's silver pesos: 50 + 100 = 150.

To find the total number of gold pesos they have together, we add Axel's gold pesos to Anna's gold pesos: 80 + 120 = 200.

Now, we need to find out how much money she spent on supplies. She spent $18 on supplies.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total money she made: $36 - $18 = $18.

Next, we need to find out how many hours she spends selling lemonade. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour and she has 36 cups to sell. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cups by the cups she sells per hour: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, we need to find the profit per hour. We divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 hours = $2/hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. This means he has 2/5 of his land left. We can set up an equation to find out how much land he had at first.

Let's say the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had is x hectares. Since he has 2/5 of his land left, we can write the equation:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5/2.

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how many people sang in the performance, we need to figure out how many girls were in the choir and then subtract the ones who couldn't make it, and add the teachers who sang with them.

First, we need to find 50% of 52, which is half of 52. To find half of a number, we divide it by 2. So, 52 / 2 = 26. This means there are 26 girls in the choir.

Now, we need to find half of 26, because half the people performing couldn't make it to the show. Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.

The total number of people performing is the number of girls minus the number of girls who couldn't make it, plus the number of teachers. So, the total number of people performing is 26 - 13 + 3 = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to find the average of his 5 test scores. 

First, we add up all the scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Then, we divide the sum by the number of scores to find the average:
400 ÷ 5 = 80

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we need to multiply the number of erasers by the cost of one eraser and the number of pencils by the cost of one pencil, then add the two amounts together.

6 erasers cost 6 x $2 = $12
8 pencils cost 8 x $3 = $24

Now, we add the two amounts together: $12 + $24 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) × 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"Let's figure out how much money David saves.

First, we need to know how much it costs for Dasha to ride all 9 rides. Each ride costs $4 because it's 2 tickets at $2 each. So, 9 rides will cost 9 x $4 = $36.

Now, let's see how much it costs David. He buys a ride bracelet for $30, and it gives him 9 rides. This means he doesn't have to pay for any tickets.

To find out how much money David saves, we need to subtract the cost of his ride bracelet from the cost of Dasha's tickets. So, $36 (Dasha's cost) - $30 (David's cost) = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts. 

First, let's find the total number of gifts: 
6 (family) + 4 (friends) + 2 (teachers) = 12 gifts

Now, let's divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that the ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. The total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

To find out how many popsicles each person has, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the ratio parts (5+6=11). Then, we multiply the result by the respective ratio parts.

Let's do the math:

Total number of popsicles = 165
Sum of ratio parts = 5 + 6 = 11

Now, let's find the number of popsicles each person has:
Betty's popsicles = (5/11) × 165 = 75
Sam's popsicles = (6/11) × 165 = 90

Now, let's find the difference in the number of popsicles between Sam and Betty:
Difference = Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles = 90 - 75 = 15

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is: 15"
"So, Tim wants to know how much money he'll save by canceling his cable subscription and getting streaming services instead. He gets Netflix for $10 a month. Then he gets Hulu and Disney Plus, which normally cost $10 each, but he gets a discount for buying them together.

Let's first find out how much he pays for Hulu and Disney Plus together. That's $10 + $10 = $20. Now, he gets a 20% discount on that. To find 20% of $20, we multiply $20 by 0.2. That's $20 x 0.2 = $4. So, the discount is $4.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. That's $20 - $4 = $16. So, he pays $16 for Hulu and Disney Plus.

Now, we add the cost of Netflix to the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. That's $10 + $16 = $26. This is how much he pays for the streaming services.

Now, we need to find out how much he saves by canceling his cable subscription. He was paying $60 for the cable package. So, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package. That's $60 - $26 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find out what percentage of the time Carol spent editing, we need to know how much time she spent on each part of making the song. 

She spent 4 hours writing the song. Then, she spent half that time recording it, which is 4 / 2 = 2 hours. 

We need to convert the time she spent editing from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 90 minutes is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.

Now, we add up all the time she spent: 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage of time she spent editing, we divide the time she spent editing (1.5 hours) by the total time (7.5 hours) and multiply by 100.

(1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Wendy needs, we need to figure out how many books are in the shelving system first. The system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns to get the total number of books.

6 rows * 6 columns = 6 * 6 = 36 books

Now, we need to find double the number of books. To do that, we multiply 36 by 2.

2 * 36 = 72 books

Wendy wants to put 20 more books than double the number of books, so we add 20 to 72.

72 + 20 = 92 books

So, Wendy needs 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"Let's figure out how many Valentine's cards Erica has now.

First, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards. Then, her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards. Each box has 15 cards, so she got 2 x 15 = 30 cards from her dad.

Now, Erica has 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

Next, Erica gave away some cards. She gave 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family. So, she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

To find out how many cards Erica has left, we need to subtract the cards she gave away from the total number of cards she had. 50 - 29 = 21 cards.

Then, Erica received some cards from her family and friends. She got 17 cards.

To find out how many cards Erica has now, we need to add the cards she received to the cards she had left. 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

The final answer is: 38"
"Let's figure out how many slices of pizza are left. 

First, we need to find out how many slices Jenny gave away. She gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. To find 1/3 of 12, we can multiply 12 by 1 and then divide by 3. That's 12 ÷ 3 = 4 slices. 

Next, Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. To find 1/4 of 12, we can multiply 12 by 1 and then divide by 4. That's 12 ÷ 4 = 3 slices.

So, Jenny gave away a total of 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny also ate 2 slices. To find the total number of slices she gave away and ate, we add 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

Now, we need to find out how many slices are left. We can do this by subtracting the total number of slices Jenny gave away and ate from the total number of slices. That's 12 - 9 = 3 slices.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many days Mark has to save his money, we need to divide the cost of the bike by the amount he earns per day.

Let's do the math:

Cost of the bike: $300
Amount earned per day: $10

Number of days = Cost of the bike ÷ Amount earned per day
= $300 ÷ $10
= 30

So, Mark has to save his money for 30 days to buy the bike."
"Let's count the bugs in Nancy's woodshed. We know she saw 90 spiders. Then, she saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders. To find the number of millipedes, we need to divide 90 by 3.

90 ÷ 3 = 30

So, there are 30 millipedes. Now, let's find the number of stink bugs. We know it's equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. We can write this as:

2 × 30 - 12

First, we multiply 2 and 30:
2 × 30 = 60

Then, we subtract 12 from 60:
60 - 12 = 48

So, there are 48 stink bugs. To find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168

The final answer is: 168"
"Let's figure out the difference between Alice and Erica's ages.

We know that Erica is 30 years old. We also know that Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so we add 5 to Erica's age to find Beth's age: 30 + 5 = 35.

Now, we know that Alice is 7 years older than Beth. To find Alice's age, we add 7 to Beth's age: 35 + 7 = 42.

To find the difference between Alice and Erica's ages, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age: 42 - 30 = 12.

"To find out how many calories John consumed, we need to know how much milk he drank and how many calories are in each ounce of milk. We know that John drank 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, we multiply the number of glasses by the number of ounces in each glass: 2 x 8 = 16 ounces.

Now, we need to know how many calories are in each ounce of milk. We're told that milk has 3 calories per ounce. To find the total calories, we multiply the total ounces by the calories per ounce: 16 x 3 = 48 calories.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we need to know how many days he works and how much he gets paid each day.

First, let's find out how many days he works in a year. He works 4 weeks every month, and there are 12 months in a year. So, the total number of weeks he works in a year is 4 * 12 = 48 weeks.

Since he works 6 days every week, the total number of days he works in a year is 48 * 6 = 288 days.

Now, let's find out his daily earnings. He gets paid $50 every day.

So, his total earnings in a year would be his daily earnings multiplied by the number of days he works in a year.
Total earnings = $50 * 288
Total earnings = $14400

The final answer is: $14400"
"To make a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark needs to get more flour and milk. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles.

First, let's figure out how many bags of flour Mark needs. We multiply the amount of flour in the recipe by 4 to get the total amount of flour needed for the quadruple batch. 

3 cups (normal recipe) * 4 = 12 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we need to divide the total amount of flour needed by 2 to find out how many bags Mark needs to buy.

12 cups ÷ 2 cups/bag = 6 bags

Next, we do the same for the milk. We multiply the amount of milk in the normal recipe by 4 to get the total amount of milk needed for the quadruple batch.

1 cup (normal recipe) * 4 = 4 cups

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we need to divide the total amount of milk needed by 2 to find out how many bottles Mark needs to buy.

4 cups ÷ 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles

Now, we need to find out how many more bags of flour Mark needs to buy than bottles of milk. We subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour.

6 bags - 2 bottles = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much energy Mel saves, we need to know how much energy he uses with the air conditioner on and off. 

First, we need to find out how much energy he uses in a day. The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. If he uses it for 8 hours a day, the energy used is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh). We can also write this as 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh).

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he uses it for 3 hours a day. The energy used is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh or 2.7 kWh.

Now, we need to find out how much energy he saves per day. We subtract the new energy used from the original energy used: 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To find out how much energy he saves in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30: 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we need to add up all the stripes and divide by the number of zebras.

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.
There is one zebra with 36 stripes.
There is another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Let's add up all the stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

Now, we need to know how many zebras there are. There are 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 zebras.

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 ÷ 4 = 22.

"To make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game, we need to figure out how much money Tyson will spend on meat and cheese. Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and it serves 4 people. There are 20 people watching the game.

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. We divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves: 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

Since each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, Tyson needs 5 pounds of each. 

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese: $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Allan has twice as many corns as cannolis. If he has 40 cannolis, then he has 2 x 40 = 80 corns.

Now, Allan buys 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he bought 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

To find the total number of corns and cannolis, we add the initial number of corns and cannolis to the number of corns and cannolis Allan bought:

Initial corns: 80
Initial cannolis: 40
Corns bought: 20
Cannolis bought: 60

Total corns: 80 + 20 = 100
Total cannolis: 40 + 60 = 100

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 100 = 200."
"Let's figure out how many steps Elliott took during his jog. 

Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps a day. He already walked half of that, which is 5,000 steps, to and from school. Then, he walked 1,000 more steps with his friend. 

So, before his jog, Elliott walked a total of 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps and he already walked 6,000, that means he has 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps left to walk.

But, after his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to walk. This means that during his jog, he must have walked 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps.

The final answer is: 2000"
"Let's figure out how many minutes early Toby will be at the airport.

First, we need to find out how long it will take Toby to read the book. We know the book has 45 pages and each page has 200 words. So, we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page:

45 pages × 200 words/page = 9000 words

Now, we need to find out how long it will take Toby to read 9000 words. We know he can read 300 words per minute. To find the time, we divide the total number of words by his reading rate:

9000 words ÷ 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so we add that to the time it takes to read the book:

30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, so we subtract the time he arrives from the time he has to be there:

60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early at the airport.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the company paid to the employees in May. We know that there are 40 employees, and each employee works 40 hours a week for 4 weeks. So, the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 160 hours. Since each employee is paid $15 per hour, the total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 hours * $15/hour = $2400. Now, we multiply this by the number of employees to get the total amount paid in May: 40 employees * $2400/employee = $96,000.

Next, we need to find out how much money the company paid to the employees in June. We know that 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee still works 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 160 hours. Since each employee is paid $15 per hour, the total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 hours * $15/hour = $2400. Now, we multiply this by the number of employees to get the total amount paid in June: 30 employees * $2400/employee = $72,000.

Now, we add the total amount paid in May and June to get the final answer: $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

$168,000"
"Let's figure out how much money Sally has left.

First, we need to find out how much the taffy costs. The sale says ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that the second pound of taffy is half off, so it costs $1.50. To find the total cost of the taffy, we add the cost of the first pound ($3) and the cost of the second pound ($1.50). The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we need to find the total cost of the other items Sally bought. The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50 and the 4 magnets cost 4 x $0.25 = $1. We add these costs together to get $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, we add the cost of the taffy ($4.50) and the cost of the other items ($2.50) to get the total cost of everything Sally bought. The total cost is $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so we need to subtract the total cost of the items she bought ($7) from the amount of money she started with ($10). $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"Let's figure out how much Tim spent on fireworks.

First, we need to find the total cost of the fireworks. He bought two packages of fireworks. The first one costs $400, and the second one costs twice as much, which is 2 x $400 = $800.

So, the total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Now, Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find 20% of $1200, we multiply $1200 by 0.2, which is 0.2 x $1200 = $240.

The discount is $240, so we subtract that from the total cost of the fireworks: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Next, we need to add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150.

So, the total amount Tim spent is $960 (fireworks) + $150 (finale firework) = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To figure out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to know how many cookies she eats in 30 days and then divide that number by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she eats in 30 days, we multiply 2 by 30:
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs:
60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of the candles smell like wet dog, so we multiply 50000 by 0.05. That's 50000 x 0.05 = 2500 candles that smell like wet dog.

Next, we need to find the number of candles that are more likely to explode. Since Marcy guarantees that 99% of her candles won't explode, that means 1% of the candles are more likely to explode. So, we multiply 50000 by 0.01. That's 50000 x 0.01 = 500 candles that are more likely to explode.

Now, we need to find out how many of those candles that are more likely to explode also smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the candles that are more likely to explode smell like wet dog. So, we multiply 500 by 0.05. That's 500 x 0.05 = 25 candles.

The number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25."
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The regular price of each blouse is $20. To find the discount amount, we multiply the regular price by 30% (or 0.3). 

So, the discount amount is $20 * 0.3 = $6.

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price of each blouse: $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price by 4 to get the total cost: $14 * 4 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's figure out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

We know that Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathered 2 x 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathered half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathered 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathered 3 x 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

We don't know how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, so let's call that number 'x'. The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.

The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so 45 + x + 105 = 500.

Now, let's solve for x:
45 + x + 105 = 500
x + 150 = 500
x = 350

"Let's solve the problem. We have a herd with camels and dromedaries. We know there are 180 heads and 304 bumps. Camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump.

Let's say the number of camels is C and the number of dromedaries is D. We can write two equations:

1. The total number of heads is 180, so C + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304, so 2C + D = 304.

We can solve these equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to find C:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

The final answer is: 56"
"Let's break down Tom's trip into smaller parts to find the total distance he traveled.

First, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for 4 days. To find the total distance, we multiply the distance by the number of days:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days for 2 days. To find 30% of 800 km, we multiply 800 by 0.3 (since 30% is the same as 30/100 or 0.3):
0.3 * 800 km = 240 km
So, the total distance traveled in the next 2 days is 240 km.

Then, he didn't travel at all on the next day, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

Finally, during the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. To find the total distance, we multiply the distance by the number of days:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"Let's figure out how big Timothy's locker is. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. 

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply 5 by 4 to find out how big Zack's locker is. 
5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches (Zack's locker size)

Now, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. To find out how big Timothy's locker is, we can multiply 20 by 2. 
2 * 20 = 40 cubic inches (Timothy's locker size)

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 40"
"So, let's figure out how much Oliver needs to climb to find Stanley's comb. We know Stanley was standing at 10,000 feet, and his comb fell 4,000 feet. That means the comb is now at 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet.

Now, we need to find out how much higher Oliver is than the comb. Oliver is at 3,000 feet, and the comb is at 6,000 feet. To find the difference, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

So, Oliver needs to climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

The final answer is: 3000"
"Let's figure out how much money Mr. Josue has now.

First, we know Mr. Josue had $5000 already. Then, he got some money from two banks. The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 x $4000 = $8000.

So, the second bank gave him $8000. To find the total amount of money he got from the banks, we add $4000 and $8000. That's $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Now, we need to add the money he got from the banks to the money he already had. So, we add $5000 (the money he already had) to $12000 (the money he got from the banks). That's $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we start with 50 cats on the rock. Then, 4 boats came and took away 5 cats each. To find out how many cats were taken away, we multiply 4 by 5, which is 4 × 5 = 20. 

Now, we subtract 20 from 50 to find out how many cats are left on the rock: 50 - 20 = 30.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find out how many cats ran, we multiply 3/5 by 30: (3/5) × 30 = 18.

Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, there are 12 cats left on the rock.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's figure out how much Bill paid for the streaming service. 

First, we need to find out how many months are in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so 2 years is 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Now, let's break it down into the different price periods. The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 x $8 = $48.

The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 x $12 = $96.

The remaining months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months) were $14 a month, so the cost for this period is 10 x $14 = $140.

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Let's figure out how much more the jogger jeans cost than the tattered jeans.

First, we know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. If we let T be the cost of the tattered jeans, then the jogger jeans cost T - 6 dollars.

We also know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and 2/3 from the tattered jeans. This means that 1/3 of the jogger jeans' cost minus 6 is equal to 2/3 of the tattered jeans' cost. We can write this as:

(1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6

To get rid of the fractions, we can multiply both sides by 3:

T - 6 + 2T = 18

Now, let's combine like terms:

3T - 6 = 18

Add 6 to both sides:

3T = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

T = 8

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans:

J = T - 6
J = 8 - 6
J = 2

So, the jogger jeans cost $2 less than the tattered jeans. However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans cost $2 less, the answer is actually the opposite of what we found.

The final answer is: $2"
"So, let's figure out how many employees can go on the day trip. We have 4 big buses that can hold 60 people each. To find out how many people can fit in the buses, we multiply the number of buses by the number of people each bus can hold: 4 x 60 = 240.

We also have 6 smaller buses called minibusses that can hold 30 people each. To find out how many people can fit in the minibusses, we multiply the number of minibusses by the number of people each can hold: 6 x 30 = 180.

And we have 10 minivans that can hold 15 people each. To find out how many people can fit in the minivans, we multiply the number of minivans by the number of people each can hold: 10 x 15 = 150.

Now, we add up the number of people that can fit in each type of vehicle: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570.

The final answer is: 570"
"So, Lillian wants to know how many birds she can expect to see in her garden each day. She made 3 bird feeders and bought 3 more. Each of her homemade bird feeders attracts 30 birds (20 birds + 10 more birds than the store-bought ones). To find the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders, we multiply the number of homemade feeders by the number of birds each one attracts: 3 * 30 = 90.

The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each. To find the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders, we multiply the number of store-bought feeders by the number of birds each one attracts: 3 * 20 = 60.

Now, we add the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders to find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day: 90 + 60 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find out how much Aleksandra needs to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the soup. The bagel costs $4, and the soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 4 × 0.25 = 1. So, the soup costs 4 + 1 = $5.

Next, let's find the cost of the cake. The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is 4 ÷ 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To find out how many Pokémon cards Kenny started with, we need to figure out how many cards he sold. Since he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he needs to make $50 from selling the cards.

Each card is sold for $1.5, so we can find the number of cards he sold by dividing the amount he needs ($50) by the price per card ($1.5).

Number of cards sold = $50 ÷ $1.5 = 33.33 (we can't sell a fraction of a card, so we round down to 33)

Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards ""x"". Then, 2/3 * x = 33.33

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 33.33 * (3/2)
x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's figure out how many guests didn't get a second hotdog.

First, we need to know how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. He made enough for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs. Half of 36 is 18, so 18 guests were prepared for to have two hotdogs. That's 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs.

The other half of the guests (also 18) were prepared for one hotdog each, so that's 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs.

In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

But then, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. That's 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs needed.

Since there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs were not enough. This means 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 6 + 7 = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"So, Charlotte wants to buy some kitchen stuff. She wants a set of pots and pans for $120, a set of mixing bowls for $20, and 5 separate utensils for $5 each. We need to find out how much she'll pay after the store gives her a 20% discount.

First, let's add up the cost of all the things she wants to buy:

$120 (pots and pans) + $20 (mixing bowls) = $140
$140 + $25 (5 utensils at $5 each) = $165

Now, we need to find 20% of $165. To do that, we multiply $165 by 0.20 (which is the same as 20%):

$165 x 0.20 = $33

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:

$165 - $33 = $132

So, Charlotte will pay $132 for all the kitchen stuff."
"To find out how much more money Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball, we need to add up the cost of all the items and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. So, the total cost is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball."
"Let's figure out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. 

First, we need to find out how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who slew 100 dragons. Three quarters of 100 is 75. 

To find three quarters of 100, we multiply 100 by 3 and then divide by 4. This can be written as:

(3/4) * 100 = (3 * 100) / 4
= 300 / 4
= 75

So, Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons.

Next, we need to find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so we multiply 75 by 2:

2 * 75 = 150

Now, we need to find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so we multiply 150 by 1/5:

(1/5) * 150 = 150 / 5
= 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we need to do a few steps.

First, we need to divide the 15 gallons of gas into 5 equal parts. To do this, we divide 15 by 5.

15 ÷ 5 = 3

So each container has 3 gallons of gas. Now, we need to find out how many pints are in 3 gallons. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints.

3 gallons × 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints

Now, we need to find out how many pints Josey needed. She needed 1/4 of a container, which is 1/4 of 3 gallons.

1/4 × 3 = 0.75 gallons

To convert 0.75 gallons to pints, we multiply 0.75 by 8.

0.75 × 8 = 6 pints

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. This means he spent 99% of his money. To find out how much he spent, we need to calculate 99% of $5.

99% of $5 is equal to 0.99 x $5 = $4.95.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, and he bought 3 bags. So, the total cost of chips is 3 x 40 cents = $1.20.

Now, let's subtract the cost of chips from the total amount he spent: $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.

This means he spent $3.75 on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find out how many candy bars he bought by dividing $3.75 by 0.75.

$3.75 ÷ 0.75 = 5

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's figure out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends got.

Ray had 25 lollipops. He kept 5 for himself, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

25 - 5 = 20

Now, we know Ray shared 20 lollipops with his 4 friends. To find out how many each friend got, we need to divide the shared lollipops by the number of friends.

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends got 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much cake is left, we need to know how much cake Rory and her mom ate. Since they each had a piece, we need to find out how much cake is in one piece.

There are 8 pieces of cake in total, and the cake weighs 20 ounces. To find out how much cake is in one piece, we can divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces.

20 ounces ÷ 8 = 2.5 ounces

This means each piece of cake weighs 2.5 ounces. Since Rory and her mom each had a piece, they ate a total of 2 pieces. 

2 pieces × 2.5 ounces = 5 ounces

Now, we need to find out how much cake is left. To do this, we subtract the weight of the cake they ate from the total weight of the cake.

20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces

So, there are 15 ounces of cake left.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's figure out how many oranges everyone will get. 

First, we need to find out how many oranges Sitti and Juris have in total. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

To find the total number of oranges, we add the number of oranges Sitti and Juris have:
34 + 22 = 56

Now, we need to find out how many people are sharing the oranges. Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends are sharing the oranges, so there are 8 people in total.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:
56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"Let's figure out the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup.

First, we need to find out how much it costs to make the soup. Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he wants to double that, so he needs 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of onions. Onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the onions will cost 4 x $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock. Each box costs $2.00, so the beef stock will cost 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock together. $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so we need to divide the total cost by 6 to find the cost per serving. $12.00 ÷ 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's figure out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne to get to the theater first.

We know that Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater. Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, we can multiply 4 by 4 to find out how long Bernadette's drive takes. 

4 × 4 = 16 minutes

So, Bernadette takes 16 minutes to get to the theater. Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we need to add 5 minutes to Bernadette's travel time. 

16 + 5 = 21 minutes

This means Bernadette needs to leave 21 minutes before Wayne arrives at the theater. 

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's room, we need to know the length and width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet because there are 3 feet in a yard.

3 yards = 3 x 3 = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length x width
360 = 9 x width
To find the width, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 9:
width = 360 ÷ 9
width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room:
Perimeter = 2 x (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 x (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 x 49
Perimeter = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"Let's figure out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack has 20 beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack has 20 beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"So, let's figure out the final temperature of Marcus's house. 

First, we need to find out how much the temperature increases when the oven is on. The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. To find the total increase, we multiply the number of hours by the temperature increase per hour: 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.

Next, we need to find out how much the temperature decreases when the window is open. The window is open for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes, the house cools down 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Now, we add the temperature increase to the initial temperature and subtract the temperature decrease: 40 degrees + 15 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"Let's figure out how long it took James to run in the triathlon.

First, we need to find out how long it took James to do the whole triathlon. We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, and it took him 170 minutes to finish. So, James took 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to swim and bike. We know that James swims 10% faster than Jon. To find 10% of 40 minutes, we multiply 40 by 0.1, which is 4. So, James swims 40 - 4 = 36 minutes. We also know that James takes 5 minutes longer to bike than Jon, so he takes 80 + 5 = 85 minutes to bike.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to run. We know that James took 180 minutes to finish the triathlon, and he took 36 minutes to swim and 85 minutes to bike. So, we subtract those times from 180 to find out how long he took to run: 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to figure out how long it is. We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours. To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60. So, Movie C is 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Now, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 to 75 to get the length of Movie B. Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Finally, we know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find one-fourth of 80, we divide 80 by 4. Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's figure out how much change Michael has after buying hay for his horse.

First, we need to find out how far the horse runs. The horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. To find the distance, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Now, we multiply the speed by the time to find the distance: 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we need to know how many eggs she has and how many eggs are needed for each glass of eggnog. 

First, let's count the eggs. Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs in cases, and 2 loose eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we multiply 4 by 12 to get the total number of eggs in the cases. 4 x 12 = 48. Then, we add the 2 loose eggs to get the total number of eggs. 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Now, we need to know how many eggs are needed for each glass of eggnog. Each glass needs 5 eggs. To find out how many glasses Rozanne can make, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed for each glass. 50 ÷ 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we need to divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 ÷ 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the salesman made from selling the sneakers. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each on Monday, so we multiply 17 by 20:

17 x $20 = $340

This is the money he made from the flash sale on Monday.

Next, he sold the rest of the sneakers to a department store for $25 each. To find out how many sneakers he sold to the department store, we subtract the number of sneakers he sold on Monday from the total number of sneakers:

48 - 17 = 31

So, he sold 31 sneakers to the department store. Now, we multiply 31 by 25 to find out how much money he made from the department store sale:

31 x $25 = $775

Now, we add the money he made from the flash sale and the department store sale to find the total amount of money he made:

$340 + $775 = $1115

The salesman bought the sneakers for $576. To find out how much profit he made, we subtract the cost from the total amount of money he made:

$1115 - $576 = $539

So, the salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to add the number of crayons in the packets with 8 pieces each and the packets with 16 pieces each.

First, let's find the total number of crayons in the packets with 8 pieces each: 6 x 8 = 48

Next, we find the total number of crayons in the packets with 16 pieces each: 4 x 16 = 64

Now, we add the number of crayons in both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112

"Let's figure out the price of popcorn.

If you buy a super ticket for $20, it includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra. This means that the super ticket costs $20 and the extra $1 is for the popcorn and soda together.

If you buy a regular ticket for $12 and a soda for $3, the total cost is $15. If you buy the super ticket for $20 and save $2, the total cost is $18. The difference between the two scenarios is $18 - $15 = $3.

This $3 difference is the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket. Since the super ticket includes the popcorn for $1 extra, the regular price of the popcorn is $3 - $1 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's figure out how much it costs to fill 170 balloons. 

First, we need to know how much it costs to fill one balloon. We know that it costs $900 to fill 20 balloons. To find the cost of one balloon, we divide the total cost by the number of balloons: $900 ÷ 20 = $45.

Now, we know that the cost of filling one balloon went up by $20. So, the new cost of filling one balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

To find the cost of filling 170 balloons, we multiply the new cost of one balloon by 170: $65 × 170 = $11,050.

The final answer is: $11,050"
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to know how far it traveled and how long it took. 

First, let's find out how far the car went. We know it went 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, and then 30 miles per hour for 1 hour. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance1 = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles
Distance2 = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles
Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Now, let's find the total time it took. We know it took 2 hours to go 60 miles per hour and 1 hour to go 30 miles per hour. 

Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 x $800 = $4000.

The value of the rubies she received is 2 x $1200 = $2400.

To find the total value of her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the rubies together: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"Let's figure out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days.

We know that Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. To find out how many apples they eat together, we need to add the number of apples they each eat. 

4 (apples Marin eats) + 4 (apples Nancy eats) = 8 apples

Now, we need to multiply the number of apples they eat together by the number of days. We want to know how many apples they eat in 30 days.

8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

So, Marin and Nancy eat 240 apples in 30 days."
"To find out how much potting soil Bob needs, we have to figure out how much space is in each bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

Each bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. To find the space in one bed, we multiply these numbers together: 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 beds, we multiply the space in one bed by 10: 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Now, we need to know how many bags of potting soil Bob needs. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so we divide the total space needed by 2: 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag: 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"Let's figure out how many cards there are in total. We know there are 15 red cards. The green cards are 60% more than the red cards. To find 60% of 15, we multiply 15 by 0.6. 

15 × 0.6 = 9

So, there are 9 more green cards than red cards. To find the total number of green cards, we add 9 to 15.

15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards. So, we add 15 and 24.

15 + 24 = 39

Now, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards to find the total number of cards.

15 + 24 + 39 = 78

The final answer is: 78"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. Then, 20 minutes later, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means 50 / 2 = 25 fairies joined the group.

So, the total number of fairies now is 50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75.

After that, 30 fairies flew away. To find the number of fairies remaining, we need to subtract 30 from 75.

75 - 30 = 45

So, there are 45 fairies remaining.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to know how many puppies in total and how many of them have spots. Jennifer has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots. Brandon has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots.

First, let's add up the total number of puppies. We do this by adding 8 and 12 together.

8 + 12 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. We do this by adding 3 and 4 together.

3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

(7 ÷ 20) * 100 = 35%

So, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we need to know how much stuff he's buying and how much his truck can carry.

First, let's calculate the total weight of all the feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up all the weights: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips he needs to make, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

3400 ÷ 2250 = 1.511

Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a month from recycling, we need to calculate how much she earns in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's find out how much she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles each week. 

Aluminum cans: 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week
Plastic bottles: 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Now, let's add the earnings from both cans and bottles to find the total earnings per week:
6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month

So, Grayson earns 84 cents in a month from recycling.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's figure out how many plants Shondra has.

First, we need to find out how many plants Toni has. We know that Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. Since Frederick has 10 plants, we can find 60% of 10 by multiplying 10 by 0.6.

60% of 10 = 0.6 x 10 = 6

Now, we add 6 to 10 to find out how many plants Toni has:
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. We know Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we subtract 7 from 16:
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's figure out how much money Ali has now. 

First, we need to find out how much money Leila gave Ali. Since Leila gave him half of her $100, we need to divide 100 by 2. 

100 ÷ 2 = 50

So, Leila gave Ali $50. 

Now, we need to add this to the money Ali already had, which is $21. 

$21 + $50 = $71

So, Ali now has $71.

The final answer is: $71"
"To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to calculate 1/5 of the cost of the pizza and add it to the cost of the pizza.

The cost of the pizza is $15. To find 1/5 of the cost, we can multiply $15 by 1/5.

1/5 of $15 = (1/5) × $15
= $15 ÷ 5
= $3

So, the tip is $3. To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza.

Total amount = Cost of the pizza + Tip
= $15 + $3
= $18

The final answer is: $18"
"Let's figure out where Finley finished in the 100-meter race. 

She started in first place. Then she fell back 5 spots, so she was in 6th place. 

Next, she moved ahead 2 spots, so she was in 4th place. 

Then she fell behind 3 spots, so she was in 7th place. 

Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot to finish the race, so she was in 6th place.

So, Finley finished in 6th place.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's figure out how many students Miss Maria has. 

First, we need to find out how many cards she has in total. She has 6 decks of basketball cards, and each deck has 25 cards. So, we multiply 6 by 25 to get the total number of basketball cards: 6 × 25 = 150.

Next, we need to find out how many baseball cards she has. She has 5 boxes of baseball cards, and each box has 40 cards. So, we multiply 5 by 40 to get the total number of baseball cards: 5 × 40 = 200.

Now, we add the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards to get the total number of cards: 150 + 200 = 350.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract 50 from 350 to find out how many cards she gives to her students: 350 - 50 = 300.

Since each student gets 10 cards, we divide 300 by 10 to find out how many students she has: 300 ÷ 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's figure out how much more Kelly paid than Becky.

First, we need to find out how much Becky paid for the apples. She bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of apples by the cost per apple.

20 apples * 45 cents/apple = 20 * 45 = 900 cents

Since there's a $1 discount, we need to subtract that from the total cost.

900 cents - 100 cents = 800 cents

Now, let's convert the total cost to dollars.

800 cents / 100 = $8

Next, we need to find out how much Kelly paid. She bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of apples by the cost per apple.

20 apples * 50 cents/apple = 20 * 50 = 1000 cents

Kelly got a 10% discount, which is 10/100 of the total cost. To find 10% of 1000 cents, we multiply 1000 by 0.1.

0.1 * 1000 = 100 cents

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost.

1000 cents - 100 cents = 900 cents

Let's convert the total cost to dollars.

900 cents / 100 = $9

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. We subtract Becky's total cost from Kelly's total cost.

$9 - $8 = $1

The final answer is: $1"
"So, let's figure out how many pieces of laundry there are in 80 rooms. Each room has some stuff that needs to be washed. We need to count how many of each thing there is in one room and then multiply it by the number of rooms.

Each room has 2 sheets, 1 comforter, 4 pillow cases (because there are twice as many pillow cases as sheets), and 8 towels (because there are twice as many towels as pillow cases).

So, let's count the total number of things in one room: 2 (sheets) + 1 (comforter) + 4 (pillow cases) + 8 (towels) = 15 things.

Now, we multiply the number of things in one room by the number of rooms: 15 * 80 = 1200.

The final answer is: 1200"
"Let's figure out how many shoes Fireman Frank has on Sunday.

First, we need to know how many shoes he has at the beginning. He has 200 shoes.

Then, he gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 x 2 = 10 shoes.

Next, he gets 15 new pairs of shoes on Wednesday. That's 15 x 2 = 30 shoes.

Finally, he gets 30 new pairs of shoes on Friday. That's 30 x 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's add up all the shoes he has: 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes.

But then, he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday. So, we need to subtract 180 from 300: 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To figure out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to know how many cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles she has. Each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes, and Mary has 6 jars. So, we multiply 6 jars by 8 cupcakes to get the total number of cupcakes she can decorate.

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Now, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she needs to bake to have at least 48 cupcakes. Each pan holds 12 cupcakes, so we divide 48 by 12 to get the number of pans.

48 ÷ 12 = 4

So, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes."
"Let's figure out how much change Theo got back.

First, we need to find out how much the paper cost. We know the pen cost $2. The paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. So, we multiply 2 by 3 to get 3 times the price of the pen, which is $6. Then, we subtract $1 from that to get the price of the paper, which is $5.

Now, we add the cost of the pen and the paper together. $2 + $5 = $7.

Theo gave the cashier $10, so to find out how much change she got, we subtract the total cost from $10. $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

There are 30 students in Marissa's class, and each student started with 10 pencils. To find the total number of pencils, we multiply the number of students by the number of pencils each student has.

Total pencils initially = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. To find 1/5 of 300, we can multiply 300 by 1/5.

Pencils used = 300 * (1/5) = 300 * 1/5 = 60 pencils

Now, we need to find the remaining pencils after two months. We subtract the pencils used from the total pencils.

Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find 1/3 of 240, we can multiply 240 by 1/3.

Pencils left = 240 * (1/3) = 240/3 = 80 pencils

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's solve the problem. Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, and he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra for cleaning his room. We can write this as an equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to get rid of the 2 on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Now, we need to get rid of the 1/2 on the left side. We can do this by multiplying both sides by 2:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we need to know the length of the shark and the remoras. The shark is 10 feet long, and the remoras are 6 inches long. We need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet.

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing 6 by 12. 

6 ÷ 12 = 0.5 feet

There are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 x 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiplying by 100.

(1 ÷ 10) x 100 = 10%

So, the remoras occupy 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is: 10"
"So, we have a problem here. We know that 3 out of 4 students have a desktop computer at home. That means 1 out of 4 students don't have one. We're told that 20 students don't have a desktop computer. Since 1 out of 4 students is equal to 20, we can set up an equation to find the total number of students.

Let's call the total number of students 'x'. Since 1 out of 4 students is equal to 20, we can write the equation as:

(1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4. This will cancel out the 1/4 on the left side.

4 * (1/4)x = 4 * 20
x = 80

So, there are 80 students in total at that grade level.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many days Jason has to walk in total, we need to multiply the number of weeks by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, we need to divide the total number of days by 4.

21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4

"Let's figure out how many books each of Sarah's kids got.

First, we need to find out how many books Sarah bought in total. We know she spent $300 and each book costs $15.

To find the total number of books, we divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book:

Total number of books = $300 ÷ $15
Total number of books = 20

Now, we know Sarah has 4 kids and she wants to give an equal number of books to each of them. To find out how many books each kid gets, we divide the total number of books by 4:

Number of books each child got = 20 ÷ 4
Number of books each child got = 5

So, each of Sarah's kids got 5 books."
"Let's figure out how many kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything. We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both.

To find the total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts, we need to add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number allergic to peanuts, then subtract the number allergic to both. This is because we don't want to count the kids allergic to both twice.

9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) - 3 (both) = 12

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything:
32 (total kids) - 12 (allergic kids) = 20

So, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is 20."
"So, let's figure out how many people are going on the tour. We know there are 3 groups of employees, and each group has 200 people. To find the total number of employees, we multiply the number of groups by the number of people in each group: 3 x 200 = 600.

Now, we need to add the number of tour guides. There are 3 groups, and each group has 7 tour guides. So, we multiply the number of groups by the number of tour guides: 3 x 7 = 21.

To find the total number of people going on the tour, we add the number of employees and the number of tour guides: 600 + 21 = 621.

The final answer is: 621"
"Let's break down the cost of Tom's anniversary getaway.

First, we need to find the cost of the plane tickets. Since there are two people, and each ticket costs $5000, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

Next, we need to find the cost of the hotel. The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day, but it's 20% more expensive because it's a busy weekend. To find the new price, we multiply the normal price by 1.2 (which is the same as 100% + 20%). So, the new price is $1500 x 1.2 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is $1800 x 3 = $5400.

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip. $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"
"Let's figure out how many tubes of paint Jasper has.

Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben. Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper also has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has in total, we need to add the number of blue and yellow tubes. 2 + 9 = 11.

"Let's figure out the combined weight of Belen's two pennies. We know that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. 

To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we need to find three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. To do this, we multiply 48 by 3 and then divide by 4.

48 * 3 = 144
144 ÷ 4 = 36

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Now, we need to add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny to find the combined weight.

36 + 48 = 84

The combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains.

The final answer is: 84"

"Let's figure out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his.

Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so Luri has 3 x 20 = 60 songs.

Since the player can store up to 100 songs, Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs to his player. Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs to his player.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add, we need to subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add. So, 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's figure out how much money Stetson gave up. 

First, we need to find out how many oranges Stetson ate. They picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and then divide by 5.

60 * 2 = 120
120 ÷ 5 = 24

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Now, we need to find out how much money he gave up. He gave up $10 for each orange he ate. To find the total amount of money, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange.

24 * $10 = $240

"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to know how many miles he runs in a week and how fast he runs.

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. To find the total miles he runs in a week, we multiply the miles he runs each day by the number of days he runs.

Miles run in a week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
= 12 * 5
= 60 miles/week

Now, we need to find out how many hours James runs in a week. We know he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find the total hours he runs in a week, we divide the total miles run in a week by his speed.

Hours run in a week = Total miles run in a week / Speed
= 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour

"Let's figure out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs for his horses.

First, we need to know how much oats each horse eats in a day. Since each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal and Uncle Ben feeds them twice a day, we multiply 5 pounds by 2 to get 10 pounds per day.

Now, we have 4 horses, so we multiply 10 pounds by 4 to get the total amount of oats they eat in a day: 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Since Uncle Ben needs oats for 5 days, we multiply 40 pounds by 5 to get the total amount of oats needed: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Each bag of oats has 50 pounds, so we need to divide 200 pounds by 50 to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs: 200 ÷ 50 = 4.

"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the remaining amount first. 

The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4. So, the remaining amount is:

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find out how many days it will take to save the remaining amount. The child promises to save $2 daily from his allowance.

Days to save the remaining amount = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Days to save the remaining amount = $8 / $2

"Heather wants to buy 2 packs of razors. Each pack has 4 razors and costs $4.00. Right now, they're on sale, so she can buy one pack and get one free. She also has a $2.00 coupon.

First, we need to find out how much Heather will pay for 2 packs of razors. Since it's buy one get one free, she only pays for 1 pack, which is $4.00. Then, she gets a $2.00 discount with her coupon. So, she pays $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00 for 2 packs of razors.

Now, we need to find out how many razors she gets in total. Each pack has 4 razors, and she buys 2 packs, so she gets 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find out how much each razor costs, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors. The total cost is $2.00, and the number of razors is 8. So, the cost of each razor is $2.00 ÷ 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100. $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

"So, Charisma works 8 hours a day and she gets up to walk for 5 minutes every hour. To find out how many minutes she walks in a day, we multiply the number of hours she works by the number of minutes she walks each hour. That's 8 hours * 5 minutes = 40 minutes.

Since she works for 5 days, we multiply the minutes she walks in a day by the number of days she worked. That's 40 minutes * 5 days = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out how old Angela will be in four years. We know that in four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. Since Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, we multiply Brett's current age by 3. So, 3 * 14 = 42. This means Angela will be 42 years old in four years.

Now, we need to find out how old Angela is now. To do this, we subtract 4 from 42, because we want to know her age before the 4 years. So, 42 - 4 = 38.

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old."

The morning rides cost $6 each, and the afternoon rides cost $2 each. To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides.

First, let's find the cost of the morning rides: 14 days * $6 per day = $84.

Next, let's find the cost of the afternoon rides: 14 days * $2 per day = $28.

Now, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides: $84 + $28 = $112.

So, Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during those two weeks.

The final answer is: $112"
"Let's figure out how many Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box. To find out how many oranges she has, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges in each box: 5 x 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley. So, we add 20 to the number of oranges Ashley has: 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

Now, we need to find the total number of oranges they have together. We add Ashley's oranges to Brianne's oranges: 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

"Let's figure out how many guests Mark needs for the two party venues to be the same price.

The first venue costs a flat $200, plus $5 for each guest. So, the total cost for this venue is $200 + $5x, where x is the number of guests.

The second venue costs $25 for each guest, and it already includes food, so we don't need to add anything extra.

To find out when the two venues are the same price, we need to set up an equation. We'll set the cost of the first venue equal to the cost of the second venue:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we'll get rid of the 5x on the left side by subtracting 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Next, we'll divide both sides by 20 to find the value of x:

x = 200 ÷ 20
x = 10

So, Mark needs 10 guests for the two venues to be the same price.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's solve the problem together. We know that Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects in total. We also know that Lily found 7 more insects than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's say Bodhi found B insects. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects. And since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

We can write an equation to represent the total number of insects they found: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: B + B = 2B, and 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the equation becomes: 2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

First, let's find out how many yards Mariah used. She used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we can multiply 364 by 1/4 to find out how many yards Mariah used.

364 ÷ 4 = 91 yards

Now, let's find out how many yards her grandma used. She used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. We can multiply 364 by 1/2 to find out how many yards her grandma used.

364 ÷ 2 = 182 yards

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together.

91 + 182 = 273 yards

"Let's figure out how much each pack of strawberry gum costs.

Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. 2 of them are strawberry gum, 1 is grape gum that costs $2, and 1 is green apple gum that costs half as much as the grape gum. Since half of $2 is $1, the green apple gum costs $1.

The total cost of all the gum is $7. We can make an equation to solve for the cost of each strawberry pack. Let's call the cost of each strawberry pack 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x.

The total cost of the grape gum is $2, and the total cost of the green apple gum is $1. So, the total cost of all the gum is 2x + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2x.

Since the total cost is $7, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x = 7.

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, 2x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2, x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to figure out which type of wood gives him the most sticks for his money. We know that a 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and gives 200 sticks, and a 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and gives 400 sticks.

To find out how many sticks we get per dollar, we can divide the number of sticks by the cost. For the 2 x 4, that's 200 sticks / $4 = 50 sticks per dollar. For the 2 x 8, that's 400 sticks / $6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar.

Since 66.67 is more than 50, the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives the most sticks per dollar. Now, let's see how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24. We can do this by dividing $24 by $6, which is 24 ÷ 6 = 4.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces of wood will give 4 x 400 = 1600 sticks.

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to know how many snowshoes he needs to buy. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, we multiply the number of dogs by the number of legs each dog has. That's 6 x 4 = 24 legs.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the total number of snowshoes. So, 24 / 2 = 12 snowshoes.

Now, we need to find the total cost. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. That's 12 x $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"

"Let's figure out how many animals the farm and the zoo have combined.

The farm has 30 cows. The zoo has 20 sheep. We also know that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. So, the zoo has 2 x 30 = 60 cows.

Now, let's think about the sheep. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

To find the total number of animals at the farm, we add the number of cows and sheep: 30 + 10 = 40.

To find the total number of animals at the zoo, we add the number of cows and sheep: 60 + 20 = 80.

Now, let's add the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120.

We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. We also know that she bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. 

Let's say Sophia bought x onions and y potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can write the equation as:
x + y = 4(x + y)

We can simplify this equation by multiplying 4 to the terms inside the parentheses:
x + y = 4x + 4y

Now, let's use the information that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. We can write the equation as:
x + y = 4x + 4y
12 + 4 = 4x + 4y

Combine the numbers on the left side of the equation:
16 = 4x + 4y

Now, let's divide both sides of the equation by 4:
4 = x + y

Since we know that x + y = 4, we can set up the equation as:
x + y = 4

We also know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since she bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can say that the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 1/4 of what Rose bought.

The total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. So, Sophia bought 1/4 of 16, which is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To lose 30 pounds, Andy needs to burn 30 * 3500 calories, which is 105,000 calories. 

To find out how many calories he needs to burn each day, we need to know how many days he has until his birthday. December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (since it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Now, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 
105,000 / 171 ≈ 613.5 calories per day.

The final answer is: 614"
"So Gerald works at a daycare and he gets paid $30 every day. He worked for a whole week, which is 7 days. To find out how much he earned, we multiply the amount he gets paid per day by the number of days he worked.

$30/day * 7 days = $210

Now, we know Gerald spent $100. To find out how much he has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he earned.

$210 - $100 = $110

So Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we need to know how far she's going to run and how much water she needs to drink per kilometer. 

First, let's figure out how far she'll run. If she runs 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km, we can multiply the number of laps by the distance of each lap:

8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now, we know Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. So, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water she needs to drink per kilometer:

2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

Hannah needs to drink 120 ml of water."
"Let's figure out how much money Julie has left.

First, Julie had $500. She spent 20% of it on clothes. To find 20% of $500, we multiply 0.2 by 500. That's 0.2 x 500 = $100. So, she spent $100 on clothes.

Now, we need to find out how much money she has left after buying clothes. We subtract the money she spent from the initial amount: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs. To find 25% of $400, we multiply 0.25 by 400. That's 0.25 x 400 = $100. So, she spent $100 on CDs.

Now, we need to find out how much money she has left after buying CDs. We subtract the money she spent from the remaining amount: $400 - $100 = $300.

So, Julie has $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's solve this problem. We know that the house and the lot together cost $120,000. We also know that the house costs three times as much as the lot.

Let's say the lot costs x dollars. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the house costs 3x dollars.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

We can combine like terms by adding x and 3x, which gives us 4x = 120,000.

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4. This gives us x = 120,000 ÷ 4 = 30,000.

Since the house costs 3x, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying 3 and 30,000, which is 3 × 30,000 = 90,000.

So, the house cost $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"Let's figure out how much profit Tara made from selling her canvas bags.

First, we need to find out how much money Tara spent to buy the bags. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. To find the total number of bags, we multiply the number of packs by the number of bags in each pack: 8 packs * 5 bags/pack = 40 bags.

Now, we multiply the total number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost: 40 bags * $4/bag = $160.

Next, we need to find out how much money Tara made from selling the bags. She sold each bag for $8, so we multiply the total number of bags by the selling price: 40 bags * $8/bag = $320.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $320 - $160 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To find out how many punches Joe threw, we need to know how many minutes he was fighting and how many punches he throws per minute. 

The fight is 5 rounds long, and each round is 3 minutes. So, we multiply 5 rounds by 3 minutes to get the total time: 5 x 3 = 15 minutes.

Now, we know Joe throws 25 punches per minute. To find the total number of punches, we multiply the total time by the number of punches he throws per minute: 15 x 25 = 375.

The final answer is: 375"
"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to figure out how many Josh made first. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we divide 36 by 4 to find out how many Josh made. 

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So Josh made 9 cookies. Now, we need to find out how many Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so we multiply the number of cookies Josh made by 2.

9 × 2 = 18

Kelsie made 18 cookies.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. We need to find out how much money he has in total.

First, we calculate the money from the $10 bills: 4 x $10 = $40
Then, we calculate the money from the $20 bills: 6 x $20 = $120
Now, we add the money from both: $40 + $120 = $160

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. So, he has $80 left.

Next, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of $80, we multiply $80 by 3 and then divide by 5: (3/5) × $80 = ($80 × 3) / 5 = $240 / 5 = $48

Now, we subtract the money Ali spent on dinner from the remaining money: $80 - $48 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"Let's figure out how long it takes Royce to shingle a house. We know that Rob takes 2 hours to do it, and we need to convert that to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes.

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we need to find double the time it takes Rob, which is 2 x 120 = 240 minutes. Then, we add 40 minutes to that, which is 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

So, it takes Royce 280 minutes to shingle a house.

The final answer is: 280"
"To find out how many skeins of wool Martha needs, we need to add up the number of skeins for each item she wants to make for her grandchildren.

First, let's count the skeins for each item:

- Hats: 3 kids * 2 skeins per hat = 3 x 2 = 6 skeins
- Scarves: 3 kids * 4 skeins per scarf = 3 x 4 = 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 3 kids * 12 skeins per sweater = 3 x 12 = 36 skeins
- Mittens: 3 kids * 1 skein per pair = 3 x 1 = 3 skeins
- Socks: 3 kids * 2 skeins per pair = 3 x 2 = 6 skeins

Now, let's add up all the skeins: 6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = ?

To add these numbers, we can start with 6 + 12 = 18, then 18 + 36 = 54, then 54 + 3 = 57, and finally 57 + 6 = 63.

The final answer is: 63"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Chris has 100 math problems to complete. On Monday, he finished 12 problems. That's a good start.

On Tuesday, he did 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. To find out how many problems he did on Tuesday, we multiply 12 by 3. That's 12 × 3 = 36 problems.

So, by Tuesday, Chris has completed 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

Now, we need to find out how many problems are left. We subtract the problems he's already done from the total number of problems. That's 100 - 48 = 52 problems left.

On Wednesday, Chris did one-quarter of the remaining problems. To find one-quarter, we divide 52 by 4. That's 52 ÷ 4 = 13 problems.

So, by Wednesday, Chris has completed 48 + 13 = 61 problems.

Now, we subtract the problems he's done from the total number of problems to find out how many are left. That's 100 - 61 = 39 problems.

The final answer is: 39"
"Let's figure out how many quarts of strawberries Tony, Bobby, Kathy, and Ricky can pick per hour.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour. That's a lot!

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony. So, Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby. That means Kathy can pick 2 x 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy. So, Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, let's add up how many quarts each of them can pick per hour: 6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

"To find out how many loaves of bread are left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold and the number of loaves returned from the total number of loaves baked.

First, let's add the number of loaves sold in the morning and the afternoon. 
93 + 39 = 132

Now, we need to subtract the total number of loaves sold and the number of loaves returned from the total number of loaves baked.
200 - 132 - 6 = 62

So, the number of loaves of bread left is 62."
"Jackson is planting tulips. He can fit 6 red tulips in a row and 8 blue tulips in a row. If Jackson buys 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips, how many rows of flowers will he plant?

To find the number of rows of red tulips, we need to divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row. 

36 ÷ 6 = 6

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we need to divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

24 ÷ 8 = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips. 

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of cookies.

Heather has 27 cups of raisins in total. She wants to divide the raisins equally among the oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. So, each of them will get 27 ÷ 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Now, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies. We subtract the raisins used for the granola and snack mix from the total number of raisins: 27 - 9 = 18 cups of raisins.

A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the number of cups of raisins left for the oatmeal cookies by 3/4.

To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. So, 18 ÷ (3/4) = 18 × (4/3) = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then multiply it by the cost per kilowatt hour.

First, let's find out how much Ada uses electricity in a day and a week before adding the new device. She uses 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 12 by 7 to get the total kilowatts used in a week.

12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatts per week

Now, we need to find out how much it costs. Since each kilowatt hour costs $1.50, we multiply 84 by $1.50.

84 kilowatts per week * $1.50 = $126 per week

Next, let's find out how much Ada will use in a week after adding the new device. The new device uses 2 kilowatts per hour, so we add that to her original 12 kilowatts per hour.

12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour

Now, we multiply 14 by 7 to get the total kilowatts used in a week.

14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatts per week

Now, we multiply 98 by $1.50 to find out how much it costs.

98 kilowatts per week * $1.50 = $147 per week

To find the difference, we subtract the original cost from the new cost.

$147 per week - $126 per week = $21 per week

The final answer is: $21"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

First, let's think about how long it takes for one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house (because 2 * 5 = 10).

Now, if 5 people can paint a whole house in 10 days, we need to find out how many hours that is. There are 24 hours in a day, so we multiply 10 days by 24 hours to get the total number of hours.

10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

So, it would take 5 people 240 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's figure out how many sofas and chairs Ophelia and Jenna have.

We know that Ophelia has 20 sofas. We also know that she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, to find out how many chairs she has, we add 2 to the number of sofas she has. That's 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Now, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Since Ophelia has 22 chairs, Jenna has 3 x 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we subtract 2 from the number of chairs she has to find out how many sofas she has. That's 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's count the total number of sofas and chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture. Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.

The total number of sofas and chairs is 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: 172"
"Let's figure out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't get the headphone set.

First, we need to know how much money Tom spent on the headphone set. We know he spent a total of $48 and the CD cost $4. So, the money he spent on the headphone set is:

$48 (total) - $4 (CD) = $44

Now, let's find out how many CDs he could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set. We know each CD costs $4, so:

$44 ÷ $4 = 11 CDs

If Tom didn't get the headphone set, he would have had $44 to spend on CDs. We already know he could buy 11 CDs with that money. But we also know he could buy 12 CDs with the total $48 he had. So, to find out how many more CDs he could have bought without the headphone set, we subtract the number of CDs he could buy with the total money from the number of CDs he could buy with the money he spent on the headphone set:

11 (CDs with $44) - 1 (CD he already bought) = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's figure out how many hours Josh spent working out. We know he worked out 4 hours a week for most of the time, but there were some weeks where he worked out more.

There are 8 weeks in total. Josh worked out 4 hours a week for 6 of those weeks. So, we multiply 6 weeks by 4 hours to get the total hours for those weeks: 6 x 4 = 24 hours.

Then, there were 2 weeks where Josh worked out 5 hours each. We multiply 2 weeks by 5 hours to get the total hours for those weeks: 2 x 5 = 10 hours.

Lastly, there was 1 week where Josh worked out 6 hours. We multiply 1 week by 6 hours to get the total hours for that week: 1 x 6 = 6 hours.

Now, we add up all the hours: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's figure out how many people are on the bus after the second stop.

First, we start with 48 people on the bus. At the first stop, 8 people get off. To find out how many people are left, we subtract 8 from 48:

48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as got off (8) get on the bus. That's 5 x 8 = 40 people. So, we add 40 to 40:

40 + 40 = 80

Now, at the second stop, 21 people get off. We subtract 21 from 80:

80 - 21 = 59

Next, 3 times fewer people get on the bus. This means 3 x 21 = 63 fewer people get on. But since you can't have a negative number of people, it means 63 more people get on. So, we add 63 to 59:

59 + 63 = 122

The final answer is: 122"
"Let's figure out how many years separate Jame's age from his cousin's age.

We know that Jame will be 27 in 5 years. That means he's 27 - 5 = 22 years old now.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Let's break it down:

1. Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
2. Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 x 30 = 60 years.
3. So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.

Now, we need to find Jame's cousin's current age. Since he'll be 55 in 8 years, we subtract 8 from 55 to get his current age: 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, let's find the difference between Jame's age and his cousin's age:
   Difference = Jame's age - cousin's age
             = 22 - 47
             = -25

Since age can't be negative, we take the absolute value of the difference:
   Difference = | -25 |
             = 25

So, the difference between Jame's age and his cousin's age is 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's figure out how much one monitor costs.

We know that Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400. The computer cost $1,100. We also know that the printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, let's find out how much the printer cost. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:
Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
= $1,100 - $400
= $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer, which is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. To find the cost of the 2 monitors, we subtract this amount from the total cost:
Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer and printer
= $2,400 - $1,800
= $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we need to find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the monitors by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
= $600 / 2
= $300

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are 20 kids in total, and they were divided into two equal groups of boys and girls. Since there are 20 kids, we can divide them into two groups of 10 kids each.

The boys went out for the scavenger hunt and brought back 60 shells each. To find the total number of shells brought by the boys, we multiply the number of boys by the number of shells each boy brought: 10 x 60 = 600.

Now, we need to find out how many shells the girls brought. We know that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 60 (the number of shells the boys brought) + 4 x 60 (four times the number of shells the boys brought) = 60 + 240 = 300 more shells than the boys.

So, the total number of shells brought by the girls is 600 (the number of shells the boys brought) + 300 (the extra shells the girls brought) = 900.

Since there are 10 girls, we can find the number of shells each girl brought by dividing the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls: 900 ÷ 10 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we know that Nick had twice as many candies as George. If we say George had x candies, then Nick had 2x candies.

Then, George ate 5 candies. So, George has x - 5 candies left.

We are told that George has 3 candies left, so we can write an equation: x - 5 = 3.

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: x = 3 + 5, which is x = 8.

Now that we know George had 8 candies, we can find out how many candies Nick had. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x = 2(8) = 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we need to find Alyana's age first. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, we subtract 4 from Chenny's age to get Alyana's age.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we need to find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we add 2 to Alyana's age to get Anne's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to know how thick each book is. 

The first book is 31 mm thick. 
The second book is 50 mm thick. 
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick. 
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together: 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

To find out how many vlogs she has made so far, we need to add those numbers together: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Now, we need to subtract the number of vlogs she has made from the total number of vlogs she wants to make: 72 - 54 = 18

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is: 18"
"So, my wife and I went out to dinner and the bill was $50. She said she wanted to split it, but she also wanted me to pay an extra 20% as a tip. To find out how much I paid, I need to calculate the tip first.

To find 20% of $50, I multiply $50 by 0.20. That's like finding 20% of a number, which is the same as moving the decimal point two places to the left and then dividing by 5.

$50 × 0.20 = $10

Now, I add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount I paid.

$50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

So, I paid $60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy got. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3. 

$18 ÷ 3 = $6

So, the eldest boy got $6. 

Next, he added $5 to his share, so he had $6 + $5 = $11.

Then, he added another $10, so he had $11 + $10 = $21.

After that, he spent $8, so he had $21 - $8 = $13.

Finally, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8, so he had $13 × 3 = $39.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Elvis wants to save $1125 in a month. He wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month as he saves in the first half. We need to find out how much he has to save each day in the second half.

Let's say there are x days in the first half of the month. Since April has 30 days, the second half will also have x days. 

The total number of days in April is 30, so x + x = 30. This means 2x = 30, and x = 15.

Now, let's say Elvis saves y dollars each day in the first half. Then, he will save 2y dollars each day in the second half. The total amount saved in the first half is xy, and the total amount saved in the second half is 2xy.

The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is xy + 2xy = 3xy. We know this total is $1125, so we can write the equation 3xy = 1125.

We already know x = 15, so we can substitute this into the equation: 3(15)y = 1125. This simplifies to 45y = 1125.

To find y, we divide both sides by 45: y = 1125 / 45 = 25.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the amount saved in the second half is 2y = 2(25) = 50.

So, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month.

The final answer is: $50"
"Let's figure out how much change Verna got back.

First, we need to find the total cost of the fruits. We have three apples that cost $1.50 each, five oranges that cost $0.80 each, and six peaches that cost $0.75 each.

To find the total cost of the apples, we multiply the number of apples by the cost of each apple: 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we find the total cost of the oranges by multiplying the number of oranges by the cost of each orange: 5 x $0.80 = $4.

Then, we find the total cost of the peaches by multiplying the number of peaches by the cost of each peach: 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, we add the costs of all the fruits together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, we need to find the change she got back. To do this, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from $20: $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"Let's figure out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and he finished 20 tasks. To find his total, we multiply the amount he gets per task by the number of tasks he finished.

Jairus' total = 0.8 * 20 = $16

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she finished 20 tasks. To find her total, we multiply the amount she gets per task by the number of tasks she finished.

Jenny's total = 0.5 * 20 = $10

Now, we need to find the difference between Jairus' total and Jenny's total.

Difference = Jairus' total - Jenny's total = 16 - 10 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars. So, the sum of what Jeff and Brad get is 100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

So, Jeff gets $80."
"To find out how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to know how far he walks each day and then multiply that by the number of days he works.

Jeff walks to work and back home, so he walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home, which is a total of 3 + 3 = 6 miles per day.

Since Jeff works 5 days a week, we multiply the miles he walks each day by 5: 6 miles/day * 5 days = 30 miles.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many letters Elise has written, we need to break it down step by step.

First, Elise writes the alphabet twice. There are 26 letters in the alphabet, so that's 26 x 2 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

Then, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes the 52 letters she wrote twice, and the 13 letters she wrote half of the alphabet. So, that's 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Now, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. So, the total number of letters she has written is 65 + 65 = 130.

The final answer is: 130"
"So, let's figure out how many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls. 

Imagine Ali calls 3 families first. Then each of those 3 families calls 3 other families. That's like a tree branching out. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 families. 
In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so that's 9 x 3 = 27 families. 
In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so that's 27 x 3 = 81 families.

The final answer is: 81"
"Let's figure out Mark's initial weight. We know he lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months. To find the total weight he lost, we multiply the weight he lost per month by the number of months:

10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we need to add the weight he lost to his final weight to find his initial weight. His final weight is 70 pounds, so we add 30 pounds to that:

Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's figure out how many toys Jonathan has. We know that James has 80 toys in his play set, and Jonathan needs to have 5 times as many toys as James to make a sorted play set. 

First, we need to find out how many toys are in the larger play set. To do this, we multiply the number of toys James has by 5.

80 × 5 = 400

Now, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. Let's call the number of toys Jonathan currently has ""x"". We can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The final answer is: 398"
"Let's figure out how much Daniel has to spend on all the items he wants to buy.

First, we need to find the cost of each item. 

- 5 notebooks at $1.50 each: 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
- 2 pens at $0.25 each: 2 x $0.25 = $0.50
- 1 calculator at $12 each: 1 x $12 = $12
- 1 geometry set at $10 each: 1 x $10 = $10

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. To find 10% of $30, we multiply $30 by 0.1: 0.1 x $30 = $3.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $30 - $3 = $27.

So, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

The final answer is: $27"
"Let's figure out how much change Carly gets back. She buys 5 hamburgers for $4 each, 10 packs of potato fries for $0.30 each, and 5 cans of fruit drinks for $2 each.

First, we need to find the total cost of the hamburgers: 5 x $4 = $20

Next, we find the total cost of the potato fries: 10 x $0.30 = $3

Then, we find the total cost of the fruit drinks: 5 x $2 = $10

Now, we add all the costs together: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

Carly pays with a $50 bill. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill: $50 - $33 = $17

The final answer is: $17"
"Let's break down how much money Antonella earned. 

First, we need to find out how much commission she gets for selling $1000 worth of goods. To do this, we multiply $1000 by 30% (which is the same as 0.3). 

$1000 x 0.3 = $300

Now, we need to find out how much commission she gets for selling the rest of the goods. We subtract $1000 from $2500 to get the amount of goods sold over $1000. 

$2500 - $1000 = $1500

Then, we multiply $1500 by 10% (which is the same as 0.1) to find the commission for the goods sold over $1000.

$1500 x 0.1 = $150

Now, we add the commission for the first $1000 and the commission for the goods sold over $1000 to find the total commission.

$300 + $150 = $450

The total amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"Let's figure out how many water bottles Bill needs for his party. He has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, he already has 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

Now, we need to find out how many bottles he needs for his guests. He has 70 guests, and he wants 2 bottles for each guest. To find the total number of bottles he needs for his guests, we multiply the number of guests by the number of bottles per guest: 70 x 2 = 140.

To find out how many bottles he needs in total, we add the number of bottles he already has to the number of bottles he needs for his guests: 140 + 48 = 188.

Since Bill already has 48 bottles, he needs to buy 188 - 48 = 140 more bottles.

The final answer is: 140"
"Let's figure out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile on a hot day. We know that when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. 

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Twice that time is 2 x 16 = 32 minutes. Then, we add 2 minutes to that, so 32 + 2 = 34 minutes. That's how long it takes Ray to swim a mile on a hot day.

Now, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day. 

Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day = 3 x 16 = 48 minutes
Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day = 3 x 34 = 102 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes to swim 3 miles on a cold day from the time it takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day.

Difference in time = Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day - Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day
= 102 - 48
= 54 minutes

"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to know how much money he makes in a week. 

John gets paid $2 per hour and he works 5 hours a day. So, his daily earnings are $2 x 5 = $10.

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are $10 x 4 = $40.

Now, we need to divide the amount he wants to save ($80) by his weekly earnings ($40) to find out how many weeks it will take him to save that much money.

$80 ÷ $40 = 2

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

"Let's solve the problem. We have a bag of buttons with 21 buttons in total. Some of the buttons have 2 holes and the rest have 4 holes. We need to find the total number of holes in all the buttons.

First, we need to find out how many buttons have 2 holes and how many have 4 holes. Since 7 buttons have 2 holes, that means the rest of the buttons have 4 holes. To find the number of buttons with 4 holes, we subtract the number of buttons with 2 holes from the total number of buttons:

21 (total buttons) - 7 (buttons with 2 holes) = 14 buttons with 4 holes

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes: 7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes

Next, let's calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes: 14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 56 holes

To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we add the number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes: 14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes

"Let's figure out how many cups of coffee Juan needs to reduce his daily intake.

We know that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. Let's say the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. So, Octavia drinks 4/2 = 2 cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Since Octavia drinks 2 cups, Juan drinks 10 * 2 = 20 cups of coffee.

Now, Juan's doctor wants him to drink only 4 cups of coffee a day. To find out how many cups he needs to reduce, we need to subtract the recommended amount from the amount he currently drinks:

20 (current amount) - 4 (recommended amount) = 16 cups

So, Juan needs to reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"Let's count the number of rodents in the pet shop. We have 3 cages with hamsters and 3 cages with guinea pigs.

To find the total number of hamsters, we multiply the number of cages with hamsters by the number of hamsters in each cage: 3 x 10 = 30 hamsters.

To find the total number of guinea pigs, we multiply the number of cages with guinea pigs by the number of guinea pigs in each cage: 3 x 5 = 15 guinea pigs.

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents: 30 + 15 = 45 rodents.

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we need to know their weights. Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we need to add up their weights to find the total weight. The total weight is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by 3. The average weight is 540 ÷ 3 = 180 pounds.

The final answer is: 180"
"So, let's figure out how many degrees the sun will be from the ground after it moves for 10 hours. We know the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. The sun moves 5 degrees every hour straight upward.

To find the final angle, we need to add the initial angle of the pyramid to the angle the sun moves in 10 hours. We can do this by multiplying the angle the sun moves per hour (5 degrees) by the number of hours it moves (10 hours).

Angle moved by the sun = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours
= 5 * 10
= 50 degrees

Now, we add the initial angle of the pyramid to the angle the sun moved:
Final angle = Initial angle + Angle moved by the sun
= 32 degrees + 50 degrees
= 82 degrees

"To find out how much James spends on candles, we need to know how many candles he needs and how much they cost. 

First, we need to figure out how many candles James needs. Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 8 years old. We know that each son needs a candle for each year of their age. So, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Now, we need to find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy. A pack of candles has 5 candles, so we need to divide the total number of candles by 5.

20 ÷ 5 = 4

Since James needs 4 packs of candles, and each pack costs $3, we can multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to find the total cost.

4 packs * $3 per pack = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to figure out how many pages she read in the first week and then add that to the 100 pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

We know Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 ÷ 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, in two weeks, Judy read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"Let's solve the problem. 

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old. 

In 7 years, his nephew will be x + 7 years old. 

The problem says that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can write an equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: 51 ÷ 3 = x + 7.

This simplifies to 17 = x + 7. 

Now, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 17 - 7 = x.

This simplifies to x = 10.

"So, let's figure out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon. 

The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth. 

Then, for the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, so that's 3 x $1.00 = $3.00.

Now, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth. That's $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left 2 x $0.50 = $1.00.

To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left, we need to add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

"Let's figure out how many goals the three teenagers scored in total.

We know that Richie scored 80 goals. We also know that he scored 20 more goals than Mark, and 45 more goals than Anna.

Let's find out how many goals Mark scored. Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can subtract 20 from Richie's goals to find Mark's goals.

Mark's goals = Richie's goals - 20
Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

Now, let's find out how many goals Anna scored. Since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can subtract 45 from Richie's goals to find Anna's goals.

Anna's goals = Richie's goals - 45
Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now that we know how many goals each of them scored, we can add them up to find the total number of goals.

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam."
"Let's figure out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week.

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. He spent $5 each day on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. That's 4 days, so he spent a total of 4 x $5 = $20 on wooden action figures. Since he spent $20, he bought 20 ÷ 5 = 4 wooden action figures.

Now, let's see how many plastic action figures he can buy. He has $70 - $20 = $50 left. He has 5 days left, and each plastic action figure costs $2. So, he can buy 50 ÷ 2 = 25 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 4 + 25 = 29.

"Let's figure out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month.

First, we need to find out how many roses the flower shops order in a week. There are three shops, and they order 20, 15, and 30 roses per week. To find the total number of roses ordered per week, we add these numbers together:

20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses ordered per week by 4 to find the total number of roses ordered per month:

65 roses/week × 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, we need to find out how many roses Ford grows per month. He grows 40 roses per week, so we multiply this number by 4 to find the total number of roses he grows per month:

40 roses/week × 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the number of roses he grows per month from the number of roses ordered per month:

260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

"Let's figure out how much money Katina will have left in her savings account after 2 years.

First, we need to know how much money she takes out each month. She takes out $100 every month. 

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

To find out how much money she takes out in 2 years, we multiply the amount she takes out each month by the number of months: $100 x 24 = $2400.

Now, we need to subtract the amount she took out from the initial amount in her account. The initial amount is $3000. So, $3000 - $2400 = $600.

"To find the net profit of the food truck, we need to know how much they spend and how much they make.

First, let's find out how much they spend. They buy bread for $3.00 a loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread. They also spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches.

Total cost = cost of bread + cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

Now, let's find out how much they make. They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.

Total revenue = number of sandwiches * price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

"To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the area of the room and the cost of the materials and labor.

First, we need to find the area of the room. The room is 18 feet by 12 feet, so we multiply the length by the width to get the area: 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

Now, let's find the cost of the new carpet. The carpet costs $12 per square foot, so we multiply the area by the cost per square foot: 216 * $12 = $2592.

Next, we need to find the cost of the padding. The padding costs $2 per square foot, so we multiply the area by the cost per square foot: 216 * $2 = $432.

Then, we need to find the cost of removing the old carpet. The contractor charges $4 per square foot, so we multiply the area by the cost per square foot: 216 * $4 = $864.

After that, we need to find the cost of installing the new carpet. The contractor charges $34 per square foot, so we multiply the area by the cost per square foot: 216 * $34 = $7344.

Now, we add up the cost of the materials: $2592 (carpet) + $432 (padding) = $3024. Then, we add the cost of removing the old carpet: $3024 + $864 = $3888.

First, we need to know how many cards the boy has. He has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he does, so we need to subtract 3 from 5 to find out how many cards his brother has. 

5 - 3 = 2

So, his brother has 2 cards. Now, we need to add the number of cards the boy and his brother have together to find the total number of cards they have.

5 + 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"Maggie's oven is broken. When she sets it to 450, it actually gets to 468. This means it's off by 18 degrees. To find out how much it's off, we need to divide 18 by 450.

18 ÷ 450 = 0.04

This means the oven is off by 4%. Now, we need to find out what temperature Maggie should set the oven to if her recipe calls for 520 degrees. To do this, we need to find 4% of 520.

4% of 520 is 0.04 x 520 = 20.8

Now, we need to subtract 20.8 from 520 to find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to.

520 - 20.8 = 499.2

Since we can't set the oven to a fraction of a degree, we round to the nearest whole number. So, Maggie should set the oven to 499.

The final answer is: 499"
"To find out how many minutes Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the time of each movie together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. We can convert 1 hour to minutes by multiplying 1 by 60, which is 60 minutes. Then we add 30 minutes to that, so 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for the first movie.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert 2 hours to minutes by multiplying 2 by 60, which is 120 minutes. Then we add 5 minutes to that, so 120 + 5 = 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we add the time for both movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"So, Juan asked his neighbor Herb how much his house was worth, and Herb said he paid $76,000 for it. Now, Juan wants to know how much his own house is worth. He knows that his house is 30% less expensive than Herb's.

To find out how much Juan's house is worth, we need to find 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. To find 30% of a number, we multiply it by 0.3. So, 30% of $76,000 is 0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800.

Now, we subtract $22,800 from $76,000 to find Juan's house price. $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

To find the combined value of the two houses, we add Herb's house price and Juan's house price together. $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

The final answer is: $129,200"
"Let's figure out the total number of utensils Judy and her friend brought to the charity event.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 x 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's add up the total number of cups and dishes Judy brought: 
Judy's cups: 12
Judy's dishes: 24
Total Judy brought: 12 + 24 = 36

Now, let's add up the total number of cups and dishes her friend brought: 
Friend's cups: 40
Friend's dishes: 44
Total friend brought: 40 + 44 = 84

Now, let's add the total number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend: 
Total Judy brought: 36
Total friend brought: 84
Total brought by both: 36 + 84 = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's figure out how much each pair of contacts will cost.

First, we need to know how many pairs of contacts Pete will have. Since 90 contacts last 45 days, we can find the number of pairs of contacts he uses per day. We divide 90 contacts by 45 days to get 2 contacts per day.

Now, we know Pete buys 2 boxes of contacts. Each box has 90 contacts, so he will have a total of 2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts.

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, he will use 2 contacts per day for 90 days. So, he will use a total of 180 contacts.

The cost of 2 boxes of contacts is $100 per box, and there's a 10% discount. To find the discount, we multiply $100 by 0.10, which is $10. So, the total cost of 2 boxes is $100 - $10 = $90.

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts by dividing the total cost by the total number of pairs. We have 180 pairs of contacts and a total cost of $90. So, the cost per pair is $90 / 180 pairs = $0.50 per pair.

The final answer is: $0.50"
"Let's figure out how much more money John earned compared to Jill.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday. That's a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours. She gets paid $10 an hour, so she made 3 x $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 x 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 x 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. Since he gets paid $10 an hour, he made 7 x $10 = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"Hannah needs to drink water after exercising. She burns calories when she does aerobics and runs. To find out how much water she needs to drink, we need to know how many calories she burns.

Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour, and she does it for 2 hours. So, she burns 500 * 2 = 1000 calories from aerobics.

Running burns 600 calories per hour, and she does it for 1 hour. So, she burns 600 * 1 = 600 calories from running.

To find the total calories she burns, we add the calories from aerobics and running: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Now, we need to find out how much water she needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories. To find out how many 200-calorie units there are, we divide the total calories by 200: 1600 / 200 = 8.

Since each 200-calorie unit needs 100 ml of water, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100: 8 * 100 = 800.

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the jar has red, blue, and green jelly beans. The note on the jar says that there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. We also know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500.

Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B. Then, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B (since it's 1% fewer than blue jelly beans) and the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B (since it's 1% more than blue jelly beans).

We can write an equation to represent the total number of jelly beans: B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms: 3.01B = 4500

Now, divide both sides by 3.01: B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find R (red jelly beans) and G (green jelly beans):
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract R from G: G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

"To find the average of Jared's typing speed, we need to add up all the measurements and divide by 3.

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 words per minute (WPM). His second typing speed is 52 WPM. If he increases his typing speed by 5 words, his third typing speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, let's add up all the measurements: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 ÷ 3 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. If he eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. We need to find the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options.

To do this, we need to calculate how much weight he'll lose or gain in 5 weeks. 

Weight lost per week: -1.25 pounds
Weight gained per week: 1.75 pounds

We multiply the weight change per week by the number of weeks to find the total weight change.

Weight change after 5 weeks:
-1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds (lost)
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds (gained)

Now, we need to find the difference in weight. To do this, we subtract the weight lost from the weight gained.

Difference in weight: 8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

"So Alex is planning an event and she wants to know how many seats she needs. She sends out 100 emails to her friends, and each of those friends says they'll bring 2 more friends. That's a lot of people! Let's count them: 100 (her friends) + 200 (their friends) = 300 people.

Then, Alex calls 10 of her other friends and 8 of them say they're bringing their spouses. That's 10 (her friends) + 8 (their spouses) = 18 more people.

Now, we need to add all these people together: 300 (from the emails) + 18 (from the phone calls) = 318 people. But wait, we forgot Alex herself! We need to add 1 more to the total.

So, the total number of people coming to the event is 318 + 1 = 319.

"Let's figure out how much the Mastiff weighs. We know the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 x 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. To find one-fourth of 20, we can divide 20 by 4. That's 20 ÷ 4 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how much the Mastiff weighs. We know the Mastiff weighs 44 times as much as the Papillon. So, we multiply 5 by 44. That's 5 x 44 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"Let's figure out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay.

First, we need to find out how much the boots cost on eBay. The boots cost $13, and the shipping is $8 because it's twice as much as Amazon's shipping, which is $4.

So, the total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, let's find out how much the boots cost on Amazon. The boots cost $16, and the shipping is $4. So, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

"Let's solve this problem step by step. We know that the beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles in height every day. We want to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground.

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to know how much protein he gets per day and then multiply it by 7.

First, let's find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. We know that 100 grams of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein. To find out how much protein is in 200 grams, we can multiply the protein in 100 grams by 2: 3 grams * 2 = 6 grams.

So, John gets 6 grams of protein per day. To find out how much protein he gets per week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's solve the problem. 

Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This means if we let 'x' be Jerry's current age, we can write an equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

To solve for 'x', we need to get rid of the parentheses. We can do this by distributing the 2 to both terms inside the parentheses:

x = 2x - 10

Now, we want to get 'x' by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 'x' from both sides:

x - x = 2x - x - 10
0 = x - 10

Now, we add 10 to both sides to get:

x = 10

So Jerry is 10 years old now. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

"George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant costs $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which is an extra $500. He already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15 per hour at work.

First, we need to find out how much George needs to pay in total. We know that 2 implants cost $2000 each, so 2 x $2000 = $4000. Then, we add the extra $500 for the crown, so $4000 + $500 = $4500. This is the total cost of the dental work.

Now, we need to subtract the deposit he already paid, which is $600. So, $4500 - $600 = $3900. This is how much George still needs to pay.

To find out how many hours he needs to work, we need to divide the amount he still needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15). So, $3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that the three angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Let's call the smallest angle ""x"". 

One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it's 2x. 
One angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's 3x.

We can write an equation to represent the sum of the three angles: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Now, let's divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. Now that we know this, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's figure out how many gumballs Colby can buy. We need to add up all the money he has in cents.

Colby has 8 quarters. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so we multiply 8 x 25 = 200 cents.

He also has 6 dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so we multiply 6 x 10 = 60 cents.

Next, he has 14 nickels. Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so we multiply 14 x 5 = 70 cents.

Lastly, he has 15 pennies. Each penny is worth 1 cent, so we multiply 15 x 1 = 15 cents.

Now, let's add up all the money: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = 345 ÷ 5

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 x 8 = 4 pounds.

Now, we add 4 pounds to 8 pounds: 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

But then, Jamaal decides that 12 pounds is too heavy, so he uses a weight that's 2 pounds lighter than that. To find this weight, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds: 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

So, Jamaal is now using a 10-pound weight.

"To find out how long it would take for the plane to travel 2000 miles, we need to know its speed. We can find the speed by dividing the distance it traveled by the time it took.

Distance = 1200 miles
Time = 3 hours

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use the speed to find the time it would take to travel 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds of chocolates he makes in 1 hour, we need to divide 120 by 2. 

120 ÷ 2 = 60

So, Ruiz makes 60 pounds of chocolates in 1 hour.

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in 1 hour. It's given that Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. 

To find 3/4 of 60, we multiply 60 by 3 and then divide by 4.

(3/4) × 60 = (3 × 60) ÷ 4
= 180 ÷ 4
= 45

So, Marissa makes 45 pounds of chocolates in 1 hour.

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates they make together in 12 hours. 

Ruiz makes 60 pounds of chocolates in 1 hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 × 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates.
Marissa makes 45 pounds of chocolates in 1 hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 × 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"Let's figure out how much money Patrick made from selling lemonade.

First, we need to find out how many cups of lemonade Patrick sold in total. He sold lemonade for 4 hours at a rate of 15 cups per hour. We multiply the number of cups he sold per hour by the number of hours:

15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups

Then, we need to find out how much money he made from selling those 60 cups. Each cup costs $0.50, so we multiply the number of cups by the price per cup:

60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

Next, we need to find out how many cups he sold in the next 2 hours. He sold lemonade at a rate of 10 cups per hour. We multiply the number of cups he sold per hour by the number of hours:

10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups

Then, we need to find out how much money he made from selling those 20 cups. Each cup costs $0.60, so we multiply the number of cups by the price per cup:

20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Now, we add the money he made from the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours to find the total amount of money he made:

"So, let's figure out how long Jeremy's tires will last. We know that every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. That's a lot of rotations! Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. To find out how many times the tires rotate in a month, we need to multiply the number of miles driven by the number of rotations per mile.

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month × 725 rotations/mile
Rotations per month = 290,000 rotations/month

Now, we need to find out how many months the tires can last before they need to be replaced. We know the tires can handle 10,440,000 rotations before they need to be replaced. To find out how many months that is, we divide the total rotations allowed by the rotations per month.

Months before replacement = 10,440,000 rotations ÷ 290,000 rotations/month
Months before replacement = 36 months

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the number of years by dividing the total months by 12.

Years before replacement = 36 months ÷ 12 months/year
Years before replacement = 3 years

So, Jeremy's tires will last for 3 years before they need to be replaced.

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after buying the outfit, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and subtract that from the amount of money he has.

First, let's find the discount on the shirt. The discount is 30% of the price of the shirt, which is $25. To find 30% of $25, we multiply 0.3 by $25.

0.3 × $25 = $7.50

Now, let's subtract the discount from the price of the shirt to get the discounted price.

$25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Next, we need to find the total cost of the outfit. We add the price of the shirt (after the discount) to the price of the shorts.

$17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money Joe has.

$50 - $52.50 = -$2.50

Since we can't have a negative amount of money, this means Joe doesn't have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: -$2.50"
"To find out how much butter Juan needs, we need to know how many croissants he wants to make and how much butter it takes to make one dozen croissants.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply 4 dozen by 7 to find the total number of dozen croissants:
4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, we multiply 28 dozen by 12 to find the total number of croissants:
28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Now, we need to know how much butter it takes to make one dozen croissants. It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter per dozen:
336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to know the cost per meter and the length of both streets.

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Monica's street: 150 meters
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

First, we need to find the cost to repave each street. We do this by multiplying the cost per meter by the length of each street.

Cost to repave Monica's street: 194 × 150 = $29,100
Cost to repave Lewis' street: 194 × 490 = $95,060

Now, we need to find the difference between the two costs. To do this, we subtract the cost to repave Monica's street from the cost to repave Lewis' street.

$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"So, John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months of his research. But his research takes 10 times longer than that, which means it takes 5 * 10 = 50 months in total.

Now, we need to find out how much he gets each month after the first 5 months. He gets 50% more than the initial $100,000, which is 100,000 + (100,000 * 0.5) = 150,000 dollars per month.

To find the total cost for the remaining 45 months, we multiply the monthly cost by the number of months: 150,000 * 45 = 6,750,000 dollars.

Now, we add the cost for the first 5 months to the cost for the remaining 45 months: 100,000 + 6,750,000 = 6,850,000 dollars.

The final answer is: $6,850,000"
"So, let's figure out how much meat the basketball team ate. 

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. That's like a small steak, but still a steak. 
The second player had beef tips, and there were 8 of them. Each one was an ounce, so that's 8 ounces of beef tips. 
The third player had a one-pound steak. We know that 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, so that's 16 ounces of steak.

Now, let's add up the total amount of meat they ate: 
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

"So, we have a Reddit group with 1000 members. Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. We want to know how many posts the group will have in March.

First, we need to know how many days are in March. There are 31 days in March.

Now, let's think about how many posts each member makes in a day. Since each member posts 3 posts per day, and there are 1000 members, we can multiply 1000 by 3 to get the total number of posts per day. That's 1000 x 3 = 3000 posts per day.

To find the total number of posts in March, we multiply the number of posts per day by the number of days in March. So, we multiply 3000 posts per day by 31 days. That's 3000 x 31 = 93,000 posts.

The final answer is: 93000"
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to do some math.

Gary does laundry twice a week. That's 2 times a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so he does laundry 2 x 52 = 104 times in a year.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water. To find the total amount of water used in a year, we multiply the number of times Gary does laundry by the amount of water used each time: 104 x 20 = 2080 gallons.

Now, we need to find out how much a gallon of water costs. It costs $0.15 per gallon. To find the total cost, we multiply the total amount of water used by the cost per gallon: 2080 x $0.15 = $312.

So, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year.

The final answer is: $312"
"Let's figure out how much money Scarlett spent.

First, we need to find the cost of each thing she bought. 

1. The aquarium cost $10.00.
2. She bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each. To find the total cost of the rocks, we multiply 2 x $2.50 = $5.00.
3. She bought 3 pieces of coral for $2.00 each. To find the total cost of the coral, we multiply 3 x $2.00 = $6.00.
4. She bought 20 fish for $0.50 each. To find the total cost of the fish, we multiply 20 x $0.50 = $10.00.
5. The fish food cost $2.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

The final answer is: $33.00"
"To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to add up the growth each week.

At the end of the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

The next week, it doubled in height, so it was 3 x 2 = 6 inches tall.

Then, in the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so we add 4 to 6, which is 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

So, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.

The final answer is: 10"
"Prince is a butcher, and he sells meat. He sells 15 kilograms of meat every hour. He works 10 hours a day. His friend Bill gave him a big bull that weighs 750 kilograms. We need to find out how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat from the bull.

To do this, we need to know how much meat Prince sells in a day. Since he sells 15 kilograms of meat every hour and he works 10 hours a day, we multiply 15 by 10 to find out how much he sells in a day. That's 15 × 10 = 150 kilograms.

Now, we need to divide the total weight of the bull's meat (750 kilograms) by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day (150 kilograms). This will give us the number of days it will take to sell all the meat. So, we do 750 ÷ 150 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's figure out how many students were in the school auditorium. 

First, we need to find out how many seats are in the auditorium. There are 4 rows of seats, and each row has 18 seats. To find the total number of seats, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in each row.

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 4 × 18 = 72 seats

Now, we know that one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. To find out how many seats that is, we need to multiply the total number of seats by 1/4.

Administrators = 1/4 × 72 = 18 seats

Now, we need to find out how many seats are left. We subtract the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats.

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

Next, we know that one-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. To find out how many seats that is, we multiply the remaining seats by 1/3.

Parents = 1/3 × 54 = 18 seats

Now, we need to find out how many seats are left for the students. We subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats.

Students = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to know how many street lights there are in total and then subtract the ones that aren't working.

First, let's find the total number of street lights. We know that each pole has 4 street lights and there are 6 poles at each intersection. If there are 4 intersections, we multiply the number of poles by the number of intersections: 6 poles * 4 intersections = 24 poles. Since each pole has 4 street lights, we multiply the number of poles by 4: 24 poles * 4 street lights/pole = 96 street lights.

Now, we know that 20 street lights aren't working. To find the number of functioning street lights, we subtract the non-working lights from the total: 96 street lights - 20 street lights = 76 street lights.

The final answer is: 76"
"Let's figure out how many times both DVDs can be played before they break. We have two DVDs, and we know how many times each one has been played already.

One DVD has been played 356 times, and it can be played 1000 times before it breaks. To find out how many times it has left, we subtract the number of times it's been played from the total number of times it can be played: 1000 - 356 = 644.

The other DVD has been played 135 times and can also be played 1000 times before it breaks. To find out how many times it has left, we subtract the number of times it's been played from the total number of times it can be played: 1000 - 135 = 865.

Now, we add the remaining times for both DVDs: 644 + 865 = 1509.

"So John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks. He went twice a week, for 2 hours each time. We need to find out how much it cost. 

First, let's find out how many hours he went to physical therapy. He went 2 times a week for 6 weeks, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 times. And each time was 2 hours, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 hours.

Now, we need to find out how much it cost. Each hour costs $125. So we multiply the total hours by the cost per hour: 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000.

The final answer is: $3000"
"Let's figure out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day.

First, we need to find out how many pieces of gum Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school, and school lasts 8 hours, we can divide 8 by 2 to find out how many pieces he chews at school.

8 ÷ 2 = 4

So, Jim chews 4 pieces of gum at school. Then, he chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, which is a total of 2 more pieces. 

4 + 2 = 6

Now, we need to subtract the pieces he's already chewed from the total number of pieces he had initially. Jim had 20 pieces of gum, so we subtract 6 from 20.

20 - 6 = 14

But wait, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. To find out how many pieces he gives her, we need to divide 14 by 2.

14 ÷ 2 = 7

So, Jim gives his sister 7 pieces of gum. Now, we need to subtract 7 from the remaining gum to find out how many pieces Jim has left.

14 - 7 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we need to figure out her current age. We know that she will be 16 years old in 12 years. To find her current age, we subtract 12 from 16.

16 - 12 = 4

This means that Charmaine is currently 4 years old. Now, we need to find out how old she will be 4 years from now. We add 4 to her current age:

4 + 4 = 8

So, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's figure out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each. To find the total amount he spent, we multiply the number of baseballs by the cost of each baseball:
9 x $3 = $27

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each. To find the total amount he spent, we multiply the number of basketballs by the cost of each basketball:
8 x $14 = $112

Now, let's find the difference between the two amounts:
$112 - $27 = $85

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we need to know how many flowers are in the garden and then figure out what fraction of them have bloomed.

There are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. To find the total number of flowers, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row: 10 * 20 = 200.

Now, we know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. To find out how many flowers that is, we multiply 200 by 4/5.

4/5 * 200 = (4 * 200) / 5 = 800 / 5 = 160

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s and then to Mb/hour.

First, we know that 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb. So, to convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s, we divide 20 by 1000.

20 kb/s ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Now, we need to convert 0.02 Mb/s to Mb/hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply 0.02 Mb/s by 3600 s/h.

0.02 Mb/s × 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

So, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb/h.

The final answer is: 72"
"Let's figure out how many cars the tow truck pulled that week. 

The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first 3 days. That's 10 x 3 = 30 cars.

After that, it pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the rest of the week. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 7 - 3 = 4 days left. If it pulled 4 fewer cars each day, that means it pulled 10 - 4 = 6 cars each day.

So, for the remaining 4 days, it pulled 6 x 4 = 24 cars.

To find the total number of cars it pulled, we add the number of cars it pulled in the first 3 days and the number of cars it pulled in the remaining 4 days. That's 30 + 24 = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To figure out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to know how much taller he needs to be and how fast he grows.

First, let's find out how much taller Adam needs to be. The roller coaster is for people who are 4 feet tall, and Adam is 40 inches tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches by multiplying 4 by 12. That's 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be. We can do this by subtracting his current height from the required height: 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Next, we need to know how fast Adam grows. He grows 2 inches per year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches, we can divide the number of inches he needs to grow (8) by his growth rate (2). That's 8 ÷ 2 = 4 years.

So, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's figure out how much James made from selling the cars.

First, we need to find out how much money James got from selling the cars. He sold 10 cars for $25,000 each. So, we multiply the number of cars by the price of each car:

10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000

Next, the company paid 30% of the price to buy the cars. To find 30% of $250,000, we multiply $250,000 by 0.3:

$250,000 * 0.3 = $75,000

Now, we need to find out how much profit James made. We subtract the company's cost from the total price:

$250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

This is the profit from selling the cars. James gets a 10% commission on the profit. To find 10% of $175,000, we multiply $175,000 by 0.1:

$175,000 * 0.1 = $17,500

So, James made $17,500."
"So, Tiffany is trying to figure out how many surfers can ride a big wave without falling. She notices that when the wave is over 30 feet, only 25% of the riders can stay on their boards. And out of those riders, 60% are women. If there are 100 riders, how many men can stay upright on the wave?

First, we need to find out how many riders can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25:
100 × 0.25 = 25

Now, we need to find out how many of those riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply 25 by 0.6:
25 × 0.6 = 15

Now, we need to find out how many men can stay upright. Since there are 25 riders in total who can stay upright and 15 of them are women, the number of men who can stay upright is:
25 - 15 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's figure out the total price for all three jewels.

We know that a diamond Jewell costs $2000. The price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell. To find the price of the gold Jewell, we multiply the price of the diamond Jewell by 4/5.

Price of gold Jewell = (4/5) × $2000
= $1600

Now, we know that the price of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold. So, we subtract $400 from the price of the gold Jewell to find the price of the silver Jewell.

Price of silver Jewell = Price of gold Jewell - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

To find the total price for all three jewels, we add the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels together.

Total price = Price of diamond Jewell + Price of gold Jewell + Price of silver Jewell
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"Let's figure out how many stamps Max bought in total. 

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. We know that he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, to find the number of truck stamps, we add 3 to 16. That's 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

Now, we know that Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. To find the number of rose stamps, we subtract 9 from 19. That's 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to know how fast they are moving and how far apart they are.

Tom is driving 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving 55 miles per hour. To find out how fast Tom is catching up, we need to subtract Bob's speed from Tom's speed. This is called the relative speed.

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we need to divide the distance between them by the relative speed to find out how long it will take Tom to catch up.

Distance between them = 75 miles
Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final answer is: 5"

"Let's figure out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again.

We know that Manny's classes cost $60 in total and there are 10 classes. If his parents won't sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class, we need to find out how many classes he can miss.

Let's say Manny attends x classes at $6 per class and y classes at $10 per class. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

6x + 10y = 60

We want to find the maximum number of classes Manny can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit. We can try different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

If x = 1, 6(1) + 10y = 60
6 + 10y = 60
10y = 54
y = 5.4 (not a whole number)

If x = 2, 6(2) + 10y = 60
12 + 10y = 60
10y = 48
y = 4.8 (not a whole number)

If x = 3, 6(3) + 10y = 60
18 + 10y = 60
10y = 42
y = 4.2 (not a whole number)

If x = 4, 6(4) + 10y = 60
24 + 10y = 60
10y = 36
y = 3.6 (not a whole number)

If x = 5, 6(5) + 10y = 60
30 + 10y = 60
10y = 30
y = 3

Since x = 5 and y = 3 is a whole number solution, Manny can attend 5 classes at $6 per class and 3 classes at $10 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

The maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's figure out how many customers Julie and Jewel can serve in a week.

Jewel serves 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 50 by 7 to find out how many customers Jewel serves in a week. That's 50 × 7 = 350 customers.

Julie is twice as fast as Jewel, so she serves twice as many customers in a day. That's 50 × 2 = 100 customers per day.

To find out how many customers Julie serves in a week, we multiply 100 by 7. That's 100 × 7 = 700 customers.

Now, we add the number of customers Jewel and Julie serve in a week to find the total. That's 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"Let's figure out how many miles Lynn ran. We know Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so we multiply 4 by 5 to find out how many miles Reggie ran. 

4 × 5 = 20 miles

20 - 3 = 17 miles

So, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to know the cost of each fruit. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20. To find the cost of 5 apples, we multiply the cost of 4 apples by 5/4. This is like having 4 groups of 5 apples, so we multiply 5.20 by 5 and then divide by 4.

Cost of 5 apples = (5.20 * 5) / 4
Cost of 5 apples = 26 / 4
Cost of 5 apples = 6.50

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30. To find the cost of 5 oranges, we multiply the cost of 3 oranges by 5/3. This is like having 3 groups of 5 oranges, so we multiply 3.30 by 5 and then divide by 3.

Cost of 5 oranges = (3.30 * 5) / 3
Cost of 5 oranges = 16.50 / 3
Cost of 5 oranges = 5.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost.

Total cost = Cost of 5 apples + Cost of 5 oranges
Total cost = 6.50 + 5.50
Total cost = 12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to know the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular hole is found by multiplying its length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we need to multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add up the base price and the cost of the extra features.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade. To find one-third of $7,500, we can divide it by 3: $7,500 ÷ 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats. To find the cost of the running boards, we subtract $500 from $2,500: $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Let's figure out how much money Tim will make in a year.

First, we need to find out how much more money Tim will make each month because of his raise. To do this, we need to find 5% of $20,000. 

5% is the same as 5/100, so we multiply $20,000 by 5/100:
$20,000 × 5/100 = $1,000

Now, we add the $1,000 to his original salary to find his new monthly salary:
$20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, we need to find out how much money Tim will get as a bonus. The bonus is half of his monthly salary, so we divide $20,000 by 2:
$20,000 ÷ 2 = $10,000

Now, we add the bonus to his new monthly salary to find his total monthly income:
$21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

Finally, we multiply his total monthly income by 12 to find out how much he will make in a year:
$31,000 × 12 = $372,000

"Let's figure out how much James spent on his new wardrobe.

First, we need to find the cost of each item. 

The suits cost $750 each. James bought 10 suits, so the total cost of the suits is 10 x $750 = $7500.

The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of the suits. Since the suits cost $750, the dress pants cost 1/5 x $750 = $150 each. James bought 10 dress pants, so the total cost of the pants is 10 x $150 = $1500.

Now, let's talk about the dress shirts. James bought 3 dress shirts for each suit, and he bought 10 suits. So, he bought 10 x 3 = 30 dress shirts. Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost of the shirts is 30 x $60 = $1800.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final answer is: $10800"

"So, Bill is trying to dig a well in his backyard. He can dig 4 feet per hour through soil, but only half that fast through clay, which means he can dig 2 feet per hour through clay. He has to dig through 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay.

First, let's figure out how long it takes him to dig through the soil. We can do this by dividing the total feet of soil by the rate at which he digs through it: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to dig through the clay. We can do this by dividing the total feet of clay by the rate at which he digs through it: 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Now, we need to add these two times together to find the total time it will take him to dig the well: 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to know how many people are getting cupcakes. We know he's getting some for himself, his teacher, and all his classmates. There are 25 classmates, and we need to add Howie and his teacher to that number.

Total number of people = 1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27

Since he's getting 2 cupcakes for each person, we multiply the total number of people by 2:
27 * 2 = 54

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

The final answer is: 54"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Fishio posted a selfie on Instagram and got 2000 likes after 1 week. Then, 3 weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. This means that the number of likes after 3 weeks is 70 * 2000 = 140000.

Now, we need to find the total number of likes after Fishio received 20000 more new likes. To do this, we add the new likes to the number of likes after 3 weeks.

Total likes = 140000 + 20000 = 160000.

The final answer is: 160000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. But she got a $2 discount because she had a voucher. So, the total cost is:
20 x $20 - $2 = $398

The next day, the price of pomegranates went up to $30 each. But the store gave a 10% discount on the total cost. If Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, the total cost would be:
20 x $30 = $600

Now, let's find the discount. 10% of $600 is:
0.1 x $600 = $60

So, the total cost with the discount is:
$600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the two costs:
$540 - $398 = $142

The final answer is: $142"
"Let's figure out how much money Ariadne made in two months.

First, we know that Ariadne sold red hats for $400 in a month. We also know that this is half of what she made from selling green hats. Let's call the money she made from green hats ""x"". Since $400 is half of x, we can write an equation: x/2 = 400.

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 400 * 2 = 800.

So, in the first month, Ariadne made $800 from green hats and $400 from red hats. That's a total of $800 + $400 = $1200.

Now, let's think about the second month. We know that Ariadne made 3/4 of what she made in the first month. To find 3/4 of $1200, we multiply $1200 by 3 and then divide by 4: (3/4) * 1200 = (3 * 1200) / 4 = 3600 / 4 = 900.

So, in the second month, Ariadne made $900.

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the money she made in the first and second months: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"Let's figure out how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage. 

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. But he gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice the cost of the first hour, which is 2 * $15 = $30.

So, the total cost is $15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $30 (third hour) = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's figure out how much money was taken out of Sally's paycheck. 

We know Sally's bank account started with $200. Now it has $420. We also know she should have gotten $300 this week. 

To find out how much money she should have in her account, we add the money she already had to the money she should have gotten. 

$200 (initial money) + $300 (expected wage) = $500

Since she actually has $420, we need to find the difference between $500 and $420 to see how much money was taken out. 

$500 - $420 = $80

So, $80 was taken out of Sally's paycheck."
"To figure out how many eggs Lori needs, we need to know how many deviled egg halves her guests will eat. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she's inviting 16 guests, we multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat.

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many eggs she needs to make 48 deviled egg halves. We can do this by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.

48 deviled egg halves / 2 deviled egg halves per egg = 24 eggs

Now, we need to figure out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12.

24 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 2 dozens of eggs

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to figure out 2/3 of the total pages since she's already done 1/3 of the paper.

Let's break it down: 

Total pages = 15
Pages already written = 1/3 * 15
To find 1/3 of 15, we can multiply 15 by 1 and then divide by 3.
1/3 * 15 = (1 * 15) / 3
1/3 * 15 = 15 / 3
1/3 * 15 = 5

Now, we need to find 2/3 of the total pages. We can do this by subtracting the pages already written from the total pages.
Pages left to write = Total pages - Pages already written
Pages left to write = 15 - 5
Pages left to write = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Days to finish the book = Total pages ÷ Pages read per day
= 200 ÷ 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the total number of days.

Days before the deadline = Total days - Days to finish the book
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"So, James bought a plane for $150,000. He also pays $5000 a month to rent a hanger to keep it in. That's a lot of money! He also spends twice as much as that on fuel per month. 

To find out how much he spends on fuel, we need to multiply the hanger rental by 2. So, $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month on fuel. 

Now, let's calculate how much he spends on hanger rental and fuel per year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply the monthly costs by 12. 

Hanger rental per year: $5000 * 12 = $60,000
Fuel per year: $10,000 * 12 = $120,000

Now, let's add up the costs: the cost of the plane, the hanger rental, and the fuel. 

$150,000 (plane) + $60,000 (hanger rental) + $120,000 (fuel) = $330,000

The final answer is: $330,000"
"Let's figure out how long it took Finley to cook all the food. We know that it took her 30 minutes to cook rice. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.

Now, let's think about the beans. It took her half the combined cooking time of pork and rice to cook the beans. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

So, we have the cooking times for all the food: 
- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

To find the total cooking time, we add up the cooking times for all the food: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have two mixtures of nuts. The first mixture has 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts. The second mixture has 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts.

First, we need to find the cost of each mixture. We know that almonds cost $10 per pound and walnuts cost $15 per pound.

For the first mixture:
- Cost of almonds: 1/2 pound * $10/pound = $5
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture:
- Cost of almonds: 1/5 pound * $10/pound = $2
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
Difference = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture
Difference = $10 - $7
Difference = $3

The final answer is: $3"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of legs is 70 and the total number of animals is 20.

Let's use the information to make two equations:

1. The total number of legs: 4S + 2G = 70
2. The total number of animals: S + G = 20

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Now, let's substitute G = 20 - S into the first equation: 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's figure out how much Roger spent at the store.

First, we need to find out how much the more expensive coffee costs. The normal coffee costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive one costs 20% more. To find 20% of $5, we multiply $5 by 0.2. 

$5 × 0.2 = $1

So, the more expensive coffee costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, and he wants a week's worth, which is 7 days. So, he needs 7 pounds of coffee.

The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 × $6 = $42.

Roger also buys a donut for $2.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut: $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"Let's figure out how much the apple pie cost. Gus spent $20.00 at the store. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00, and a bottle of soda for $1.00. 

First, let's add up the cost of the chips: 2 x $2.00 = $4.00. Then, we add the cost of the fried chicken: $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00. Finally, we add the cost of the soda: $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, we need to find out how much the apple pie cost. To do that, we subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the $20.00 he spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Let's use the numbers we know:

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

To find the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we need to subtract the newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total. We can do this by adding the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C, and then subtracting that number from the total.

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
= 600 - (198 + 209)
= 600 - 407
= 193

The final answer is: 193"
"So, John is taking a cooking class. It meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, and that's for 6 weeks. To find out how many recipes he learns, we need to know how many hours he spends in class and then divide that by the time it takes to learn a new recipe.

First, let's find out how many hours he spends in class per week. He goes to class 4 times a week, and each time is 2 hours. So, that's 4 x 2 = 8 hours per week.

Now, we need to multiply that by the number of weeks, which is 6. So, 8 hours per week x 6 weeks = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours. To find out how many recipes he learns, we need to divide the total hours by 1.5. That's 48 ÷ 1.5 = 32.

"There are 150 teachers on the school basketball court. We know that 60% of them are history teachers. To find out how many history teachers there are, we need to do a little math.

60% of 150 is the same as 0.6 x 150. Let's do the math:

0.6 x 150 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers. Now, we need to find out how many math teachers there are. We can do this by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

150 - 90 = 60

There are 60 math teachers. Now, we know that each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find out how many hours the math teachers sleep in total, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep:

60 x 6 = 360

The math teachers sleep for a total of 360 hours in one day.

The final answer is: 360"
"Let's figure out how much money each person has.

We know that Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. To find out how much Kassidy has, we multiply 120 by 3 and then divide by 4.

(3/4) × 120 = (3 × 120) / 4
= 360 / 4
= 90

So, Kassidy has $90. Now, we need to find out how much Rayna has. We know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy.

Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $60
= $90 + $60
= $150

Now, we need to add up the money of all three and divide it by 3 to find out how much each person would have if they shared it equally.

Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
= $120 + $90 + $150
= $360

Money per person = Total money ÷ 3
= $360 ÷ 3

"Let's figure out how much change Adam got.

First, we need to find the total cost of the candies. We know Adam bought 7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B. One candy of type A costs $0.5 and one candy of type B costs $0.75.

To find the total cost of type A candies, we multiply the number of candies by the cost of each candy: 7 x $0.5 = $3.50.

To find the total cost of type B candies, we multiply the number of candies by the cost of each candy: 10 x $0.75 = $7.50.

Now, we add the total cost of type A candies and type B candies to find the total cost: $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Since Adam paid $15, we need to find the change he got. To do this, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid: $15 - $11 = $4.

We know that Christina recorded her mood every day for 30 days. She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. We also know that her first 8 days were good, her next 8 days were bad, and her next 8 days were neutral.

So, we can count the good days she already had: 8 good days + 3 more good days = 11 good days. But we know she had 12 good days in total. That means she had 12 - 11 = 1 more good day left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Janey has 21 books and she has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. We can write this as an equation:

2x + 3 = 21

Where 'x' is the number of books Sally has. To find 'x', we need to get it by itself on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Now, we need to get rid of the 2 that's being multiplied by 'x'. We can do this by dividing both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books."
"So, Mrs. Jameson's bamboo grows 30 inches a day. Right now, it's 20 feet tall. We need to find out how many days it will take for it to reach 600 inches.

First, let's convert the 20 feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 20 feet by 12 inches/foot:

20 feet × 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. We subtract the current height from the target height:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches ÷ 30 inches/day = 12 days

So, it will take the bamboo 12 days to reach 600 inches.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's figure out how many toys James needs for the dog shelter.

James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. Then, there are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys. That's a total of 4 + 8 = 12 toys.

When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs as when he left. Since there were 8 dogs initially, there are now 8 x 2 = 16 more dogs. So, there are 4 + 8 + 16 = 28 dogs in total. Each dog needs 1 toy, so James needs 28 more toys. Now, he needs a total of 12 + 28 = 40 toys.

But, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. So, we need to subtract 3 from the total number of toys he needs. That's 40 - 3 = 37 toys.

The final answer is: 37"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to do some simple math.

First, let's find out how much money Dylan invested. Dylan invested 2/5 of $1200. To do this, we multiply 2/5 by 1200.

(2/5) × 1200 = 2 × 240 = 480

So, Dylan invested $480. Now, we need to find out how much money was left after Dylan's investment.

$1200 - $480 = $720

Next, we need to find out how much money Frances invested. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining $720.

(2/3) × 720 = 2 × 240 = 480

So, Frances invested $480. Now, we need to find out how much money was left after Frances' investment.

$720 - $480 = $240

This means Skyler invested $240.

"Let's figure out how many more signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect. We know they already have 20 signatures from Carol and 44 signatures from Jennifer. 

Total signatures so far = 20 + 44 = 64

They want to have a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the signatures they already have from their goal.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36

Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, we need to find out how many signatures they need to collect per week to reach their goal.

Signatures needed per week = 36 ÷ 3 = 12

The sisters need to collect 12 signatures per week for the next three weeks to reach their goal of 100 signatures.

"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we need to know how much she earns per hour and how many hours she works in two days.

First, we need to find out how much Karen earns per hour. We know that Lorie earns $10 per hour, and Karen earns twice as much as Lorie. So, Karen earns 2 x $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 x 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 x 6 = $120.

"To find out how many hash browns we can make from 96 potatoes, we need to know how many hash browns we can make from 1 potato. 

If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can divide 36 by 6 to find out how many hash browns 1 potato makes. 

36 ÷ 6 = 6

So, 1 potato makes 6 hash browns. Now, we can multiply 6 hash browns by 96 potatoes to find out how many hash browns we can make from 96 potatoes.

6 × 96 = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"So, let's figure out how much the elevator will be overloaded. We know that the elevator can hold a maximum of 700 kg, and there are 9 adults in the elevator. Each adult weighs about 80 kg.

To find the total weight of the 9 adults, we multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults.

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg × 9 = 720 kg

Now, we need to find out how much more weight the elevator can hold. To do that, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight of the 9 adults.

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

So, the elevator will be overloaded by 20 kg.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's figure out how many cookies they have in total. We know Katarina has 68 cookies. 

Max has 5 more cookies than Katarina, so we add 5 to 68: 68 + 5 = 73. That's how many cookies Max has.

The Cookie Monster has 12 less cookies than Max, so we subtract 12 from 73: 73 - 12 = 61. That's how many cookies the Cookie Monster has.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so we add 23 to 73: 73 + 23 = 96. That's how many cookies Summer has.

Now, we add up the number of cookies each person has: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298.

The final answer is: 298"
"Let's figure out the original length of Shania's dress. We know that the final length is 140cm, and she added 20cm to the bottom of the dress. We also know that the dress was extended by 50% of its original length.

Let's call the original length 'x'. When you extend something by 50%, you're adding half of it to itself. So, the extension is 0.5x. Then, you add 20cm to that extension.

The total length is the original length plus the extension, which is x + 0.5x + 20. We can simplify this to 1.5x + 20.

We know the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the 20 on the left side. We can do this by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation: 1.5x = 140 - 20.

This simplifies to 1.5x = 120.

Now, we need to get x by itself. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.5: x = 120 / 1.5.

x = 80.

"To find out how long it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to know how long it takes him to mow the whole lawn in each mode. 

In turtle mode, it takes him 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. In rabbit mode, it takes him 40 minutes. 

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to find half of the time it takes for each mode. 

Half of 60 minutes is 60 / 2 = 30 minutes. Half of 40 minutes is 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.

Now, we add the time for both modes to get the total time. 

30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

First, we need to add the time it takes to get to the fire station. We do this by adding 6 minutes and 13 minutes together. 

6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Now, we need to find out how much time they have left to get to school. We do this by subtracting the time it takes to get to the fire station from the total time they have. 

30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

So, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late."
"To find out how much money Catherine paid, we need to add up the cost of all the things she bought.

First, let's find the cost of the apples. She bought 1 kilo of apples for $4.

Next, we need to find the cost of the bananas. She bought 2 kilos of bananas, and each kilo costs $2. So, the total cost of the bananas is 2 x $2 = $4.

Now, let's find the cost of the oranges. She bought 2 kilos of oranges, and each kilo costs $3. So, the total cost of the oranges is 2 x $3 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"Let's figure out how many cookies are left in the box. 

Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta, so she bakes 2 x 30 = 60 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add Greta's cookies and Celinda's cookies: 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

Now, they eat 10 cookies, so we need to subtract 10 from the total number of cookies: 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

So, there are 80 cookies left in the box.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. If their combined ages are 44, we need to find the age of one of the twins.

Let's say the age of the younger twin is T. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of the older twin is T + 7. The age of the triplet is t.

We know that the sum of their ages is 44, so we can write an equation: T + (T + 7) + t = 44

We also know that the older twin is 7 years older than the triplet, so we can write another equation: T + 7 = t

Now, let's simplify the second equation to find the relationship between T and t: T = t - 7

Now, we can substitute T = t - 7 into the first equation: (t - 7) + (t - 7 + 7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t = 44

Divide by 3: t = 44 / 3
t = 14.67

Since T = t - 7, the age of the younger twin is T = 14.67 - 7 = 7.67

The age of the older twin is T + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.67}$"
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to know how much time he has before dinner and how much time he spends on homework.

John has 3 hours before dinner. We need to convert this to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes.

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, let's add up the time John spends on homework. He has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework.

20 minutes + 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner.

180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for a total of $3.20. We also know that each lollipop costs $0.40.

To find the cost of one candy, we need to subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 x $0.40 = $2.00. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. This is the cost of 4 candies.

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies: $1.20 ÷ 4 = $0.30.

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 x $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 x $0.30 = $3.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the lollipops and the cost of the candies: $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"Let's figure out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 more coins than Rong. To find out how many more coins Neil saves, we need to multiply 2/5 by 20. 

2/5 * 20 = 8

So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins every month.

Now, let's find out how many coins they save in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply their monthly savings by 12.

Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's find out how many coins they save in 10 years. We multiply their yearly savings by 10.

Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

To find the total number of coins they have after 10 years, we add their savings together.

2400 + 3360 = 5760

The final answer is: 5760"
"So John's dog needs 2 vaccines that cost $20 each, and a heartworm check. Let's first find the total cost of the vaccines. We multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2: 2 x $20 = $40.

Now, we need to find the cost of the heartworm check. We know it's 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to get rid of the 0.6x on the right side. We can do this by subtracting 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by dividing both sides by 0.4: x = $40 / 0.4 = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 x $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To find the price of the crate of fruit, we need to know how much each type of fruit costs. We know that one apple costs $0.5. Since a banana costs twice as much as an apple, a banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1. An orange costs three times as much as a banana, so an orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's find the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the total number of squares on Brittany's comforter, we need to figure out how many of each color there are and add them together.

Let's start with the red squares. We know there are 14 of those. 

Next, we know there are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, we add 4 to 14 to find the number of blue squares: 14 + 4 = 18.

Then, we know there are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, we add 6 to 18 to find the number of green squares: 18 + 6 = 24.

Finally, we know there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, we subtract 12 from 24 to find the number of white squares: 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we add the number of squares of each color together: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68.

The total number of squares is 68. Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"Let's figure out how many more chairs Mia needs for her restaurant. 

First, we need to know how many chairs she already has. We know she has 8 high chairs. Since she has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, we multiply 8 by 5 to find out how many regular chairs she has.

8 high chairs × 5 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we need to know how many chairs she needs in total. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies, so we add those together.

42 adults + 15 babies = 57 chairs needed

Now, we need to find out how many chairs she already has. We add the high chairs and the regular chairs together.

8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs

To find out how many more chairs she needs, we subtract the number of chairs she has from the number of chairs she needs.

57 chairs needed - 48 chairs available = 9 more chairs

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to do two steps. First, we need to find out how many bucks there are in the field. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we multiply 50 by 0.5 (which is the same as 50%).

50 x 0.5 = 25

So, there are 25 bucks in the field. Now, we need to find 20% of the bucks that are 8 points. To do this, we multiply 25 by 0.2 (which is the same as 20%).

25 x 0.2 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 8-point bucks in the field."
"Let's figure out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip.

Adam has 50 points. Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3. That's 0.3 × 50 = 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. That's 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. That's 3 × 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up all the points: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points they're missing, we subtract 255 from 400. That's 400 - 255 = 145 points.

The final answer is: 145"
"So, Great Grandma Jones has 3 kids. Each of her kids has 3 kids of their own, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 grandkids. Now, each of those grandkids has 3 babies, so we multiply 9 by 3 to find out how many great grand-babies there are. 

9 x 3 = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's figure out how much money Greta has left to spend after putting money into her retirement account and paying for her car.

First, we need to find out how much she puts into her retirement account. To do this, we need to find 50% of her paycheck. 50% is the same as 0.5. So, we multiply 0.5 by $2400.00.

0.5 x $2400.00 = $1200.00

This means Greta puts $1200.00 into her retirement account.

Next, we need to find out how much she uses for her car payment. To do this, we need to find 20% of her paycheck. 20% is the same as 0.2. So, we multiply 0.2 by $2400.00.

0.2 x $2400.00 = $480.00

This means Greta uses $480.00 for her car payment.

Now, we need to subtract the amounts from her paycheck to find out how much she has left to spend.

$2400.00 - $1200.00 = $1200.00
$1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00

So, Greta has $720.00 left to spend.

"Let's figure out how many pairs of pencils are in the box. First, we need to know how many pencils are in the box. Since there are 4 pencils missing, we need to subtract 4 from the total number of pencils the box can hold.

The box can hold 20 pencils. If 4 pencils are missing, we subtract 4 from 20.

20 - 4 = 16

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of pencils we have. Since a pair is 2 pencils, we divide the number of pencils by 2.

16 ÷ 2 = 8

So, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see, we need to figure out how many fireworks are in the city display and how many she will set off in her backyard.

First, let's find out how many fireworks are in the city display. There are 15 boxes of fireworks, and each box has 20 fireworks. To find the total number of fireworks, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of fireworks in each box:

15 boxes × 20 fireworks/box = 15 × 20 = 300 fireworks

Now, we need to find out how many of these fireworks Hannah can see. She can see 40% of the city's fireworks. To find 40% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.4:

300 × 0.4 = 120

Next, let's find out how many fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard. She will set off 3 boxes of fireworks, and each box has 5 fireworks. To find the total number of fireworks, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of fireworks in each box:

3 boxes × 5 fireworks/box = 3 × 5 = 15

Now, we add the number of fireworks Hannah can see from the city display and the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard:

120 + 15 = 135

"Let's figure out how much money Aiden and his friends spent on snacks and drinks.

First, we need to find out how many people are going to the movie. Aiden has 12 friends, and they're meeting 7 more friends there. So, we add 12 + 7 = 19 people.

Each seat can hold 1 person, 2 drinks, and 3 snacks. Since there are 19 people, we need to buy drinks and snacks for 19 people. We multiply 19 by 2 to find out how many drinks we need: 19 x 2 = 38 drinks. We multiply 19 by 3 to find out how many snacks we need: 19 x 3 = 57 snacks.

Now, we add the number of drinks and snacks together: 38 + 57 = 95 items.

Each drink and snack costs $2. So, we multiply 95 items by $2: 95 x $2 = $190.

The final answer is: $190"
"Let's figure out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry.

We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

If we add up the pounds that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry, we get 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

Now, we know that all three trucks together can carry 11,600 pounds of gravel. To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the pounds that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total pounds that all three trucks can carry.

So, we subtract 8,800 from 11,600:

11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

The final answer is: 2800"
"Let's figure out how many dumplings Larry cooked.

There are 8 guys and 6 girls, so in total, there are 8 + 6 = 14 people.

Each girl ate 3 dumplings, so the girls ate a total of 6 x 3 = 18 dumplings.

Since each guy ate 1 more dumpling than each girl, each guy ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

The guys ate a total of 8 x 4 = 32 dumplings.

To find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we need to add the dumplings eaten by the girls and the guys. So, 18 (girls) + 32 (guys) = 50 dumplings.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much money Gerald had initially. We know that Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. This means that for every 3 parts Gerald gets, Julia gets 2 parts. To find out how much money Gerald gets, we need to add 3 and 2, which is 5 parts in total.

Now, we need to find out how much money 1 part is worth. We can do this by dividing $100 by 5, which is the total number of parts. 

$100 ÷ 5 = $20 per part

Since Gerald gets 3 parts, we can multiply 3 by $20 to find out how much money he had initially.

3 x $20 = $60

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we need to subtract $10 from $60 to find out how much money he has left.

$60 - $10 = $50

"To find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we need to know how fast it crawls. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, and the cat can run 15 feet per second, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 ÷ 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = Speed of the turtle * 40
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: 120"
"So, the firefighters want to raise $6300. They already raised $2100 in 3 hours. To find out how much they raise per hour, we need to divide the amount they raised by the number of hours. That's $2100 ÷ 3 = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The total goal is $6300, and they already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour: $4200 ÷ $700 = 6 hours.

Since they already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours: 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break it down step by step. We know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Now, we need to find out how much of that 40% is used for non-industrial purposes.

First, we need to find out how much of the 40% is used for industrial purposes. We know that 80% of the 40% is used for industrial purposes. To find 80% of 40%, we multiply 0.8 by 0.4. 

0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32

So, 32% of the water from the Colorado River is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City.

Now, to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city:

40% - 32% = 8%

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Now, we know Alex charges $12 per day. To find the total amount she charges, we multiply the number of days by the daily charge.

14 days * $12/day = $168

So, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"Let's figure out how much ice cream the factory makes in 48 hours.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find out how many quarts it makes per hour, we need to divide 100 by 2. That's 100 ÷ 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find out how many quarts it makes per hour, we need to divide 50 by 4. That's 50 ÷ 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's find out how many quarts of chocolate ice cream the factory makes in 48 hours. We multiply 50 quarts per hour by 48 hours. That's 50 × 48 = 2400 quarts.

Next, let's find out how many quarts of vanilla ice cream the factory makes in 48 hours. We multiply 12.5 quarts per hour by 48 hours. That's 12.5 × 48 = 600 quarts.

"Let's figure out Marcus' total bill. 

First, we need to find the cost of each item. 

Marcus bought 5 croissants for $3.00 each, so that's 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.

He also bought 4 cinnamon rolls for $2.50 each, so that's 4 x $2.50 = $10.00.

Then, he bought 3 mini quiches for $4.00 each, so that's 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.

Lastly, he bought 13 blueberry muffins for $1.00 each, so that's 13 x $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, we need to add up all these costs to find the total. $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

But wait, Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase. To find the discount, we multiply $50.00 by 0.10 (which is the same as 10%). So, 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total to find the final bill. $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"Let's figure out how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy. 

First, we need to know how much each scoop costs. It's $1.50. Erin has $6.00. To find out how many scoops she can buy, we need to divide $6.00 by $1.50.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4

But, there's a deal. If Erin buys 2 scoops, she gets 1 free. So, she can get 3 scoops for the price of 2. Let's see how much she'll spend on 3 scoops.

2 scoops cost $1.50 each, so 2 x $1.50 = $3.00. But, she gets 1 free, so she only pays $3.00 for 3 scoops.

Now, Erin has $6.00 - $3.00 = $3.00 left. She can use this money to buy 2 more scoops, since each scoop costs $1.50.

2 x $1.50 = $3.00

So, Erin can buy 2 more scoops with the remaining money. In total, she can buy 3 scoops with the deal and 2 more scoops with the remaining money.

"Let's figure out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger after two weeks.

We know that Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. We need to find out how many pieces they eat in two weeks.

There are 14 days in two weeks. To find out how many pieces Ginger eats in two weeks, we multiply 4 pieces by 14 days: 4 x 14 = 56 pieces.

To find out how many pieces Amy eats in two weeks, we multiply 3 pieces by 14 days: 3 x 14 = 42 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces of candy each person has left. Ginger had 100 pieces and ate 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy had 100 pieces and ate 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

"Mr. Boarden is remodeling his bathroom. He needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot. To find out how many tiles he needs for his bathroom, we need to know the area he wants to cover.

His bathroom is 36 square feet, and he wants to cover two thirds of it. To find two thirds of 36, we can multiply 36 by 2 and then divide by 3.

(2/3) * 36 = (2 * 36) / 3
= 72 / 3
= 24

So, Mr. Boarden needs to cover 24 square feet. Now, we multiply the area by the number of tiles per square foot to find the total number of tiles he needs.

24 * 24 = 576

Mr. Boarden needs 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom.

The final answer is: 576"
"Let's figure out how much James saved by picking blueberries.

First, we need to find out how much it cost James to pick the blueberries. He had to pay $20 to go picking, and then he had to pay $1.5 per pound for the blueberries. He picked 30 pounds of blueberries, so we multiply 30 pounds by $1.5 per pound: 30 x $1.5 = $45. Then we add the $20 he paid to go picking: $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, let's find out how much it would have cost James to buy the blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries for $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds, so we multiply 30 pounds by $2.5 per pound: 30 x $2.5 = $75.

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking the blueberries from the cost of buying them at the store: $75 - $65 = $10.

"So, the company wants to buy 500 computers and they have $700 for each computer. But when they go to order, they find out the price of each computer is 10% higher than they thought.

To find the new price of each computer, we need to calculate 10% of $700. To do this, we multiply $700 by 0.1 (since 10% is the same as 0.1). 

0.1 x $700 = $70

Now, we add this to the original price of $700 to get the new price.

$700 + $70 = $770

So, the new price of each computer is $770. Now, we need to find the total amount of money the company paid for 500 computers.

"To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to add up the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

First, let's find the calories from the eggs: 6 eggs * 75 calories per egg = 6 x 75 = 450 calories

Next, we need to find the calories from the cheese and ham. Since they are equal amounts, we can multiply the calories per ounce by 2. The cheese is 120 calories per ounce, so 2 oz * 120 calories per oz = 2 x 120 = 240 calories. The ham is 40 calories per ounce, so 2 oz * 40 calories per oz = 2 x 40 = 80 calories.

Now, we add up the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories

Since you paid $10, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount you paid to find the change: $10 - $5.00 = $5.00

The final answer is: $5.00"
"So, let's figure out how many people accept the job at Google. We know that 100 people apply, and 30% of them get an interview. To find 30% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.3. That's 0.3 x 100 = 30 people who get an interview.

Now, 20% of those 30 people get a job offer. To find 20% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.2. That's 0.2 x 30 = 6 people who get a job offer.

Finally, a third of those 6 people accept the job. To find a third of 6, we divide 6 by 3. That's 6 ÷ 3 = 2 people who accept the job.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice. She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. We need to find out how many kilograms of rice she gave to her cousin and brother.

First, we need to find the total number of sacks she gave away. We can do this by adding the sacks she gave to her cousin and brother.

3 sacks (to her cousin) + 4 sacks (to her brother) = 7 sacks

Since there are 25 kilograms of rice in each sack, we need to multiply the total number of sacks by the weight of each sack.

7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms

So, Goldy gave 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother."
"To find out how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week than last week, we need to subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week.

This week, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops. To find the total number of boxes she bought this week, we add 3 + 5. 

3 + 5 = 8

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

To find the difference, we subtract 4 from 8.

8 - 4 = 4

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"Let's figure out how many times Helga taps her feet. We need to find out how many times she taps her feet when her arms are down and when her arms are up, and then add those numbers together.

When Helga's arms are down, she taps her right foot 300 times per minute and her left foot 250 times per minute. To find the total number of taps per minute, we add those numbers together: 300 + 250 = 550. Since she dances for 3 minutes with her arms down, we multiply 550 by 3 to get 1650.

When Helga's arms are up, she taps her right foot 200 times per minute and her left foot 200 times per minute. To find the total number of taps per minute, we add those numbers together: 200 + 200 = 400. Since she dances for 2 minutes with her arms up, we multiply 400 by 2 to get 800.

Now, we add the number of taps when her arms are down (1650) to the number of taps when her arms are up (800) to get the total number of taps: 1650 + 800 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"So, Ron is really mad about the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to cost him $450 to fix the damage to his car. But, if he fixes it himself, the city council will fine him $120. He also needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, and each one costs $25.

First, let's find out how much it will cost Ron to fix the pothole. The fine is $120, and the asphalt costs 3 * $25 = $75. So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $120 + $75 = $195.

Now, we need to find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole. We do this by subtracting the cost of fixing the pothole from the cost of not fixing it. So, $450 - $195 = $255.

The final answer is: $255"
"Let's count the chairs left in the restaurant. We have 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs. If 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs were sent to the carpenter for repair, we need to subtract those from the total.

First, let's add the normal and baby chairs together to get the total number of chairs. 170 + 23 = 193

Now, let's subtract the chairs that were sent for repair. We need to subtract 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs. 20 + 13 = 33 chairs were sent for repair.

Now, let's subtract 33 from the total number of chairs. 193 - 33 = 160

The restaurant has 160 chairs left.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many slices of pizza were eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can multiply the number of people (3) by 2/3 and 12 slices per pizza.

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Now, we need to find out how many slices were eaten by the other two friends. They ate 3/4 of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these two friends is:

2 friends * 9 slices/friend = 18 slices

Now, we add the number of slices eaten by both groups of friends:

24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

Since there are 5 people in total, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:

5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:

60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find out how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we need to multiply the time it takes the cat by 2/3. 

Time taken by cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by dog = (2/3) × 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Now, we need to find the average time it takes both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. We can do this by adding the time taken by the cat and the dog, and then dividing by 2.

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's figure out how long one of Bobby's shoes is. We know that Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. First, we need to convert the feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is 8 x 12 = 96 inches. Adding 4 inches to that makes 100 inches for Topher's shoe.

Now, we know that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe 'x'. We can write an equation to represent this: 9x + 10 = 100.

To solve for 'x', we need to get rid of the 10 on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides: 9x = 100 - 10, which simplifies to 9x = 90.

Next, we need to get 'x' by itself. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 9: x = 90 / 9.

x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's figure out how many windows Hannah smashed.

First, we need to find out how many windows she smashed from the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. If she smashed a quarter of the windows, that means she smashed 1 out of 4 of the windows. To find out how many windows that is, we multiply 64 by 4 (since there are 4 windows per car) and then divide by 4 (since she smashed a quarter of the windows).

64 * 4 = 256
256 ÷ 4 = 64

So, Hannah smashed 64 windows from the students' cars.

Next, we need to find out how many windows she smashed from the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows. If she smashed 3 out of 4 of the windows, that means she smashed 3/4 of the windows. To find out how many windows that is, we multiply 32 by 2 (since there are 2 windows per car) and then multiply by 3/4.

32 * 2 = 64
(3/4) * 64 = 48

So, Hannah smashed 48 windows from the teachers' cars.

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars:
64 + 48 = 112

The final answer is: 112"
"To find the percentage of blue spools, we need to know how many blue spools there are and how many spools there are in total.

First, let's count the blue spools. We have 15 light blue spools and 45 dark blue spools. So, the total number of blue spools is 15 + 45 = 60.

Next, we need to count all the spools. We have 15 light blue, 45 dark blue, 40 light green, and 50 dark green spools. So, the total number of spools is 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

(60 ÷ 150) × 100 = 40%

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that 5000 people were at the polling station at 8:00. By midday, 2/5 of them had voted. To find out how many people voted by midday, we multiply 2/5 by 5000.

2/5 × 5000 = 2000

So, 2000 people voted by midday.

Now, we need to find out how many people voted by 16:00. We know that 3000 people were left after midday (since 5000 - 2000 = 3000). Then, 2/3 of these 3000 people voted by 16:00.

2/3 × 3000 = 2000

This means 2000 more people voted by 16:00. So, the total number of people who voted by 16:00 is 2000 (from midday) + 2000 (from 16:00) = 4000.

To find out how many people had not voted by 16:00, we subtract the number of people who voted from the total number of people.

5000 - 4000 = 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To figure out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to know how many pieces of gum he chews in 30 days and how many pieces are in a pack.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find out how many pieces he chews in 30 days, we multiply 4 by 30. That's 4 × 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

Now, we need to know how many pieces of gum are in a pack. A pack has 15 pieces of gum. To find out how many packs Parker will need, we divide the total number of pieces he chews by the number of pieces in a pack: 120 ÷ 15 = 8.

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To figure out how many boxes of graham crackers we need, we first need to find out how many s'mores everyone wants. There are 9 kids and they each want 2 s'mores, so that's 9 x 2 = 18 s'mores. Then there are 6 adults and they each want 1 s'more, so that's 6 x 1 = 6 s'mores. In total, we need 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8. That's 24 ÷ 8 = 3. Since each box has 3 sleeves, we need to divide 3 by 3, which is 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to find their individual ages.

Dora is 15 years old. 

Dora's father is eight more than twice Dora's age. We can write this as an equation: Father's age = 2 x Dora's age + 8. 
So, Father's age = 2 x 15 + 8 
= 30 + 8 
= 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. We can write this as an equation: Mother's age = Father's age - 4. 
So, Mother's age = 38 - 4 
= 34 years.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. 
Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age 
= 15 + 38 + 34 
= 87 years.

The final answer is: 87"

Her French book weighs 4 pounds, and her English book weighs 3 pounds. We also know that her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book is 3 pounds, her history book is 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all her books: 4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many votes candidate C got, we need to figure out how many votes candidate B got first. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes. To find 20% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.2. That's 100 x 0.2 = 20 votes.

Now, candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. To find 50% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.5. That's 20 x 0.5 = 10. Then we add that to 20, which is 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

So, candidate A and candidate B got a total of 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Since there are 100 voters in total, candidate C got the rest of the votes, which is 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Boris has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. To find out how many apples Beck has, we need to subtract 23 from 100.

100 - 23 = 77

So, Beck has 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. To find out how many apples Beck has now, we need to add 10 to 77.

77 + 10 = 87

Boris now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we need to subtract Beck's amount from Boris's amount.

90 - 87 = 3

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

"Let's figure out how much water Peter has left. We know he has 32 ounces of water and he wants to make different sized ice cubes.

First, let's see how much water he uses for each type of cube. He can make giant cubes that use 4 ounces each, medium cubes that use 2 ounces each, and small cubes that use 1/2 ounce each.

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the water used for all the cubes: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

To find out how much water Peter has left, we need to subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces

We know Clara has 20 books. We also know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven. To find out how many books Steven has, we can divide Clara's books by 2. 

20 ÷ 2 = 10

So, Steven has 10 books. Now, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. To find out how many books Alice has, we can add 6 to Steven's books.

10 + 6 = 16

Now, let's find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. We can subtract Alice's books from Clara's books.

20 - 16 = 4

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"Let's figure out how much money Cecelia spent at the milk store. 

First, we need to know the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and a half-gallon jar costs $2 less than a gallon jar. So, we subtract $2 from $5 to find the cost of a half-gallon jar.

Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2 = $3

Now, we need to find the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. 

Total cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 x $5 = $50
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 x $3 = $48

To find the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we add the cost of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars together.

Total amount of money Cecelia spent = $50 + $48 = $98

"Let's figure out how many students like to play video games.

We know that there are 50 students in the class. Some like to bake, some like to play basketball, and the rest like to play video games or music. We also know that 10 students like to bake and 5 like to play basketball.

If we add the students who like to bake and basketball, we get 10 + 5 = 15. That's 15 students who like to do those two things.

Now, let's subtract 15 from the total number of students to find out how many like to play video games or music. 50 - 15 = 35.

We also know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, 2 x 5 = 10 students like to play music.

So, if 10 students like to play music, then 35 - 10 = 25 students like to play video games.

So, 4 birds were scared away. Now, we subtract 4 from the initial number of birds: 
12 - 4 = 8

Then, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. 
8 + 20 = 28

The final number of birds in the backyard is 28."
"Let's figure out how many boys are in each class.

We know that there are 80 students in total, and they are divided into two classes. Since each class has the same number of students, we can divide 80 by 2 to find the number of students in each class: 80 ÷ 2 = 40 students per class.

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find 40% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.4 (which is the same as 40%): 40 × 0.4 = 16 girls per class.

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class: 40 - 16 = 24 boys per class.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. We need to find out how many buttons she has after trading some of her stickers.

First, Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. To find 90% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.9. This is the same as multiplying 30 by 9/10. 

30 × 9/10 = 27

So, Lorraine trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

Now, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. To find 50% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.5. This is the same as multiplying 40 by 1/2.

40 × 1/2 = 20

So, Lorraine trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since each large sticker is worth one large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

Now, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

Lorraine trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 × 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 3 small stickers, 20 large stickers, 27 small buttons, and 20 large buttons. To find the total number of buttons, we add these together.

3 + 20 + 27 + 20 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"So, let's figure out how many matches Joey played in one week. 

Joey played 2 matches on Monday. 
He played 1 match on Friday. 
On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 x 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add the matches played on each day: 
2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7

So, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week."
"Let's figure out how many votes were in favor of the new regulation. We know that there are 33 people on the council and that the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against.

Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is x. Then, the number of votes in favor is 2x. We know that the total number of votes is 33, so we can write an equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 33 ÷ 3
x = 11

So, there are 11 votes against the new regulation. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, we multiply 11 by 2:

2x = 2(11)
= 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the total number of shirts ordered, we need to figure out how many students need each size and add them together.

First, we know 11 students need extra-small shirts. Then, twice as many students need small shirts as extra-small, so that's 2 x 11 = 22 students.

Next, we know that 4 fewer students need medium shirts than small, so that's 22 - 4 = 18 students.

Now, half as many students need large shirts as medium, so that's 18 / 2 = 9 students.

Finally, 6 more students need extra-large shirts than large, so that's 9 + 6 = 15 students.

To find the total number of shirts ordered, we add the number of students for each size together: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75.

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the price after the discount, we need to subtract the discount from the original price. First, we need to find 5% of $140. 

5% is the same as 5/100, so we multiply $140 by 5/100.

$140 × 5/100 = $140 × 0.05 = $7

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price.

$140 - $7 = $133

So, the price after the discount is $133.

The final answer is: $133"
"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to multiply the number of songs in each playlist by the number of playlists and then multiply the result by the length of each song in hours.

First, we multiply the number of songs in each playlist by the number of playlists:
300 songs/playlist * 20 playlists = 6000 songs

Then, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song in hours:
6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60000 hours

The total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is 60000."
"Let's figure out how many people think horse #12 will win the big race.

First, we need to find out how many people think horse #2 will win. 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.2. 

50 * 0.2 = 10

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. Now, we need to find out how many people are left. We subtract 10 from 50.

50 - 10 = 40

Now, 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. To find 60% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.6.

40 * 0.6 = 24

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. Now, we need to find out how many people are left. We subtract 24 from 40.

40 - 24 = 16

The number of people who think horse #12 will win is 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's figure out how many puppies Jana has.

We know that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply 6 by 3 because 3 times 1/3 is 1, so it will give us the total number of Pomeranians.

6 * 3 = 18

So, there are 18 Pomeranians. Now, we know that 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply 18 by 3/2.

18 * (3/2) = 18 * 1.5 = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's figure out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera.

Jayden had $70 from selling pictures. His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance. To find out how much Ava gave him, we need to divide $90 by 2. 

$90 ÷ 2 = $45

Now, we add the $45 Ava gave him to the $70 Jayden already had. 

$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: 

$200 - $115 = $85

So, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"Let's figure out how many cases of shingles the third house needs.

We know that the three houses need a total of 250 cases of shingles. The first house needs half of what the second house needs, and the third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's say the second house needs x cases of shingles. Then the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles, and the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We can write an equation to represent the total number of cases of shingles needed: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply the entire equation by 2: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Now we can combine like terms: 5x = 500.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money they spent, we need to add up the cost of what each person bought.

Leila bought 3 cucumbers. Each cucumber costs $2. So, we multiply 3 by $2 to find out how much Leila spent: 3 × $2 = $6.

Jack bought 5 tomatoes. Each tomato costs $1. So, we multiply 5 by $1 to find out how much Jack spent: 5 × $1 = $5.

Chase bought 1 head of lettuce. Lettuce costs $3. So, Chase spent $3.

Now, we add up the money they spent: $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

"Let's figure out how many fruits George has. We know he has 200 bananas. We also know he has 45% more pears than bananas. To find out how many pears he has, we need to calculate 45% of 200 bananas.

To find 45% of 200, we multiply 200 by 0.45. 

200 x 0.45 = 90

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. To find the total number of pears, we add 90 to 200.

200 + 90 = 290

Now, we know George has 290 pears. To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears.

200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

The final answer is: 490"
"Let's figure out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy.

First, we need to find out how much money Marissa had left after buying the ball. She had $80 and spent $20 on the ball, so we subtract 20 from 80:

$80 - $20 = $60

Now, we know Marissa had $60 left. We also know that the candy bars cost $5 each. To find out how many candy bars she bought, we need to divide the money she had left by the cost of each candy bar:

$60 ÷ $5 = 12

"Let's figure out how many books Ahmed and Ezra read altogether.

We know that Ezra read 300 books in one hour. Since he read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can find out how many books Ahmed read by dividing 300 by 2.

300 ÷ 2 = 150

So, Ahmed read 150 books. Now, we know that Ezra is going to read 150 more books. To find out how many books he will have read in total, we add 150 to 300.

300 + 150 = 450

Now, we need to find the total number of books both Ahmed and Ezra read. We already know that Ahmed read 150 books, and Ezra will have read 450 books. To find the total, we add these two numbers together.

150 + 450 = 600

"Let's figure out how much money Tanya earned for teaching.

First, we need to find out how much she earned for each day. On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. We need to multiply the number of hours she teaches by her hourly wage, which is $15. So, 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she gets an extra $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. We multiply the number of hours she teaches by her hourly wage, which is $15. So, 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she doesn't teach more than 3 classes, she doesn't get the extra $5. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add the earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

"Let's figure out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for.

First, we need to know how much money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so we multiply 20 by 3 to find the total amount he makes from eggplants.

20 × 3 = $60

Now, Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the amount he makes from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make.

$135 - $60 = $75

This means Bennet needs to make $75 from selling the corn. He has 25 ears of corn, so we need to divide $75 by 25 to find out how much he should sell each ear for.

$75 ÷ 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find out what percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we need to know how much time she has in total and how much time she spends playing soccer.

Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so she has a total of 7 + 5 = 12 hours.

She reads for 3 hours, so we need to subtract that from the total time to find out how much time is left. 12 - 3 = 9 hours.

Now, we know she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. To find 1/3 of 9, we can multiply 9 by 1/3, which is the same as dividing 9 by 3. 9 ÷ 3 = 3, so she plays video games for 3 hours.

Now, we need to find out how much time she spends playing soccer. We know she has 9 hours left, and she plays video games for 3 hours, so she spends 9 - 3 = 6 hours playing soccer.

To find the percentage of the weekend she spends playing soccer, we need to divide the time she spends playing soccer by the total time and multiply by 100. (6 ÷ 12) * 100 = 50%.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Anthony had 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. To find 1/2 of 50, we multiply 50 by 1/2. 

50 × 1/2 = 50 × 0.5 = 25

So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon. Now, he has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find 3/5 of 25, we multiply 25 by 3/5.

25 × 3/5 = 25 × 0.6 = 15

So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie. Now, he has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to figure out how long it takes him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's find out how long it takes him to drive to the museum. We know the distance is 150 miles and he drives at 75 miles per hour. To find the time, we divide the distance by the speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since he has to drive back home, it will take him another 2 hours. So, the total time driving is 2 + 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we need to add the time he spends at the museum, which is 6 hours. 

Total time Jack is gone from home = Total time driving + Time at the museum
Total time Jack is gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time Jack is gone from home = 10 hours

$1000 - $200 = $800

So, the final price of the laptop after the discount is $800."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can divide the total number of movies by 3.

600 ÷ 3 = 200 movies in series

Now, we need to find out how much it costs to buy these movies in series. Since we can buy the series for $6 each, we multiply the number of movies in series by 6.

200 × $6 = $1200

Next, we need to find out how many movies are left. We subtract the number of movies in series from the total number of movies.

600 - 200 = 400 movies

Now, we need to find out how many of these movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we multiply 400 by 0.4.

400 × 0.4 = 160 older movies

Now, we need to find out how much it costs to buy these older movies. Since they cost $5 each, we multiply the number of older movies by 5.

160 × $5 = $800

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies.

400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

Now, we need to find out how much it costs to buy these normal movies. Since they cost $10 each, we multiply the number of normal movies by 10.

240 × $10 = $2400

Finally, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost.

$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

"Let's figure out how much money Winston spent on fruit. We need to know how much he spent on peaches, plums, and apricots.

First, we need to find out how much he spent on peaches. He picked 6 pounds of peaches, and they cost $2.00 per pound. So, we multiply 6 pounds by $2.00 per pound:

6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00

Next, we need to find out how much he spent on plums. He picked 8 pounds of plums, and they cost $1.00 per pound. So, we multiply 8 pounds by $1.00 per pound:

8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00

Now, we need to find out how much he spent on apricots. He picked 6 pounds of apricots, and they cost $3.00 per pound. So, we multiply 6 pounds by $3.00 per pound:

6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now that we know how much he spent on each type of fruit, we can add them together to find the total amount he spent:

$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to figure out how far they drove and how far they hiked, then add those two distances together.

First, let's find out how fast they hiked. They hiked at a speed that was 5 miles per hour less than half of their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's find the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's find the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ava and Emma are playing a video game, and they want to know who's better. They each get points for jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and finishing the level on time.

For every enemy Ava jumps on, she gets 10 points. For every berry she collects, she gets 5 points. And for every second she has left on the timer when she finishes the level, she gets 30 points.

Let's say Emma jumps on x enemies, collects y berries, and finishes the level in z seconds. Then, Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies, collects y + 3 berries, and finishes the level in z + 4 seconds.

We need to find the difference between their scores. To do that, we need to find their scores first.

Emma's score is 10x (for enemies) + 5y (for berries) + 30z (for time).

Ava's score is 10(x + 8) (for enemies) + 5(y + 3) (for berries) + 30(z + 4) (for time).

Simplifying Ava's score, we get 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30z + 120.

Combining like terms, Ava's score is 10x + 5y + 30z + 195.

Now, let's find the difference between their scores. We subtract Emma's score from Ava's score:

(10x + 5y + 30z + 195) - (10x + 5y + 30z) = 195.

So, the difference between their scores is 195.

The final answer is: $\boxed{195}$"
"Let's figure out how much the other two pizzas cost. We know that two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so that's a total of 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much the other two pizzas cost. We know that all four pizzas together cost 64 dollars. So, we subtract the cost of the two pizzas we already know from the total cost of all four pizzas.

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Total cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Total cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60 = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each of the other two pizzas = 4 / 2 = 2 dollars

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond. He went to the pet store and bought some more fish. The pet store had a mixed tank with both white and orange fish. When Bob got home, he added the new fish to his pond and found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's say the number of white fish Bob bought is W. Since he bought a total of 17 fish, the number of orange fish he bought is 17 - W.

After adding the new fish, Bob had 3 + (17 - W) orange fish and 4 + W white fish. We know that he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, so we can set up the equation:

3 + (17 - W) = 2(4 + W)

Simplify the equation:

3 + 17 - W = 8 + 2W

Combine like terms:

20 - W = 8 + 2W

Add W to both sides:

20 = 8 + 3W

Subtract 8 from both sides:

12 = 3W

Divide both sides by 3:

4 = W

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to know a few things. First, we need to know how far he drives each day and how much gas his car uses per mile.

The distance between Andy's home and office is 5 miles, and he drives this distance twice a day (to and from work), so the total daily distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we need to know how much gas his car uses per mile. We are told that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon (MPG). This means that for every 10 miles he drives, he uses 1 gallon of gas.

So, to find out how much gas he uses per week, we divide the total weekly distance by his car's fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week ÷ 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we need to know the price of gas, which is $3 per gallon. To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we multiply the amount of gas he uses per week by the price of gas: 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Carrie got 10 twenties and 140 quarters from her aunt. First, we need to find out how much money she got in total. 

The value of the twenties is 10 x $20 = $200. The value of the quarters is 140 x $0.25 = $35. 

To find the total amount of money she got, we add the value of the twenties and the quarters: $200 + $35 = $235.

Now, we need to find out how much money she spent. She spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. To find 3/5 of the twenties, we multiply $200 by 3/5: 3/5 x $200 = $120.

So, Carrie spent $35 + $120 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"Let's count the fruits that Ricardo can get from his plants. We need to find out how many tomatoes and eggplants he can get.

For tomatoes, we multiply the number of tomato plants by the number of tomatoes each plant gives. There are 5 tomato plants and each plant gives 22 tomatoes. So, we multiply 5 and 22.

5 x 22 = 110

For eggplants, we do the same thing. There are 8 eggplant plants and each plant gives 4 eggplants. So, we multiply 8 and 4.

8 x 4 = 32

Now, we add the number of tomatoes and eggplants together to find the total number of fruits.

110 + 32 = 142

The final answer is: 142"
"Let's figure out how many OLED TVs Samwell sold. We know that one-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs. 

To find one-fourth of 40, we multiply 40 by 1/4. That's the same as 40 * 0.25. So, 40 * 0.25 = 10 smart TVs.

To find one-eighth of 40, we multiply 40 by 1/8. That's the same as 40 * 0.125. So, 40 * 0.125 = 5 analog TVs.

Now, we add the number of smart TVs and analog TVs together: 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"So, John is trying to raise money for a school trip. The school is going to help him out by paying for half of the trip. The trip costs $300. To find out how much the school will pay, we need to divide the total cost by 2.

$300 ÷ 2 = $150

This means the school will pay $150. John already has $50. To find out how much more money he needs, we need to subtract the amount he has from the amount the school will pay.

$150 - $50 = $100

So, John is missing $100."
"So, Carson's pipes will freeze if it gets below 32 degrees. We need to figure out how many logs he needs to burn to keep it from getting that cold. 

First, we need to know the temperature at night. It's 33 degrees colder than during the day, which was 45 degrees. So, we subtract 33 from 45 to get the night temperature: 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Now, we need to find out how much warmer it needs to be to prevent the pipes from freezing. We subtract the night temperature from the freezing point: 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs, we divide the temperature difference by the heat each log provides: 20 ÷ 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of seashells, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

First, we need to find out how many groups were formed. We know that there are 90 people and each group has 9 people. 

Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 ÷ 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we need to find out how many groups brought back seashells. We know that 3 out of 5 groups brought back seashells. 

Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we need to find the total number of seashells. We know that each group that brought back seashells had 2 seashells.

Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many people are on the train, we need to do some simple math. 

First, we start with 172 people on the train. Then, 47 people get off at the first stop. To find out how many people are left, we subtract 47 from 172:

172 - 47 = 125

Now, 13 people get on the train at the first stop. To find out how many people are on the train now, we add 13 to 125:

125 + 13 = 138

Next, 38 people get off at the next stop. To find out how many people are left, we subtract 38 from 138:

138 - 38 = 100

So, there are 100 people on the train.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the value of each bottle cap and then multiply the result by the number of days in the month.

First, let's multiply the number of bottle caps per day by the value of each bottle cap:

10 bottle caps/day × $0.25/bottle cap = $2.50/day

Now, we multiply the daily amount by the number of days in the month:

$2.50/day × 30 days = $75

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"Let's figure out how much Jamie earned last Tuesday. She works 8 hours a day at $20 per hour. That's 8 x $20 = $160. 

If she works more than 8 hours, she gets paid $30 per hour. She worked 11 hours that day, so she worked 3 extra hours. 3 x $30 = $90. 

To find out her total earnings, we add the money she made from the 8 hours and the 3 extra hours. $160 + $90 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs.

First, we know there are 12 female lions. 
Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can find the number of male lions by dividing the number of female lions by 2: 12 ÷ 2 = 6 male lions.
We also know there are 14 lion cubs.

Now, we can add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions: 12 + 6 + 14 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"So, Mike wants to buy a pair of jeans that originally costs $40. But, they're on sale for 25% off. That means he'll get 25% of $40 off the price. To find 25% of $40, I'll multiply 0.25 by 40.

0.25 × 40 = $10

So, the discount is $10. Now, I'll subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price.

$40 - $10 = $30

Now, Mike is going to pay with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he'll have left over, I'll subtract the sale price from the $50 bill.

$50 - $30 = $20

So, Mike will have $20 left over.

The final answer is: $20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. We need to find out how many employees they have after 3 months.

200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) = 220 employees
220 + 20 (hired in the second month) = 240 employees
240 + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

So, after 3 months, the company has 260 employees.

Each employee gets paid $4000 per month. To find the total amount of money the company pays every month, we multiply the number of employees by the salary per employee:
200 employees * $4000 = $800,000 per month
240 employees * $4000 = $960,000 per month
260 employees * $4000 = $1,040,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, we need to add the total amount paid for 3 months:
$800,000 + $960,000 = $1,760,000
$1,760,000 + $1,040,000 = $2,800,000

The final answer is: $2,800,000"
"To find the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, and they're going to sing it twice, so we multiply 150 by 2. That's 2 x 150 = 300 seconds.

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long. 

Now, we add the time for ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells"" together. 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

The final answer is: 540"
"Let's figure out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally.

Billy was first paid $10 per hour. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new pay is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. Then, after a year, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final pay $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting pay is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting pay, so she makes $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much they earn in 20 hours:

Billy's earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we need to calculate the cost of each and then subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread.

First, let's find the cost of 3 loaves of bread. Since each loaf costs $2, we multiply 3 x $2 = $6.

Next, we find the cost of 2 bagels. Since each bagel costs $1, we multiply 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the bread and the bagels. To do this, we subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find Nikita's score, we need to find half of Pierson's score and add 11. 

Pierson scored 278 points. Half of 278 is 278 ÷ 2 = 139. 
Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

To find the total score, we add Pierson's score and Nikita's score: 278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"So, let's figure out how many trees Ashley's school will plant. We know there are 40 classes, and each class has 25 students and 3 teachers. 

First, we need to find out how many students there are in total. We can do this by multiplying the number of classes by the number of students in each class.

40 classes * 25 students/class = 40 * 25 = 1000 students

Now, we know each student plants 1 tree, so we multiply the total number of students by 1.

1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

Next, we need to find out how many teachers there are in total. We can do this by multiplying the number of classes by the number of teachers in each class.

40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 40 * 3 = 120 teachers

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, we multiply the total number of teachers by 2.

120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Now, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers to get the total number of trees planted.

1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals she has. 

First, let's find the total number of stuffed animals she has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of 14. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30%, so we will round to the nearest whole number that will make the percentage 30% or more. 

To find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy, we can set up the equation: 

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3: 

14 + x = 100

However, this is not the correct equation. We need to set up the equation as follows:

"To find out how many hours Kris needs to play to earn the achievement, we need to know how many hours she has already played and how many hours she needs to play in total.

First, let's figure out how many hours Kris played in 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 x 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

Next, let's find out how many hours Kris played in 1 week. There are 7 days in 1 week. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 x 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Now, we add the hours Kris played in 2 weeks and 1 week: 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's figure out how far apart the two cars will be after 2 hours.

We know that the first car is going 60 miles per hour, and the second car is going 70 miles per hour. To find out how far each car will travel in 2 hours, we multiply their speeds by 2.

The first car will travel 60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles.

The second car will travel 70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles.

Now, we need to find out how far apart they are. To do that, we subtract the distance the first car traveled from the distance the second car traveled.

140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart.

The final answer is: 20"
"So James bought a ring for his bride-to-be. The diamond cost $600 and the gold cost $300. He paid a 30% extra for it to be made. Let's find out how much he paid in total.

First, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold. That's $600 + $300 = $900.

Now, we need to find 30% of $900. To do that, we multiply $900 by 0.3. That's 0.3 × $900 = $270.

Now, we add the 30% extra to the total cost of the diamond and gold. That's $900 + $270 = $1170.

So, James paid $1170 for the ring.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to know how many students passed and how many students there are in total.

First, let's find out how many students passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of fourth-graders, and 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, the pass rate for fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. So, 80 out of 400 fifth-graders passed.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460

Next, let's find the total number of students:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To find out how long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to know how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, we need to find out how many chips he has in total. 

2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with 144 chips. 

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we need to find out how many inches long it can be. 

We know that the area of a rectangle (such as the mosaic) is length * width. Since we know the area (12 square inches) and the height (3 inches), we can find the length.

Area = length * width
12 = length * 3
length = 12 / 3
length = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's figure out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party.

We know that 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea each, so we multiply 4 by 1.5 to find out how much tea they drank in total. That's 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts.

Then, 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea each, so we multiply 16 by 2 to find out how much tea they drank in total. That's 16 x 2 = 32 quarts.

Now, we add the tea that the first group of students drank to the tea that the second group of students drank. That's 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left, so we add that to the 38 quarts that were drank. That's 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we divide 48 by 4 to find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party. That's 48 ÷ 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's figure out how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell.

Dale started with 100 candies. He sold 150, but that's not possible because you can't sell more candies than you have. So, he must have ordered more to replace the ones he sold.

Dale ordered 100 more candies. Now, he has 100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200 candies.

Since he sold 150 candies, we need to subtract that from the total number of candies he has. 200 - 150 = 50.

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies.

The final answer is: 50"
"So, let's figure this out. We start with 10 students at the beginning of the year. Every month, the number of students doubles. We need to find out how many more students join by the end of May.

Let's count the number of times the students double:

- January: 10 students
- February: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

Now, we need to find out how many more students joined. We do this by subtracting the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 160 - 10 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the money he made by how much each branch costs. 

Let's do the math:

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made ÷ Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 ÷ $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked 5 days, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed ÷ Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 ÷ 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's count the petals on the flowers Rose picked. She picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each. That's 3 x 5 = 15 petals. Then, she picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each. That's 4 x 6 = 24 petals. Next, she picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each. That's 5 x 4 = 20 petals. Finally, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each. That's 6 x 7 = 42 petals.

Now, let's add up all the petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals. But, she dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, so we need to subtract 4 petals from the total. 101 - 4 = 97 petals.

The final answer is: 97"
"Let's figure out how many S'mores each kid can have.

First, we need to find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag. We know that there are 35 marshmallows in the bag. John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so they used a total of 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

Total marshmallows in the bag = 35
Marshmallows used by John and DeSean = 18
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 + 3 = 21
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Now, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have.

Total marshmallows left = 14
Number of kids = 2
S'mores each kid can have = 14 ÷ 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how long each person played the game. Jack played for 4 hours, which is 4 x 60 = 240 minutes. 

Two of his friends are worse than him, so they played for half the time, which is 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each. 

The other friend is better than Jack, so they played for 1.5 times the time, which is 240 x 1.5 = 360 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time played: 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is $0.05.

To find the total amount of money used, we multiply the total time played by the cost per minute: 840 x $0.05 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"Let's figure out how much oil Tanya uses to make her salt scrub.

We know that Tanya makes a 10-ounce jar of scrub. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. She also uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

Let's say the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) is x. Then the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much money John spent at the market, we need to add up the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows.

First, let's find the cost of the goats. John bought 3 goats for $500 each. To find the total cost of the goats, we multiply the number of goats by the cost of each goat: 3 x $500 = $1500.

Next, let's find the cost of the cows. John bought 2 cows for $1500 each. To find the total cost of the cows, we multiply the number of cows by the cost of each cow: 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

First, let's add up the cupcakes Paul already has: 8 chocolate cupcakes + 40 toffee cupcakes = 48 cupcakes.

Now, we need to subtract 48 from the total number of cupcakes Paul needs: 63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Robert has 20 cars, so Joe has 2 x 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2. That's 40 x 0.2 = 8 cars.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 x 8 = 16 cars.

In total, Joe gives away 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's figure out how much each student raised for the charity. We know that the charity raised a total of $175,000. But $50,000 of that came from organizations, so we need to subtract that from the total to find out how much the students raised.

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now, we need to divide the amount the students raised ($125,000) by the number of students (20) to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

So, each student raised $6,250 for the charity."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to add the time she walked on the first day and the second day.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert 8 hours to minutes by multiplying 8 by 60.

8 hours = 8 × 60 = 480 minutes

On the second day, Sandy walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day. Since she walked 8 hours on the first day, she walked 8 ÷ 2 = 4 hours on the second day. We can convert 4 hours to minutes by multiplying 4 by 60.

4 hours = 4 × 60 = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time from the first day and the second day to find the total time.

Total time = 480 minutes + 240 minutes
Total time = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"Let's figure out how many cars Hunter counted during the lunch break.

First, we need to find out how many cars were in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class for the lunch break. We know that there were 50 cars initially, and 20 more cars arrived during the first break. So, we add 50 and 20 to get the total number of cars.

50 + 20 = 70

Now, we know that 1/2 of the cars left the parking lot. To find out how many cars left, we multiply 70 by 1/2.

70 × 1/2 = 35

This means 35 cars left the parking lot. To find out how many cars were left when Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, we subtract 35 from 70.

70 - 35 = 35

So, there were 35 cars in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class for the lunch break. This is the number of cars he counted during the lunch break.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to know how much he makes in a day and then multiply that by 7.

John does 30 cycles of work a day. Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. 

First, we multiply the number of cycles by the number of tasks in each cycle: 30 * 5 = 150 tasks per day.

Then, we multiply the number of tasks by the pay per task: 150 tasks * $1.20/task = $180 per day.

Now, we multiply the daily earnings by 7 to find out how much John makes in a week: $180 * 7 = $1260.

The final answer is: $1260"
"Let's figure out how many points Sasha scored in the two basketball games.

In the first game, Sasha's team was at home, and she scored 14 points. Her friend Julie scored 4 points less than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

Now, let's think about the second game. Sasha's team was at Julie's home court, and Sasha didn't do very well. She scored 6 points less than what Julie scored in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's figure out how many more tins of cat food Kimberly bought than dog food.

First, we need to find out how many tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package has 11 tins. To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 8 × 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

Next, we need to find out how many tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package has 6 tins. To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 6 × 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food. To do this, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have a total of 341 cards. We also know that Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, and Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.

Let's say PJ has x cards. Then Smendrick has 3x cards because he has 3 times as many cards as PJ. Becca has 3x + 12 cards because she has 12 more cards than Smendrick.

The total number of cards is the sum of the cards each person has, so we can write the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: 147"
"Let's figure out how many eggs Cindy has. We know she has 5 green eggs. Then, she has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has 2 x 5 = 10 blue eggs. Next, she has 1 fewer pink egg than blue eggs, which means she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. Finally, she has 1/3 as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has 9 ÷ 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

To find the total number of eggs, we need to add the number of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's find the cost of shipping. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles. So, the cost of shipping is:

Cost of shipping = (0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20)
= 1.4 + 1.6
= $2.99

Now, let's find the refund amount. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32. So, the refund amount is:

Refund amount = 0.75 * 32
= $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:

Total loss = Cost of shipping + (Purchase price - Refund amount)
= 2.99 + (32 - 24)
= 2.99 + 8
= $10.99

The final answer is: $10.99"
"Let's figure out how much money Mulan has left.

First, we need to know how much money Mulan had initially. Her father gave her $100, and she already had $40, so she now has $100 + $40 = $140.

Next, we need to find out how much money she spent. She bought two pairs of jeans for $30 each, so that's 2 x $30 = $60. She also bought a bag for $20.

To find the total amount of money she spent, we add the cost of the jeans and the bag: $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, we subtract the total amount of money she spent from the total amount of money she had initially: $140 - $80 = $60.

So, Mulan has $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's figure out how much chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week.

Boris makes 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. In the first week, he makes 8,000 bars. In the second week, he makes half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. In the third week, he makes three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find out how much he makes in the fourth week, we need to add up the chocolate he made in the first three weeks and subtract that from the total amount he makes in a month.

First, let's add up the chocolate he made in the first three weeks:
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000

Now, let's subtract that from the total amount he makes in a month:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

So, Boris makes 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.

"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends per week and multiply it by 4.

First, let's find out how much time Britany spends on writing songs per week. She spends 2 hours, which is equal to 2 x 60 = 120 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how much time Britany spends on makeup per week. She does her makeup for 15 minutes, 6 days a week. So, 15 x 6 = 90 minutes.

Now, let's calculate how much time Britany spends recording videos per week. She records 18 videos, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, 18 x 4 = 72 minutes.

Now, let's add up all the time Britany spends on TikTok per week: 120 minutes (songs) + 90 minutes (makeup) + 72 minutes (videos) = 282 minutes.

To make it easier to understand, let's convert the total weekly time to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 282 minutes ÷ 60 = 4.7 hours.

Finally, let's multiply the total weekly time by 4 to find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month: 4.7 hours x 4 = 18.8 hours.

The final answer is: 18.8"
"So, Angela wants to know how much it will cost to have some stuff installed by an interior design firm. They charge $129 for a basic installation, which includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. Angela has some extra stuff she wants installed: 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.

First, we need to figure out how many extra items Angela has. We subtract the number of items already included in the basic installation from the number of items Angela has:

Extra mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2
Extra chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1
Extra pictures: 20 - 10 = 10

Now, we need to find out how much it will cost to install these extra items. The firm charges $15 for each extra item. So, we multiply the number of extra items by the cost per item:

Extra mirrors: 2 * $15 = $30
Extra chandeliers: 1 * $15 = $15
Extra pictures: 10 * $15 = $150

Now, we add up the cost of the extra items: $30 + $15 + $150 = $195.

Finally, we add the cost of the basic installation to the cost of the extra items: $129 + $195 = $324.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"Let's figure out how much money Roy has saved.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Then, we know that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. So, Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we need to find out how much more money Roy has saved than Anthony. It says that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4. That's $30.00 × 0.4 = $12.00.

To find the total amount Roy has saved, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to figure out how high each person can lift it. We know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Saskay can lift 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12.

480 ÷ 12 = 40 feet.

"To find the total distance Mason traveled, we need to know how far he went in the first part of his trip and the second part of his trip. 

First, we need to find the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours. We know he was going 8 miles per hour, so we multiply 8 miles per hour by 4 hours. 

8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

Then, we need to find the distance he traveled in the next 6 hours. We know he was still going 8 miles per hour, so we multiply 8 miles per hour by 6 hours.

8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, we add the two distances together to find the total distance.

32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that three kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours. To find out how long it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway, we need to multiply the time it takes for three kangaroos by 3. 

So, 3 kangaroos * 18 hours = 54 hours for 1 kangaroo.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means it will take them twice as long to travel across the highway. To find the time it takes for four turtles, we multiply the time it takes for one kangaroo by 2 and then by 4.

So, 54 hours * 2 * 4 = 432 hours.

The final answer is: 432"
"To find out how many clay dishes Jada, Rory, and Kora made together, we need to know how many each of them made. 

Kora made 20 dishes. Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. 

Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 x 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we add up the number of dishes each person made to find the total number of dishes they made together: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

"Let's figure out how much money Erika has in her purse. 

First, we need to know how much the new laptop costs after she trades in her old one. The new laptop costs $600, and if she trades it in, the price goes down by $200. So, the new price is: $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika got paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gave her $80. So, she got a total of $150 + $80 = $230.

We know that Erika needs $50 more to buy the laptop. This means she already has $400 (the price of the laptop after trading in her old one) + $50 (the extra money she needs) = $450.

Since Erika got $230, we need to subtract that from $450 to find out how much money she had in her purse initially: $450 - $230 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"Let's figure out how many apple slices are left.

First, we need to find out how many slices Adam has in total. We know that 3 large apples can be sliced into 5 pieces each, and 5 small apples can be sliced into 3 pieces each.

To find the total number of slices from the large apples, we multiply 3 (number of large apples) by 5 (number of slices per large apple): 3 x 5 = 15 slices.

To find the total number of slices from the small apples, we multiply 5 (number of small apples) by 3 (number of slices per small apple): 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Now, we add the number of slices from the large apples and the small apples: 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so we need to subtract 15 from the total number of slices: 30 - 15 = 15.

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to know how much milk each cow produces. The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow. 

We need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To do this, we can divide 25 by 5.

25 ÷ 5 = 5

This means the farmer needs 5 cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to have 5 cows in total.

5 (total cows needed) - 3 (cows already have) = 2

The farmer needs 2 more cows to have 5 cows and produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

First, let's find the unused portion of the first glue stick. Since it has 1/6 left, we multiply 12 millimeters by 1/6.

12 mm × (1/6) = 12 mm × 1 ÷ 6
= 12 mm × 1 ÷ 6
= 12 ÷ 6 mm
= 2 mm

Next, let's find the unused portion of the second glue stick. Since it has 2/3 left, we multiply 12 millimeters by 2/3.

12 mm × (2/3) = 12 mm × 2 ÷ 3
= 12 mm × 2 ÷ 3
= 24 ÷ 3 mm
= 8 mm

Now, let's find the unused portion of the third glue stick. Since it has 1/2 left, we multiply 12 millimeters by 1/2.

12 mm × (1/2) = 12 mm × 1 ÷ 2
= 12 mm × 1 ÷ 2
= 12 ÷ 2 mm
= 6 mm

Now, we add the unused portions together: 
2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to add up the cost of the things he wants to buy and then subtract the money he already has.

The car costs $10000 and the phone costs $800. To find the total cost, we add these two numbers together: $10000 + $800 = $10080.

Gabriel has $5000 from working and his brother gave him $200. We add these two numbers together to find out how much money he has: $5000 + $200 = $5200.

Now, we subtract the money Gabriel has from the total cost of the things he wants to buy: $10080 - $5200 = $4880.

So, Gabriel still needs $4880."
"To find the change, we need to subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount Thea gave the craftsman. 

First, let's calculate the total amount Thea gave the craftsman: 4 x $20 = $80

Now, let's subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount: $80 - $70 = $10

Thea got $10 as change."
"Let's figure out how much money Craig has left.

Craig has 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 x $20 = $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.

He buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

To find the total amount he spent, we add the cost of squirt guns and water balloons: $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

So, Craig has $19 left.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's figure out how many socks and dishes Peter and Jack have together.

We know that Jack has 60 dishes. Since Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, we can find out how many socks he has by dividing the number of dishes by 2.

60 ÷ 2 = 30

So, Jack has 30 socks.

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. To find out how many socks Peter has, we multiply the number of socks Jack has by 2.

30 × 2 = 60

So, Peter has 60 socks.

We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. To find out how many dishes Peter has, we divide the number of dishes Jack has by 2.

60 ÷ 2 = 30

So, Peter has 30 dishes.

Now, let's add up the number of socks and dishes they both have.

Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

Total number of socks and dishes together = 90 + 90 = 180"
"There are 20 students in Miss Susan's class. 5 of them are good at math only, 8 of them perform well in English only, and the rest are good at both math and English. To find out how many students are good at math, we need to add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both math and English.

Let's find out how many students are good at both math and English. We know that there are 20 students in total, and 5 are good at math only and 8 are good at English only. So, the number of students who are good at both is 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7.

Now, we add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both math and English. This will give us the total number of students who are good at math. So, 5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"So, Vicki is planning a concert at her high school. The concert will be 2 hours long, which is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes. But, there's a 10-minute break in the middle, so we need to subtract that from the total time. That leaves us with 120 - 10 = 110 minutes for the performances.

Each group gets 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to get off the stage. That's a total of 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes per group.

To find out how many groups can perform, we need to divide the total time available for performances (110 minutes) by the time each group takes (10 minutes). That's 110 ÷ 10 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find out how much money Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to know the interest rate and the original amount she invested. The interest rate is 3/4 of the original amount, which is $300. To find 3/4 of $300, we multiply 300 by 3 and then divide by 4.

3/4 of $300 = (3 * 300) / 4
= 900 / 4
= $225

So, Brenda earns $225 in interest each year. To find the total amount after 1 year, we add the interest to the original amount:

$300 (initial investment) + $225 (interest) = $525

To find the total amount after 2 years, we add the interest to the previous total:

$525 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $750

To find the total amount after 3 years, we add the interest to the previous total:

$750 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $975

The final answer is: $975"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. We need to find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons are there than white shirts with no collars.

First, let's find out how many white shirts have collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, we can divide 40 by 2 to get the number of white shirts with collars. 

40 ÷ 2 = 20

So, 20 white shirts have collars. To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we subtract 20 from 40.

40 - 20 = 20

Now, let's find out how many floral shirts have buttons. We are given that 20 floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract 20 from 50.

50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

30 - 20 = 10

"Let's figure out how much money the farmer will get from selling the eggs.

First, we need to find out how many trays the farmer has. We know he has 900 eggs and each tray can hold 30 eggs. To find the number of trays, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray.

Number of trays = Total number of eggs ÷ Number of eggs per tray
= 900 ÷ 30
= 30

Now, we know the farmer has 30 trays. Each tray costs $2.5. To find out how much money the farmer will get, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray.

Earnings = Number of trays × Price per tray
= 30 × $2.5
= $75

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's figure out how many goats are left in the two farms.

First, we need to find out how many goats are left in Farm X. Mr. Smith started with 55 goats in Farm X and sold 10 goats. To find the number of goats left, we subtract 10 from 55.

55 - 10 = 45

So, there are 45 goats left in Farm X.

Next, we need to find out how many goats are left in Farm Y. Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold 2 x 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y.

Now, we need to find the number of goats left in Farm Y. Mr. Smith started with 45 goats in Farm Y and sold 20 goats. To find the number of goats left, we subtract 20 from 45.

45 - 20 = 25

So, there are 25 goats left in Farm Y.

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y.

45 + 25 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to know how many pairs he buys in a year and how much he spends in total.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. Since there are 12 months in a year, he buys 2 x 12 = 24 pairs of shoes in a year.

Now, let's divide the total amount he spends on shoes in a year ($2640) by the number of pairs he buys in a year (24):

$2640 ÷ 24 = $110

So, James pays $110 on average for each pair of shoes.

The final answer is: $110"
"Let's figure out how much you'll have to pay for 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food.

First, we need to find the cost of 3 baskets of green food. Since each basket costs $25, we multiply 3 by 25.

3 x $25 = $75

Next, we need to find the cost of 3 baskets of red food. Since each basket costs $18, we multiply 3 by 18.

3 x $18 = $54

Now, we add the cost of the green food and the red food together to get the total cost before the discount.

$75 + $54 = $129

But, we get a discount of $2 for each basket of red food. Since we bought 3 baskets of red food, we get a discount of 3 x $2 = $6.

So, we subtract the discount from the total cost.

$129 - $6 = $123

The final answer is: $123"
"To find out how long it takes to clean half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we need to know how many rooms that is and how long it takes to clean each one.

There are 90 rooms at the motel. Half of 90 is 45 rooms. To find half of 90, we can divide 90 by 2.

90 ÷ 2 = 45

It takes 20 minutes to clean each room. To find the total time it takes to clean 45 rooms, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms × 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes ÷ 60 = 15 hours

So, it would take 15 hours to clean half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to do some math.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. To find three times 12, we multiply 12 by 3: 12 × 3 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will count how many homes they have built in the first two years and double that amount. First, we add the number of homes built in the first two years: 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, we double this amount: 2 × 48 = 96 homes.

Now, we add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's say my age is x. My brother is 3 years older than me, so his age is x + 3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x + 8 - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 8x + 17 = 87.

Subtract 17 from both sides: 8x = 70.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 8.75.

Since age cannot be a decimal, we need to try another approach. Let's try to find a whole number solution.

Let's try x = 9. If x = 9, then my brother's age is 9 + 3 = 12, my sister's age is 9 - 2 = 7, and my mom's age is 3(12) - 1 = 35.

The sum of our ages is 9 + 12 + 7 + 35 = 63, which is less than 87. Let's try a higher number.

Let's try x = 10. If x = 10, then my brother's age is 10 + 3 = 13, my sister's age is 10 - 2 = 8, and my mom's age is 3(13) - 1 = 38.

The sum of our ages is 10 + 13 + 8 + 38 = 69, which is still less than 87. Let's try a higher number.

Let's try x = 11. If x = 11, then my brother's age is 11 + 3 = 14, my sister's age is 11 - 2 = 9, and my mom's age is 3(14) - 1 = 41.

The sum of our ages is 11 + 14 + 9 + 41 = 75, which is still less than 87. Let's try a higher number.

Let's try x = 12. If x = 12, then my brother's age is 12 + 3 = 15, my sister's age is 12 - 2 = 10, and my mom's age is 3(15) - 1 = 44.

The sum of our ages is 12 + 15 + 10 + 44 = 81, which is still less than 87. Let's try a higher number.

Let's try x = 13. If x = 13, then my brother's age is 13 + 3 = 16, my sister's age is 13 - 2 = 11, and my mom's age is 3(16) - 1 = 47.

The sum of our ages is 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87.

So, the correct answer is 13.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to figure out how many glue sticks are needed in total. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply 27 by 2.

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Now, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Each pack has 8 glue sticks. To do this, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack.

54 glue sticks ÷ 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's figure out the total amount of water passing through the river. 

First, we know that the river has 4000 gallons of water on the first day. 

On the second day, the amount of water doubles, so we multiply 4000 by 2 to get 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water increases by 6000 gallons, so we add 6000 to 8000 to get 14000 gallons.

Now, we need to add up the water from all three days: 4000 + 8000 + 14000. 

To do this, we can add 4000 and 8000 first, which is 12000. Then, we add 14000 to that, which is 26000.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 26000 gallons.

The final answer is: 26000"
"Let's figure out how many people are infected after three days.

We know that 10 people are infected at first. Each of these people infects 6 others every day. So, on the first day, 10 * 6 = 60 new people get infected. That's a total of 70 people infected.

On the second day, the 60 people who got infected on the first day infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people. The 10 people who were infected at first also infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people. So, that's a total of 490 people infected.

On the third day, the 360 people who got infected on the second day infect 360 * 6 = 2160 new people. The 60 people who got infected on the first day infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people. And the 10 people who were infected at first infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people. So, that's a total of 3070 people infected.

"Let's figure out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips.

Rafaela got tips from 40 customers, and each customer gave her $20. So, we multiply 40 by $20 to find out how much money Rafaela got in tips.

40 × $20 = $800

Now, we need to find out how much money Julieta got in tips. We know that Julieta got 10% less money than Rafaela. To find 10% of $800, we multiply $800 by 0.1.

0.1 × $800 = $80

Since Julieta got 10% less than Rafaela, we subtract $80 from $800 to find out how much money Julieta got in tips.

$800 - $80 = $720

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they both got in tips. We add the money Rafaela got to the money Julieta got.

$800 + $720 = $1520

The final answer is: $1520"
"Let's solve the problem. Jennifer bought 12 oranges from the market. She gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. She also gave her son 3 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges Jennifer gave away in total, we add the oranges given to her daughters and her son: 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, we need to find out how many oranges Jennifer has left. We subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges: 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

"Let's figure out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge, so she earns half a badge every month. Wendy earns three times as many badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 badges every month.

To find out how many badges each person earns in a year, we multiply the number of badges they earn per month by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

Claire earns 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
Amber earns 0.5 badges/month * 12 months = 6 badges
Wendy earns 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

Now, let's find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber. We subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

"Let's figure out how much money Paige raised for her fundraiser.

First, we need to find out how many slices of banana bread she baked. She baked for 5 hours, and she can bake 2 loaves per hour. So, she baked 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Now, we need to find out how much money she made from selling those slices. Each slice costs 50 cents, and there are 100 cents in a dollar. So, we can convert the price per slice to dollars by dividing 50 cents by 100 cents. That's 50/100 = 0.5 dollars per slice.

To find the total amount of money she made, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * 0.5 dollars/slice = 40 dollars.

"Let's solve the problem. We know that Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she has 70 gold coins, we need to find out how many silver coins she has.

Let's call the number of silver coins ""S"" and the number of gold coins ""G"". We know that G = S + 30 and G = 70.

Since G = S + 30 and G = 70, we can set up the equation S + 30 = 70.

To find S, we need to get S by itself on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:

S + 30 - 30 = 70 - 30
S = 40

Now that we know S = 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins:

Total coins = S + G
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

"Let's figure out how many yellow cars the bumper car rink has. 

We know the rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we add up the number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"Let's solve the problem together.

We know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have a total of 85 books. We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's use variables to represent the number of books each person has. Let F be the number of books Fawn has, A be the number of books Anne has, and S be the number of books Sofie has.

We can write two equations based on the information we have:

1. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
2. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can also write an equation for the total number of books:

S + A + F = 85

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the total equation:

(A + 25) + A + F = 85

Combine like terms:

2A + F + 25 = 85

Now, substitute the second equation into this equation:

2(F - 12) + F + 25 = 85

Expand the equation:

2F - 24 + F + 25 = 85

Combine like terms:

3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

F = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots Daisy bought, we need to know how much the sweet potatoes and carrots weigh. The potatoes weigh 5 pounds. The sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, so they weigh 2 x 5 = 10 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how much the carrots weigh. We know the sweet potatoes weigh 10 pounds, and the carrots weigh 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes. So, we subtract 3 from 10 to find the weight of the carrots: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To find out how much Greg will spend on Jello, we need to know how many boxes of Jello he needs to buy. Since each box makes 10 Jello cups and he wants each kid to have 4 Jello cups, we need to multiply the number of kids by the number of Jello cups each kid will get. 

30 kids * 4 Jello cups/kid = 120 Jello cups

Now, we need to find out how many boxes of Jello Greg needs to buy. Since each box makes 10 Jello cups, we divide the total number of Jello cups by 10.

120 Jello cups / 10 Jello cups/box = 12 boxes

Now that we know Greg needs 12 boxes of Jello, we can find out how much he will spend. Each box costs $1.25, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box.

12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

First, we need to find out how much the phones cost in total. We know the seller bought 5 phones for $700 each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of phones by the price of each phone: 

5 phones * $700 = $3500

Now, we know the seller gave the seller $4000 in dollar bills. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given: 

$4000 - $3500 = $500

So, the seller will get $500 in change.

"Let's figure out how much Keenan spends on groceries per week. 

First, we need to find out how much Keenan spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays 40% of the cost. To find 40% of $400, we multiply 0.4 by 400.

0.4 x 400 = $160

Now, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so we divide $160 by 4.

$160 ÷ 4 = $40

So, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries.

So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find out how many pieces that is, we multiply 7/13 by 26.

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13

Let's start with the soda. If 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, we can find the cost of one bottle by dividing $21.00 by 7. That's $21.00 ÷ 7 = $3.00 per bottle.

Now, let's do the same for the water. If 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, we can find the cost of one bottle by dividing $8.00 by 4. That's $8.00 ÷ 4 = $2.00 per bottle.

Now that we know the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

3 bottles of soda cost 3 x $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water cost 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
The total cost is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To find out how much money David has left, we need to subtract the cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the bolts:
16 bolts * $0.03 per bolt = $0.48

Now, let's subtract the cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

So, David has $12.00 left after buying the bolts."
"To find out how much Ella will earn after walking dogs for 12 hours, we need to know how much she earns per hour. We can do this by dividing the amount she earned ($33) by the number of hours she worked (3).

$33 ÷ 3 hours = $11 per hour

Now, we can multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she will work (12) to find out how much she will earn.

$11 per hour × 12 hours = $132

So, Ella will earn $132 after walking dogs for 12 hours.

The final answer is: $132"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Paul starts with 52 marbles. His friend gives him 28 more marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

To find out how many marbles he lost, we need to find 1/4 of 80. To do this, we can multiply 80 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 80 by 4.

80 ÷ 4 = 20

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. Now, we need to subtract the marbles he lost from the total marbles he had after receiving the gift: 80 - 20 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's figure out how many points Amy gets on her history test.

First, we need to find out how many points she gets from the multiple-choice questions. There are 10 of them, and she gets 80% of them right. To find 80% of 10, we multiply 10 by 0.8. That's 10 x 0.8 = 8 points.

Next, we need to find out how many points she gets from the true/false questions. There are 20 of them, and she gets 90% of them right. To find 90% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.9. That's 20 x 0.9 = 18 points.

Now, let's look at the long-answer questions. There are 5 of them, and she gets 60% of them right. To find 60% of 5, we multiply 5 by 0.6. That's 5 x 0.6 = 3 points. But remember, each long-answer question is worth 5 points, so she gets 3 x 5 = 15 points.

Now, let's add up all the points: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41.

The final answer is: 41"
"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to know how many chickens he plans to sell and how much money he will make from selling them. 

Isaias has 300 chickens and he plans to sell 3/5 of them. To find 3/5 of 300, we can multiply 300 by 3 and then divide by 5.

(300 * 3) / 5 = 180

So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens. He will sell them at $50 each, so the total amount of money he will make from selling the chickens is:

180 * $50 = $9000

We are told that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000. This means he needs to make a total of $9000 + $2000 = $11000 from selling the chickens.

Since he will make $9000 from selling the chickens, we need to find out how much he spent to buy the chickens. We can do this by subtracting the profit from the total amount he needs to make:

$11000 - $2000 = $9000

However, this is the amount he needs to make from selling the chickens, not the amount he spent to buy them. To find the cost price, we need to subtract the profit from the selling price. But we already know the selling price is $9000, and we need to find the cost price.

Let's think about it this way: if Isaias sells the chickens for $9000 and makes a profit of $2000, then the cost price is the selling price minus the profit.

Cost price = Selling price - Profit
Cost price = $9000 - $2000
Cost price = $7000

The final answer is: $7000"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses of lemonade. Julie sold 14 glasses. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses they sold by dividing the total number of glasses by 2.

32 ÷ 2 = 16

So, Micah and Mitchell each sold 16 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we need to subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

14 (Julie's glasses) - 16 (Micah's glasses) = -2

The final answer is: $\boxed{-2}$"
"To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we need to add up the costs of her hair, manicure, and pedicure.

First, we know that Iris spent $400 on her hair. 

Next, we need to find out how much she spent on her manicure. Since she spent 1/4 as much on her manicure as she did on her hair, we multiply 400 by 1/4. This is the same as dividing 400 by 4, which is 100.

Now, we need to find out how much she spent on her pedicure. Since she spent 3/4 as much on her pedicure as she did on her manicure, we multiply 100 by 3/4. This is the same as dividing 100 by 4 and then multiplying by 3. 100 divided by 4 is 25, and 25 multiplied by 3 is 75.

So, we have the costs of her hair, manicure, and pedicure: $400, $100, and $75. To find the total amount she spent, we add these numbers together: $400 + $100 + $75 = $575.

The final answer is: $575"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Sarah will get from selling the rope. We know the rope is 20 meters long and her friend is buying it for $2 per meter. To find the total amount of money, we multiply the length of the rope by the price per meter.

20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, we need to find out how much the new rope costs. The new rope is also 20 meters long, but it costs $1.5 per meter. To find the total cost, we multiply the length of the rope by the price per meter.

20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Now, we need to find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope. To do this, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount of money she got from selling the old rope.

$40 - $30 = $10

So, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope."
"Let's figure out how many years it will take for Melanie's age to be three times her current age.

We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. This means she is currently 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

We want to find out when her age will be three times her current age. Let's call the number of years it takes for her age to be three times her current age 'x'. At that time, her age will be 8 + x.

Since her age will be three times her current age, we can set up the equation: 8 + x = 3 * 8.

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

8 + x = 3 * 8
x = 3 * 8 - 8
x = 24 - 8
x = 16

So, it will take Melanie 16 years for her age to be three times her current age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to add up the cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the bacon. 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.

Next, we need to find the cost of the chicken. Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since a pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2, a pack of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4. So, 6 packets of chicken cost 6 * $4 = $24.

Now, let's find the cost of the strawberries. 3 packs of strawberries cost 3 * $4 = $12.

Finally, we need to find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, a pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2. So, 7 packs of apples cost 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, we add up the cost of all the items: $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

The answer is $5."
"So, Elaina's concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and then she does a 15-minute encore. The whole thing lasts 65 minutes. Let's call the usual concert time ""x"". 

So, the concert is 2x minutes long, and the encore is 15 minutes. We can add those together to get the total time: 2x + 15 = 65.

To find out what x is, we need to get rid of the 15. We can do that by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15, 2x = 50.

Now, we need to get x by itself. We can do that by dividing both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2, x = 25.

So, Elaina's usual concerts are 25 minutes long.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's figure out how many toys Argo has now. We know he started with 200 toys. He gave some toys to his friends. He gave 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky.

To find out how many toys he has left, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the number of toys he started with. First, let's add up the number of toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then multiply the number made on Friday by 2.

First, let's add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday: 125 + 125 = 250

Now, we need to find out how many chimichangas are made on Friday. We know that they make twice as many on Friday as they do on Tuesday and Wednesday. So, we multiply 125 by 2 to find the number of chimichangas made on Friday: 2 * 125 = 250

Now, we add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday to the number made on Friday: 250 + 250 = 500

The final answer is: 500"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that the singer has 50 microphones and 20% of them won't fit. This means 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs.

To find 80% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.8.

50 × 0.8 = 40

Since each pair has 2 microphones, we need to divide 40 by 2 to find the number of pairs.

40 ÷ 2 = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of birds, we need to count the birds in each group and add them together.

First, we know there are 6 birds nesting in the bushes. Then, 2/3 of that number of birds are flying overhead. To find 2/3 of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and divide by 3. 

6 * 2 = 12
12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 birds flying overhead. Now, let's count the birds feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24

Now, let's add the number of birds in each group: 
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"Let's figure out how many cookies were in each jar. 

First, we need to find out how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5 cookies. We can do this by subtracting 5 from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 55
Cookies eaten = 5
Cookies left = Total cookies - Cookies eaten = 55 - 5 = 50

Now, we need to divide the cookies left by the number of jars. This will tell us how many cookies were in each jar.

Number of jars = 5
Cookies per jar = Cookies left / Number of jars = 50 / 5 = 10

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar.

The final answer is: 10"

First, let's find the total number of petals on the orchids: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

Next, let's find the total number of petals on the daisies: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, let's subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"Let's figure out what percent of the plants in Mrs. Smith's garden are flowering plants.

First, we need to find out how many plants are indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we multiply 100 by 1/4. That's 100 x (1/4) = 25 indoor plants.

Now, we need to find out how many plants are left. We subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants: 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Next, we find out how many of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we multiply 75 by 2/3. That's 75 x (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants.

Now, we need to find out how many plants are flowering plants. We subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants: 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

So, 25% of the plants in Mrs. Smith's garden are flowering plants.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to know how fast the thingamabob spins. We know that the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob and it spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing 121 by 11.

Speed of thingamabob = 121 ÷ 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. The whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob, so we multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

Speed of whirligig = 5 × 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

The final answer is: 55"
"Let's figure out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day.

Ellen eats 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

We know that the total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11. We can write an equation to represent this:

2x + 6 + 3 = 11

Where 'x' is the cost of one carrot. We can combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

2x + 9 = 11

Now, we need to get 'x' by itself. To do this, we'll subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 11 - 9
2x = 2

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of 'x':

x = 2 / 2
x = 1

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. That's a lot of hours. To find out how much he makes in a week, we need to know how much he makes per hour and then multiply it by the number of hours he works.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay got raised by $2. So, now he makes $10 + $2 = $12 an hour.

To find out how many hours he works in a week, we multiply the hours he works in a day by the number of days he works in a week. That's 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. She made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. We need to find out how much she made from selling lemonade.

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times. The total number of lawns she mowed is x + 3x + 5x = 9x.

Since she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

To find y, we need to solve for x first. Since we know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, we can use that information to find x. We can set up another equation: 6 = 54x. 

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides by 54: x = 6 ÷ 54 = 1/9.

Now that we know x, we can substitute it into the equation 54x + y = 80 to find y: 54(1/9) + y = 80.

First, we multiply 54 and 1/9: 54(1/9) = 6.

Now the equation is: 6 + y = 80.

To find y, we need to subtract 6 from both sides: y = 80 - 6 = 74.

So, Tasha made $74 from selling lemonade.

The final answer is: $74"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to find Christian's weight first, then subtract 5 kg from it.

Martin's weight is 55 kg. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.

Now, we need to find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.

Finally, we need to find Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To find out how much profit John makes from renting his car, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to find out how much money John makes from renting his car. He rents it 10 times a month, and each time he rents it for 3 hours. He gets paid $25 per hour. 

To find the total amount of money he makes, we multiply the number of times he rents his car by the number of hours he rents it, and then multiply that by his hourly rate.

10 (times rented) * 3 (hours per rental) * $25 (hourly rate) = 10 * 3 * $25
= $750

Now, we need to subtract the car payment from the total amount of money he makes. His car payment is $500.

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
= $750 - $500

Susan started with 100 cookies and her husband took 4, so we subtract 4 from 100 to find out how many cookies are left. 

100 - 4 = 96 cookies

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

96 ÷ 6 = 16 cookies per nephew

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Let's figure out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

To find out how many pages Denise read in total, we add the pages she read yesterday and today: 10 + 18 = 28 pages.

Daniel didn't read any pages today, so he only read 13 pages in total.

Now, let's find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel: 28 (Denise's total) - 13 (Daniel's total) = 15.

"Let's figure out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch.

We know that the pot can fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls. Since there are 4 adults (Calvin, his wife, and 2 more adults) and 2 children, a total of 6 people will eat dinner. 

Since 4 adult's bowls is equal to 8 child's bowls, we can say that the pot can fill 8 child's bowls. 

After dinner, 4 adult bowls were used (4 adults ate), which is equal to 4 child bowls. So, 4 child bowls were used and 4 child bowls are left.

Each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, and there are 2 children. To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to divide the number of child bowls left by the number of children.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to figure out how much material is needed for the small masks and the large masks separately, and then add them together.

First, let's find out how much material is needed for the small masks. We know that 2 yards of material can make 4 small masks. So, to find out how much material is needed for one small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4 masks. That's 2 ÷ 4 = 0.5 yards per small mask.

Now, we need to find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks. We multiply the amount of material needed for one small mask by 20. That's 0.5 yards per small mask × 20 small masks = 10 yards.

Next, let's find out how much material is needed for the large masks. We know that 2.25 yards of material can make 3 large masks. So, to find out how much material is needed for one large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3 masks. That's 2.25 ÷ 3 = 0.75 yards per large mask.

Now, we need to find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks. We multiply the amount of material needed for one large mask by 8. That's 0.75 yards per large mask × 8 large masks = 6 yards.

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to know how many hours he has in a day and then subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. Harold sleeps for 10 hours, which means he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left. Then, he works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours. That leaves him with 14 - 8 = 6 hours. After that, he walks his dog for 1 hour, so we subtract 1 from 6, which is 5.

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Tim has 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes. He uses 3 blue shoeboxes and 1/3 of his red shoeboxes to go fishing.

To find out how many red shoeboxes he used, we need to calculate 1/3 of 9. 

1/3 of 9 = 9 ÷ 3 = 3

So, Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes and 3 red shoeboxes to go fishing.

Now, let's find out how many shoeboxes are left. We subtract the number of shoeboxes he used from the total number of shoeboxes he had.

First, we need to figure out Adam's age four years ago. We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Let's call Adam's age four years ago ""x"".

So, we can write the equation: (Duncan's age eight years ago) = 2 * (Adam's age four years ago)
We know that Duncan's age now is 60, so his age eight years ago was 60 - 8 = 52.

Now we can plug in the numbers: 52 = 2x
To find x, we need to divide both sides by 2: x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to 26: 26 + 4 = 30.

Now, we need to find Adam's age in 8 years. We add 8 to his current age: 30 + 8 = 38.

The final answer is: 38"
"Let's figure out how many acres the two farms have together.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. To find out how many acres Farmer Smith's farm is, we need to multiply 200 by 2 and then add 100.

200 x 2 = 400

Now, we add 100 to that: 400 + 100 = 500

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres. To find the total acres of both farms, we add 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) and 500 (Farmer Smith's farm).

200 + 500 = 700

The final answer is: 700"
"Let's figure out how much money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday.

Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. He works 8 hours a day. We need to find out how many packages he completes in 8 hours.

Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. That means he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

To find out how many packages he completes in 8 hours, we multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by 8. So, 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Now, we need to find out how much money he earns for 320 packages. Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, we multiply 320 by $0.20. That's 320 * $0.20 = $64.

So, Colby earns $64 in a typical eight-hour workday."
"So, John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes. That's like, half an hour. If he solves a normal sudoku puzzle in 45 minutes, that's 45 minutes. But an extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long as a normal one, so it takes 4 x 45 = 180 minutes.

Now, we need to figure out how many 30-minute periods are in 180 minutes. We can do this by dividing 180 by 30. That's like asking, ""If I have 180 minutes, how many groups of 30 minutes can I make?"" To do this, we divide 180 by 30.

180 ÷ 30 = 6

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water while solving an extreme sudoku puzzle."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. There are 20 red balloons, so he threw 2 x 20 = 40 pieces of bologna at the red balloons.

We also know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna. Since he threw 40 pieces at the red balloons, the number of pieces he threw at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Since he threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total number of pieces thrown at yellow balloons (18) by 3. 

18 ÷ 3 = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons.

The final answer is: 6"
"So, Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. He drives 100 miles a day for 30 days. To find out how many tune-ups he needs, we need to know how many miles he drives in total.

Let's multiply the miles he drives each day by the number of days:

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Now, we need to divide the total miles by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs:

3000 miles / 1000 = 3

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"Let's figure out how many hours Bruce works in three days.

Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday. That's the first day.

On Wednesday, he works twice as many hours as he worked on Tuesday. So, we multiply 5 hours by 2 to find out how many hours he works on Wednesday. 2 x 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than he worked on Wednesday. So, we subtract 2 hours from 10 hours. 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's figure out how much money Julia and Nadine's mom gave each of them.

First, we need to find out how much money they spent in total. They bought a cake for $11, balloons for $3, and 2 tubs of ice cream for $14. To find the total amount they spent, we add these costs together: $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since they combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we need to divide the total amount by 2. This is the same as finding half of $28. We can do this by dividing $28 by 2: $28 ÷ 2 = $14.

So, Julia and Nadine's mom gave each of them $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"Let's figure out how many pieces of fruit Kira has left. First, we need to find out how many pieces of fruit she bought in total. We can do this by adding the number of apples, bananas, and oranges.

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Now, we know that Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit. To find out how many pieces are left, we need to subtract 2 from the total number of fruits Kira bought.

14 - 2 = 12

So, Kira has 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to count how many are playing each sport and add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis. Since there are twice as many students playing volleyball, we multiply 6 by 2 to get 12 students playing volleyball.

Now, let's count the students playing soccer. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so we add those numbers together: 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, we add the number of students playing each sport: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find out how much money the class raised, we need to know how much they made from selling lollipops and how much it cost them to buy the lollipops.

First, let's find out how much money they made from selling lollipops. We know that each student sold 10 lollipops and each lollipop costs $0.8. There are 30 students in the class.

Total money made = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Price per lollipop
Total money made = 30 * 10 * $0.8
Total money made = 300 * $0.8
Total money made = $240

Next, we need to find out how much it cost them to buy the lollipops. We know that each lollipop costs $0.5 and they bought 300 lollipops.

Total cost = Number of lollipops * Cost per lollipop
Total cost = 300 * $0.5
Total cost = $150

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost from the total money made.

Profit = Total money made - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $150
Profit = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from selling lollipops.

The final answer is: $90"
"Let's count Larry's pets. He has 3 cats. Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47.

The final answer is: 47"
"To figure out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to know how many slices Abby and Josh can eat together each day. Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices in the loaf by the number of slices they eat each day to find out how many days it will last. The loaf has 24 slices, so we divide 24 by 6.

24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to figure out how many months she has been collecting shells. Since Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old, and she's now 10 years old, she's been collecting shells for 5 years.

There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply 5 years by 12 months to get the total number of months.

5 years × 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell/month.

60 months × 1 shell/month = 60 shells

So, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: 60"
"Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She puts them into 3 rows, and in each row, she makes equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea. Then, she uses the remaining cups to make 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

First, we need to find out how many cups of tea are in each row. We can do this by dividing the total number of cups by the number of rows:

27 ÷ 3 = 9 cups in each row

Since Lana makes equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also 9 ÷ 2 = 4.5. But we can't have half a cup of tea, so we need to think about how many whole cups of mint tea we can make in each row.

If we make 4 cups of mint tea in each row, then we would have 5 cups of chamomile tea in each row. The total number of mint tea cups would be 3 x 4 = 12. But we know that Lana makes a total of 15 cups of mint tea. So, this can't be the right answer.

If we make 5 cups of mint tea in each row, then we would have 4 cups of chamomile tea in each row. The total number of mint tea cups would be 3 x 5 = 15. This matches the total number of mint tea cups we know Lana makes.

So, the correct answer is 5 cups of mint tea in each row."
"Let's figure out how many berries the sloth can pick up per trip. We know it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip (down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up). Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to find out how many trips he can make in that time.

To do this, we divide the total time (8 hours) by the time it takes for one round trip (4 hours). 

8 hours / 4 hours = 2 trips

Now, we know the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours. To find out how many berries he can pick up per trip, we divide the total number of berries he wants to collect (24) by the number of trips (2).

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

So, the sloth can pick up 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much water is in the tank. Since Anthony and his dad fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, and there are 10,000 gallons of water in the pool, we divide 10,000 by 2 to get the amount of water in the tank. 

10,000 ÷ 2 = 5,000 gallons

Now, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. To find the total amount of water used, we multiply the rate by the number of days.

500 gallons/day × 6 days = 3,000 gallons

Now, we need to find out how much water is left in the tank. We subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank.

5,000 gallons - 3,000 gallons = 2,000 gallons

The final answer is: 2000"
"Let's figure out how many movies Colby can see. He gets $150 each month to spend on movies. He already saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, 8 movies on other days, and he bought 2 tubs of popcorn and 4 boxes of candy.

First, let's calculate how much money he spent:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays cost 5 x $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days cost 8 x $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn cost 2 x $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy cost 4 x $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Now, let's subtract the money he spent from his monthly budget: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday with the money he has left.

Now, let's see how much money is left for other days: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (we round down to 1 since you can't see a fraction of a movie) more movie on other days.

So, Colby can see a total of 1 (on Friday) + 1 (on other days) = 2 movies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's figure out how many calories Andrew's pastries have. 

First, we need to find out how many calories are in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. We know that a normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since the mini pastries have 1/3 of the calories of the normal ones, we can find the calories of the mini pastries by dividing the calories of the normal pastries by 3.

So, a mini cinnamon roll has 600 ÷ 3 = 200 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 450 ÷ 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we need to find out how many calories are in all the mini pastries Andrew baked. He baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 x 200 = 40,000 calories. He also baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 x 150 = 45,000 calories.

To find the total calories of all the pastries, we add the calories from the cinnamon rolls and the blueberry muffins: 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to add up all the Junebugs she removed and then divide by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 x 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

To find the total number of Junebugs, we add them all together: 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days: 378 ÷ 5 = 75.6

The average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is 75.6."
"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply their speeds by the time they traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so it traveled 60 × 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so it traveled 30 × 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls Sophie bought, we need to know how many toys she had before she bought the bouncy balls and how many toys she had after buying them. 

Let's start by adding up the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and rings she had before buying the bouncy balls. 

Number of blocks = 31
Number of stuffed animals = 8
Number of rings = 9

Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls = 31 + 8 + 9
= 48

Now, we know that after buying the bouncy balls, Sophie had a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls she bought, we need to subtract the total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls.

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys after buying bouncy balls - Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls
= 62 - 48
= 14

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Peter, Paul, and Jean's ages add up to 100 years. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

Let's use variables to represent their ages: P for Peter, Pp for Paul, and J for Jean.

We can write an equation based on the first piece of information: P + Pp + J = 100.

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so we can write another equation: Pp = J + 10.

We can substitute the second equation into the first one: P + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Combine like terms: P + 2J + 10 = 100.

Now, let's get rid of the 10 by subtracting 10 from both sides: P + 2J = 90.

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages, so we can write another equation: P = Pp + J.

We can substitute Pp with J + 10: P = (J + 10) + J.

Combine like terms: P = 2J + 10.

Now we have two equations with P and J: P + 2J = 90 and P = 2J + 10.

We can substitute the second equation into the first one: (2J + 10) + 2J = 90.

Combine like terms: 4J + 10 = 90.

Subtract 10 from both sides: 4J = 80.

Divide both sides by 4: J = 20.

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age: Pp = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Finally, we can find Peter's age: P = Pp + J = 30 + 20 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's figure out how many water balloons the girls have.

Maria starts with 1 water balloon. Her 4 friends each have 2 water balloons, so we multiply 4 by 2 to find out how many balloons they have in total. That's 4 x 2 = 8 balloons.

Now, we add Maria's balloon to her friends' balloons: 1 + 8 = 9 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gives each of them 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people, we multiply 5 by 3 to find out how many more balloons they get: 5 x 3 = 15 balloons.

Now, we add the new balloons to the balloons they already had: 9 + 15 = 24 balloons.

The final answer is: 24"
"So, let's figure out how many tables they need for the yard sale. 

First, we need to know how many boxes of stuff they have in total. They got 10 people donating 5 boxes each, so that's 10 x 5 = 50 boxes. And they already had 10 boxes, so they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes in total.

Now, we need to know how many boxes can fit on each table. They said they can fit 2 boxes per table. 

To find out how many tables they need, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes that can fit on each table. That's 60 ÷ 2 = 30 tables.

But, they already have 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide by the number of seeds.

Zoey's watermelon has 40 seeds, and she spits each one 10 feet. So, her total distance is 40 x 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney's watermelon has 35 seeds, and she spits each one 12 feet. So, her total distance is 35 x 12 = 420 feet.

Now, we add their total distances together: 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

To find the average, we need to know how many seeds they spat in total. Zoey spat 40 seeds and Sydney spat 35 seeds, so together they spat 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

Now, we divide the total distance by the total number of seeds: 820 ÷ 75 = 10.93 feet.

The final answer is: 10.93"
"Let's figure out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000.

First, we need to find out how many widgets each machine can make in a month. We know that the Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. There are 24 hours in a day and 30 days in a month.

So, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can make in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Now, we need to find out how much money each machine will make. Each widget sells for $6.

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we need to subtract the money made by the WidgetMaster 9000 from the money made by the Widgeteer 3000:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"Let's break down Cameron's hotel stay. He arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. That's a total of 17 hours.

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay, and then 70 pesos for every hour after that. So, for the first 12 hours, Cameron pays 1000 pesos. Then, he has to pay 70 pesos for each of the 5 extra hours.

To find out how much he pays for the extra hours, we multiply 70 pesos by 5 hours: 70 × 5 = 350 pesos.

Now, we add the cost of the first 12 hours (1000 pesos) to the cost of the extra hours (350 pesos): 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The hotel also charges 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. To find out how much Cameron saves, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour stay plus extra hours from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: 250"
"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we need to know how much each goat and each sheep needs. 

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. To find out how much each sheep needs, we need to know that it's 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we multiply 5 by 2 to get 10, and then subtract 3 to get 7. 

Now, we need to multiply the amount each goat needs by the number of goats, and the amount each sheep needs by the number of sheep. There are 15 goats and 12 sheep. 

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

To find the total amount of hay Nate needs, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

John earns 50 dollars an hour and works 6 hours in a week. To find out how much he earns, we multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he works.

50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

Now, let's subtract the cost of gas and the money he wants to deposit in the bank from his earnings.

Gas cost: 50 dollars
Deposit: 100 dollars
Remaining money: 300 - 50 - 100 = 150 dollars

Next, John buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each. We need to subtract the cost of the pencils from his remaining money.

Cost of pencils: 5 * 10 = 50 dollars
Remaining money after buying pencils: 150 - 50 = 100 dollars

Now, let's find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money.

"Let's figure out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left.

First, we need to find out how many bottles the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. To find the total number of bottles given to the students, we multiply the number of students by the number of bottles each student gets:

29 students × 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

Now, we need to find out how many bottles the teacher gets. She has 9 coupons, and each coupon is good for 100 bottles of apple juice. To find the total number of bottles she gets, we multiply the number of coupons by the number of bottles each coupon is good for:

9 coupons × 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Now, we need to find out how many bottles the teacher has left. To do this, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher got:

900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

James bought 10 CDs for $15 each. First, we need to find out how much he paid for all the CDs. 

10 CDs * $15 = $150

Then, he got a 40% discount on the total price. To find 40% of $150, we multiply $150 by 0.4.

0.4 * $150 = $60

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the price after the discount.

$150 - $60 = $90

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. To find out how much he made from selling the CDs, we multiply the number of CDs by the price he sold them for.

5 CDs * $40 = $200

Now, we need to find out how much money James was out. To do this, we subtract the price he paid for the CDs from the money he made from selling them.

$200 - $90 = $110

"To find out how much Jen will earn from selling her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of crop and then add them together.

First, let's find out how much she will earn from the yams. We multiply the number of yams by the price of each yam: 6 yams * $1.5 = $9.

Next, we calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes. We multiply the number of sweet potatoes by the price of each sweet potato: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 = $20.

Now, let's find out how much she will earn from the carrots. We multiply the number of carrots by the price of each carrot: 4 carrots * $1.25 = $5.

Now, we add the earnings from each type of root crop together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find out how long it took James to swim across the lake, we need to break it down into smaller parts.

First, we need to find out how long it took James to swim 60% of the lake. 60% of 20 miles is 0.6 x 20 = 12 miles.

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, we can find the time it took him to swim 12 miles by dividing the distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. Since he swam for 6 hours, he rests for 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

To find the total time, we add the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"Let's figure out how many loaves of bread the bakery has. We know that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had.

To find the number of loaves the bakery has, we need to multiply 70 by 7 first. That's 7 × 70 = 490.

Now, we need to subtract 40 from 490. So, 490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final answer is: 450"
"Let's figure out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end.

Jasmine got 15 stickers for participating in class. Then, she lost 7 stickers during playtime. To find out how many stickers she has left, we need to subtract 7 from 15. 

15 - 7 = 8

After that, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. To find out how many stickers she has now, we need to add 5 to 8.

8 + 5 = 13

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

13"
"Let's figure out how much commission Cayley will get from selling newspapers.

First, we need to find out how much commission he gets from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately.

For the New York Times:
- He sells 6 copies at $5 each.
- He gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100
- Commission = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
- Commission = 300 / 100
- Commission = $3

For the Wall Street Journal:
- He sells 10 copies at $15 each.
- He gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100
- Commission = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
- Commission = 1200 / 100
- Commission = $12

Now, let's add the commissions together to find the total commission:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = $3 + $12
- Total commission = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's figure out how old Leo is.

We know that Deanna is 26 years old. We also know that Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna. To find Marcus's age, we need to subtract 5 from Deanna's age.

Deanna's age: 26
Marcus's age: 26 - 5 = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. To find Leo's age, we need to multiply Marcus's age by 2.

Marcus's age: 21
Leo's age: 21 x 2 = 42

So, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored.

Let's say Azibo scored A points, Bahati scored B points, and Dinar scored D points.

We know that B = A + 20 (because Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo) and B = D + 10 (because Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar).

We can write an equation using the fact that the total points scored by the three is 45: B + A + D = 45.

We can substitute B = A + 20 into the equation B + A + D = 45 to get (A + 20) + A + D = 45.

This simplifies to 2A + D + 20 = 45.

We can also substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45 to get (D + 10) + A + D = 45.

This simplifies to 2D + A + 10 = 45.

Now we have two equations: 2A + D + 20 = 45 and 2D + A + 10 = 45.

We can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate A: (2A + D + 20) - (2D + A + 10) = 45 - 45.

This simplifies to A - D + 10 = 0.

We can rearrange the equation to get A - D = -10.

Now we can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10.

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation B = A + 20 to get B = (D - 10) + 20.

This simplifies to B = D + 10.

We know that B = D + 10 and B = A + 20.

We can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B = A + 20 to get D + 10 = A + 20.

We can subtract 10 from both sides to get D = A + 10.

Now we have A = D - 10 and D = A + 10.

We can substitute D = A + 10 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = (A + 10) - 10.

This simplifies to A = A.

We can substitute D = A + 10 into the equation 2A + D + 20 = 45 to get 2(A + 10) + A + 20 = 45.

This simplifies to 3A + 30 = 45.

We can subtract 30 from both sides to get 3A = 15.

We can divide both sides by 3 to get A = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to know how many pages are in each inch and how thick the book is. 

Since each inch has 100 pages and each page is printed on both sides, that means there are 100 * 2 = 200 pages in each inch.

The book is 1.5 inches thick, so we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book: 200 * 1.5 = 300 pages.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to know how many minutes he worked and how many reports he staples per minute. 

Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. So, we need to find out how many 15-minute periods are in a day. There are 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day. 

60 minutes/hour * 24 hours = 1440 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute periods are in 1440 minutes:
1440 minutes / 15 minutes = 96

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply the number of reports per 15 minutes by the number of 15-minute periods:
30 reports/15 minutes * 96 15-minute periods = 2880 reports

The final answer is: 2880"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to know how long she usually sleeps and how long she was awake during the night.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. That's 8 hours. We can convert hours to minutes by multiplying by 60. So, 8 hours is 8 x 60 = 480 minutes.

But she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. That means she slept for 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. We can find the time she was sleepwalking by subtracting the start time from the end time. 2:38 - 2:15 = 23 minutes.

So, we subtract 23 minutes from her total sleep time: 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

The final answer is: 452"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jonathan has 2 dozen measuring cups. We know that 1 dozen is 12, so 2 dozen is 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. We know he has 2/3 as many spoons as cups. To find 2/3 of 24, we multiply 24 by 2 and then divide by 3.

(24 x 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.

After giving 6 spoons to Pedro, Jonathan has 16 - 6 = 10 spoons left.

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has, we add the number of cups and spoons.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

The final answer is: 34"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many beds are already occupied in the hospital. The hospital has 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. To find 1/5 of 1000, we can multiply 1000 by 1/5.

1000 × (1/5) = 100

This means 100 beds are occupied. Since 1/5 of the beds are occupied, 4/5 of the beds are unoccupied. To find 4/5 of 1000, we can multiply 1000 by 4/5.

1000 × (4/5) = 800

So, 800 beds are unoccupied.

Now, let's find out how many patients will be admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 14 days in 2 weeks. If 50 patients are admitted each day, we can multiply 50 by 14.

50 × 14 = 700

This means 700 more patients will be admitted in 2 weeks. Now, we add the number of occupied beds initially to the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks.

100 + 700 = 800

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds.

1000 - 800 = 200

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's figure out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend.

Robyn sends 16 emails a day. Out of those, 7 are work emails. So, we need to find out how many emails are not work-related. We do that by subtracting the work emails from the total emails: 16 - 7 = 9.

Now, we know that 2/3 of the non-work emails are to her family. To find 2/3 of 9, we multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3: (2/3) × 9 = (2 × 9) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6. So, 6 emails are to her family.

That means the remaining non-work emails (not to family) are 9 - 6 = 3.

Now, we need to find out how many of those 3 emails are to her boyfriend. We know that 1/3 of those emails are to her boyfriend. To find 1/3 of 3, we multiply 3 by 1 and then divide by 3: (1/3) × 3 = (1 × 3) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's figure out how old Shawna's dad is.

We know that Aliya is 3 years old. We also know that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. So, if Aliya is 3, Shawna must be 3 x 3 = 9 years old.

Now, we know that Shawna's dad is five times as old as Shawna. So, if Shawna is 9 years old, her dad must be 5 x 9 = 45 years old.

The final answer is: 45"
"So, let's figure out how many people really went to the concert. Courtney said there were 48 people, but Kelly said Courtney made a mistake and that the number was 20% too high. 

To find the real number, we need to subtract 20% of 48 from 48. 

20% of 48 is 0.20 x 48 = 9.6. 

Now, we subtract 9.6 from 48 to get the real number of people who went to the concert.
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"Let's figure out how many basketballs the coach brought to practice. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and he carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. So, if Jason carried 2 balls, then Jeffrey must have carried half of that, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan must have carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Now, let's add up the number of balls each of them carried: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

So, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's figure out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day. 

First, we need to know how many holes they dug in total by the end of the third day. They dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day. But they filled in 2 holes, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes at the end of the third day.

Now, we know that by the end of the fourth day, there were 4 times as many holes as there were at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, we multiply 10 by 4 to get the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

10 × 4 = 40 holes at the end of the fourth day.

Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, we subtract 29 from 40 to find out how many holes they dug on the fourth day.

40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got the same amount of corn chips, which is 70. Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others. So, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

To find the total number of corn chips, we need to add the number of corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got. We can do this by adding 70 + 70 + 85.

70 + 70 = 140
140 + 85 = 225

So, the total number of corn chips is 225.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, we find 50% of the cost of supplies: 50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Then, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel: $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have caught a total of 339 Pokémon. We also know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught.

Let's use variables to represent the number of Pokémon each person has caught. Let A be the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught, S be the number of Pokémon Stan has caught, and L be the number of Pokémon Alex has caught.

We can write an equation to represent the total number of Pokémon caught: A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, so we can write another equation: L = S + 5.

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write another equation: S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.
A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Now we can substitute the third equation into the previous one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.
A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.
9A - 21 = 339.

Now we can add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Now we can divide both sides by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 147"
"So, John is watching a new show. Each episode is 20 minutes long. The problem says there are half as many episodes as there are minutes in an episode. That means if there are 20 minutes in an episode, there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode. So, we multiply 10 episodes by 20 minutes per episode: 10 x 20 = 200 minutes.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to figure out how far the bird traveled in total in the direction of her southern home and then subtract the distance she traveled in the opposite direction.

First, let's find out how far the bird traveled in the first 10 hours. We know she flew at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 10 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles.

Next, the bird flew for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

Then, the bird flew for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.

Since the bird flew 36 miles north, we need to subtract this from the total distance she traveled in the southerly direction to find the net distance between the two homes.

Net distance = Distance traveled in the first 10 hours + Distance traveled in the last 5 hours - Distance traveled in the 2 hours
Net distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Net distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"So, Greta wanted brownies for her birthday. She made a batch for herself, which is 1 dozen, and that's 12 brownies. Then, her office gave her 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies. And her friends gave her 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

To find the total number of brownies she got, we add them all together: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66.

Now, some brownies got eaten. They ate 1 1/2 dozen, which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

To find out how many brownies Greta has left, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she got: 66 - 18 = 48.

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 x 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 x 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"So, Andy works at a tennis resort and he has to string 12 racquets. Some of them need synthetic gut, some need polyester string, and some need a mix of both. We need to figure out how long it will take him to string all of them.

First, let's break it down. There are 3 racquets that need synthetic gut, and it takes Andy 15 minutes to string each one. So, that's 3 x 15 = 45 minutes.

Next, there are 5 racquets that need polyester string, and it takes Andy 22 minutes to string each one. So, that's 5 x 22 = 110 minutes.

Lastly, there are 4 racquets that need a mix of both synthetic gut and polyester string, and it takes Andy 18 minutes to string each one. So, that's 4 x 18 = 72 minutes.

Now, we need to add all these times together to find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets. So, 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

"So, John wants to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife. The first 2 phones cost $600 each, and the rest are half price. 

First, we need to find the cost of the first 2 phones. That's easy: 2 x $600 = $1200.

Now, we need to find the cost of the other 2 phones. Since they're half price, we divide $600 by 2 to get the cost of one phone, which is $300. Then, we multiply $300 by 2 to get the total cost of the other 2 phones, which is $600.

Now, we add the cost of the first 2 phones ($1200) to the cost of the other 2 phones ($600) to get the total cost. $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"

The garden is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. So, we add 15 + 10 + 15 + 10 to find the perimeter.

Perimeter = 15 + 10 + 15 + 10
Perimeter = 50

Now, we know Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing. So, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. Each box has 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she bought is 12 x 20 = 240 oranges.

She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box has 20 oranges, she gave away 4 x 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, she has 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left. To find out how many oranges are in these boxes, we multiply 8 by 20, which is 8 x 20 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find 1/4 of 160, we multiply 160 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 160 by 4. So, 160 ÷ 4 = 40 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we need to know how much money he still needs to earn. First, we need to add up the cost of all the books. 

The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 

$18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Since Tyler already has $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract that from the total cost of the books to find out how much more he needs to earn.

$39 - $14 = $25

Now, we know that Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we can divide the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler needs to work for 5 hours to afford his books."
"Let's figure out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry.

We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more cherries than Richard. To find out how many cherries Richard has, we need to subtract 10 from 30. 

30 - 10 = 20

So, Richard has 20 cherries. Now, we know that Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries together. Since there are 60 cherries in total, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. To do this, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has.

30 (Robert's cherries) - 10 (Jerry's cherries) = 20

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"Let's figure out how much Sunny made from selling gingerbread and apple pie.

We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. We also know that he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. So, if we let A be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday, then the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday is A - 4.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which means he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.

We also know that on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. Since he sold A boxes of apple pie on Sunday, we can say that A = 15.

Now, we can find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday by substituting A = 15 into A - 4. So, A - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

- Total earnings on Saturday = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225.
- Total earnings on Sunday = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315.

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday = 225 + 315 = 540.

"To figure out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs, we need to know how much sunscreen she uses in total. She reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day. So, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day.

Since she will be on vacation for 8 days, we need to multiply the number of times she reapplies sunscreen per day (4) by the number of days (8). This is called multiplication.

4 * 8 = 32

This means she will reapply sunscreen 32 times. Since she uses 1 ounce of sunscreen each time, she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Now, we need to know how many ounces are in each bottle of sunscreen. It's 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 ÷ 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to figure out what 40% of the blue car's price is, and then subtract that from the price of the blue car.

The price of the blue car is $100. To find 40% of $100, we multiply $100 by 0.4 (since 40% is the same as 40/100 or 0.4).

0.4 x $100 = $40

Now, we subtract $40 from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car.

Price of red car = Price of blue car - $40
= $100 - $40
= $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The total cost of both cars is the sum of their prices:

Total cost = Price of blue car + Price of red car
= $100 + $60
= $160

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's figure out the problem together.

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother. 

First, let's think about Emil's brother. If Emil is twice as old as his brother when he turns 24, then his brother must be half of 24, which is 12 years old. But since Emil is 5 years away from turning 24, his brother is 12 - 5 = 7 years old now.

Now, let's think about Emil's dad. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad will be twice as old as Emil, which is 24 * 2 = 48 years old. Since Emil is 5 years away from turning 24, his dad is 48 - 5 = 43 years old now.

So, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's figure out how many beads Adrianne has. 

Her mom gave her 20 beads. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mom, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads. 

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mom, so her friend gave her 2 x 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (mom) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"So, let's figure out how many servings of crawfish Joe has. 

Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday. Then, he caught 4 times that amount on Friday, which is 3 x 4 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 ÷ 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's figure out how many students are leaving early. 

First, we need to find out how many students are football players. To do that, we need to find 20% of 30 students. 

20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6 students.

Now, we need to find out how many students are not football players. That's 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Next, we need to find out how many of those 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. To do that, we need to find 25% of 24 students. 

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find out how many students are leaving early. 

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to add their shoe sizes and divide by 2.

Sophie's shoe size is 5. 
Charlie's shoe size is 5 times Sophie's, so it is 5 * 5 = 25.

The sum of their shoe sizes is 5 + 25 = 30.
The average shoe size is 30 / 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how much money Pat will spend at the store, we need to figure out how many plants she can fit in her flower bed. The flower bed is 111 feet long, and each plant is 12 inches wide. Pat also needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant.

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Now, let's subtract the width of the plant (12 inches) and the space between the plants (18 inches) from the total length of the flower bed. We'll call the number of plants 'n'. The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is 1332 - 18n - 12n = 1320 - 30n.

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 'n - 17' more flowers. The total cost of the flowers will be the number of flowers she needs to buy multiplied by the cost of each flower, which is (n - 17) * 6.

We know that the total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is equal to the width of the plant (12 inches) multiplied by the number of plants (n). So, we can set up the equation: 12n = 1320 - 30n.

To solve for 'n', we can add 30n to both sides of the equation: 42n = 1320. Then, we can divide both sides by 42: n = 1320 / 42 = 31.4286. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 31 plants.

Now that we know Pat needs 31 - 17 = 14 more flowers, we can calculate the total cost: 14 * 6 = 84.

The final answer is: $84"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate half of 18. 

18 ÷ 2 = 9

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 × 7 = 63

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"To find out how much Katherine will spend on the hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the petunias. We know Katherine has 5 baskets and she wants to put 3 petunias in each basket. So, we multiply 5 (the number of baskets) by 3 (the number of petunias per basket) to get the total number of petunias: 5 x 3 = 15. Now, we multiply the total number of petunias by the cost of each petunia, which is $3.00. So, 15 x $3.00 = $45.00.

Next, let's find the cost of the sweet potato vines. We know Katherine has 5 baskets and she wants to put 2 sweet potato vines in each basket. So, we multiply 5 (the number of baskets) by 2 (the number of vines per basket) to get the total number of vines: 5 x 2 = 10. Now, we multiply the total number of vines by the cost of each vine, which is $2.50. So, 10 x $2.50 = $25.00.

Now, we add the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines together to get the total cost: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"Let's figure out how many roses Artemis and her dad can plant. They have a 30-pound bag of soil. 

First, we need to find out how much soil they used for the sunflowers and carnations. Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they planted 4 sunflowers. So, 4 x 3 = 12 pounds of soil for the sunflowers.

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they planted 10 carnations. So, 10 x 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil for the carnations.

Now, let's add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations: 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

They have 30 pounds of soil in total, so they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds left for the roses.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to know how much money she saves each month and how much one pair of shoes costs.

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month. She sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply 0.25 by $2,000.00.

0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

This means Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply $500.00 by 12 to find out how much she saves in a year.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to know how much one pair of shoes costs. Each pair costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs she can buy, we divide the total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes.

$6,000.00 ÷ $1,000.00 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"Let's figure out how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

First, we need to find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time. 

90 ÷ 6 = 15 minutes

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to get the time. 

90 ÷ 30 = 3, so it takes her 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

Since peeling and cooking are done at the same time, we need to find the longer time between the two tasks. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The longer time is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's figure out how many degrees lower the final temperature is than the starting temperature.

The air conditioner cools the room at different rates. On low, it cools the room 2 degrees an hour, and on high, it cools the room 3 degrees an hour. The room also warms up at 2 degrees an hour when the air conditioner is not running.

First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours. This means it cooled the room by 3 x 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours. This means it cooled the room by 4 x 3 = 12 degrees.

So, the total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

But, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up by 2 x 2 = 4 degrees.

To find the net cooling effect, we subtract the warming effect from the total cooling effect: 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Let's figure out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.

We know that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his dad was when he saw the comet. 

To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the second time, we need to multiply the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet by 3. 

3 * 30 = 90 years old.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time. 

So, Bill's dad was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when Bill was born.

Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, Bill was 30 - 15 = 15 years old when his dad was born.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final answer is: 15"
"So, let's figure out how many checks Buford writes per year. He writes a check for his electric bill every month, which is 12 times a year. He also writes a check for his gas bill every month, which is 12 times a year. Then, he writes two checks to the church every month, so that's 24 checks per year. Lastly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service every 3 months, which is 4 times a year.

To find the total number of checks, we need to add all these numbers together: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split between France and Germany. We also know that the second plane flies to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.

Let's say the first plane makes x flights. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, we can say that x = 2 * 44 = 88.

Now, let's find out how many flights the first plane makes to Greece. Since it goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, we can multiply 88 by 3/4 to get the number of flights to Greece: (3/4) * 88 = 66.

The remaining flights are split between France and Germany, so we need to find out how many flights are left after the plane goes to Greece. We can do this by subtracting the number of flights to Greece from the total number of flights: 88 - 66 = 22.

Since the remaining flights are split between France and Germany, we can divide 22 by 2 to find the number of flights to France: 22 / 2 = 11.

So, the first plane makes 11 flights to France.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's figure out how long the three wolves howl at the moon. We know that Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to add up the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 ÷ 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's figure out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings.

Adam bought some new trousers for $30. His mom gave him $6 to help him buy the trousers. His dad gave him twice as much as his mom, so his dad gave him 2 x $6 = $12.

To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to add up the money he got from his mom and dad. $6 + $12 = $18.

Now, we need to subtract the total amount of money Adam got from his parents from the cost of the trousers. $30 (cost of trousers) - $18 (money from parents) = $12.

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the total age of the children is 20. We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. We need to find the age of Wilfred.

Let's start by adding the ages of Akbar and Alessandro:
3 + 4 = 7

Now, we know that the total age of the children is 20, so we can set up an equation:
7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20

We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. To find the average age, we need to divide the total age by the number of children. There are 4 children, so the average age is:
(7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can set up another equation:
Helene's age = 2 * ((7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4)

Now, we can simplify the equation by substituting Helene's age in terms of the average age:
Helene's age = 2 * ((7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4)
Helene's age = (2 * (7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age)) / 4
4 * Helene's age = 2 * (7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age)
4 * Helene's age = 14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W
2 * Helene's age = 14 + 2W
Helene's age = 7 + W

Now we can substitute Helene's age in the first equation:
7 + (7 + W) + W = 20
14 + 2W = 20
2W = 6
W = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"Walter is collecting money for charity. He gets $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from a fund he set up online. Then, his friend gives him $200. But, his lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates, not including his friend.

First, we need to add up the money Walter got from his neighbors and the online fund. That's $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Now, we need to multiply this amount by 3 to find out how much the lawyer will donate. 3 x $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"Let's figure out how many people were in the church next door. 

First, we need to find out how many cookies were given to the church. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, we multiply 100 by 15 to get the total number of cookies. 

100 x 15 = 1500

The bride gave half of the cookies to the church. To find half of 1500, we divide 1500 by 2.

1500 ÷ 2 = 750

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

Number of people in the church = 750 ÷ 15
= 50

"Let's say the total watermelon is 100 units. We want to divide it among 2 adults and 4 kids. Each adult gets twice as much as each kid.

Let's say each kid gets x units of watermelon. Since each adult gets twice as much as each kid, each adult gets 2x units.

The total amount of watermelon given to the kids is 4x (4 kids * x units each). The total amount given to the adults is 2x (2 adults * 2x units each).

Since the total watermelon is 100 units, we can set up the equation: 4x + 2x = 100.

Combine like terms: 6x = 100.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 100 / 6 = 16.67.

Now that we know each kid gets 16.67 units, each adult gets 2x = 2 * 16.67 = 33.33 units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (33.33 / 100) * 100 = 33.33%.

The final answer is: 33.33"
"So, Doctor Jones is working at the clinic on Monday. He has to do some stuff. He works for 9 hours. He has to check on 9 patients, and each check takes 20 minutes. He also has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes.

First, let's find out how much time he spends checking on patients. We multiply the number of patients by the time it takes to check on each one: 9 patients * 20 minutes = 180 minutes. 

Next, we find out how much time he spends on appointments. We multiply the number of appointments by the time each appointment takes: 10 appointments * 30 minutes = 300 minutes.

Now, we add the time he spends on patients and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

To make it easier to understand, let's convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 480 minutes by 60: 480 ÷ 60 = 8 hours.

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours, we subtract the time he spends on patients and appointments from his total work hours: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"To figure out the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time it takes to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time it takes to make the cake batter and bake the cake. That's 20 minutes for the batter and 30 minutes for baking, which is 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Next, we need to add the time it takes for the cake to cool. The instructions say it takes 2 hours, and since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can multiply 2 hours by 60 to get 120 minutes. 

Now, we add the time it takes to frost the cake, which is 10 minutes.

So, the total time is 50 minutes (batter and baking) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 10 minutes (frosting) = 180 minutes.

To make it easier to understand, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 180 ÷ 60 = 3 hours.

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm to find the latest time she can start making the cake. 

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Lisa and Peter sold a total of 64 chocolate bars together. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to figure out how many chocolate bars they sold in total and then divide that by the number of boxes they sold.

Let's say there are x chocolate bars in a box. Then, Lisa sold 3.5x chocolate bars and Peter sold 4.5x chocolate bars. Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars.

We know they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 8x = 64

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 8. This will give us the number of chocolate bars in a box.

8x = 64
x = 64 ÷ 8
x = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to know how much they make from renting the studio and from the students.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, the studio is rented 3 * 4 = 12 times in a month.

The cost to rent the studio is $25 per session. The cost for the students is $1.50 per student, and there are 10 students. So, the total cost for the students is $1.50 * 10 = $15 per session.

To find the total cost per session, we add the cost to rent the studio and the cost for the students: $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

Now, we multiply the total cost per session by the number of sessions in a month: $40 * 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for Peter and Martha. We can do this by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars ÷ 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars ÷ 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's figure out how many porcupines will be in the park after a year.

First, we need to find out how many female porcupines there are. Since 3/5 of the total population are female, we multiply 50 by 3/5.

50 × (3/5) = 30

So, there are 30 female porcupines. Now, we need to find out how many babies they will have in a year. Each female porcupine has 4 babies every month, and there are 12 months in a year. 

4 × 12 = 48

This means that the female porcupines will have 48 babies in a year. To find the total number of porcupines after a year, we add the initial population to the number of babies born.

50 + 48 = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we do this next:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

"Let's count the sticks. We know there are 9 red sticks. We also know there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, to find the number of blue sticks, we add 5 to 9. That's 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.

Now, we know there are 3 fewer yellow sticks than blue sticks. To find the number of yellow sticks, we subtract 3 from 14. That's 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

To find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

"To find out how many miles each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the time they traveled.

Matteo's speed is 55 miles per hour, and he traveled for 4 hours. So, we multiply 55 miles/hour by 4 hours to get his total distance.

55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's speed is 45 miles per hour, and he traveled for 10 hours. So, we multiply 45 miles/hour by 10 hours to get his total distance.

45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between their distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo.

Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance
= 450 miles - 220 miles
= 230 miles

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are 3000 students in total. Half of them are over 16 years old, and the other half are under 16 years old.

1. Total students = 3000
2. Students over 16 = 3000 / 2 = 1500
3. Students under 16 = 3000 / 2 = 1500

Now, let's find out how many of the students over 16 are male. We know that one-fourth of the students over 16 are male.

4. Male students over 16 = 1500 / 4 = 375

To find the number of female students over 16, we subtract the number of male students from the total number of students over 16.

5. Female students over 16 = 1500 - 375 = 1125

Now, let's find out how many of the students under 16 are male. We know that one-half of the students under 16 are male.

6. Male students under 16 = 1500 / 2 = 750

To find the number of female students under 16, we subtract the number of male students from the total number of students under 16.

7. Female students under 16 = 1500 - 750 = 750

Finally, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to find the total number of female students.

8. Total female students = 1125 + 750 = 1875

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"Let's figure out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn.

First, we know that Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. 

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. To do this, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run. 

10 (Bethany's laps) - 5 (Quinn's laps) = 5

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped into the tank on the first day. Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Since Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

Now, let's add up the total amount of water pumped into the tank: 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons, we need to subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity to find out how much water is remaining: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Maria's power bank was losing 9% of its capacity each hour for 5 hours. After 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - 45% = 55%.

Then, it started losing 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours. After 3 hours, the charge remaining is 55% - 21% = 34%.

But we know that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the 34% remaining after 8 hours is reduced to 28% after the last 3 hours. To find the charge remaining after 8 hours, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the last 3 hours.

Let's call the charge remaining after 8 hours ""x"". Then, the charge lost in the last 3 hours is x - 28%. We know that the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 34% - 28% = 6%.

So, we can set up the equation: x - 28% = 6%.

Solving for x, we get x = 34%.

Now, we know that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34%. We also know that the charge remaining after 5 hours is 55%. To find the initial charge, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the first 5 hours.

The charge lost in the first 5 hours is 55% - 34% = 21%.

So, we can set up the equation: x - 21% = 55%.

Solving for x, we get x = 76%.

The final answer is: 76"
"So, Janet gets a job as a waitress. She makes $10 an hour from her wages and $15 an hour from tips. That's a total of $25 an hour. If she works 40 hours a week, she makes $25 * 40 = $1000 per week.

Janet wants to save up 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car for a down payment. To find 20% of $10,000, we multiply $10,000 by 0.2. That's $10,000 * 0.2 = $2,000.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2,000. We can do this by dividing $2,000 by her weekly earnings of $1,000. $2,000 ÷ $1,000 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's figure out how many plums Jamaar can buy. First, we need to find out how much money he has left after buying the other fruits. 

He bought 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples. Let's calculate the total cost of these fruits:

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 × $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 × $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 × $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 × $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the total cost of these fruits: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 ÷ $0.25 = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Anne has a box of sweets with 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. She kept 2 packs for herself and gave the rest to her 10 friends.

First, we need to find out how many packs she gave to her friends. To do this, we subtract the packs she kept from the total number of packs:

15 (total packs) - 2 (packs kept) = 13 packs

Now, we need to divide the packs she gave away by the number of friends:

13 packs ÷ 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we need to find out how many pieces are in 0.3 packs (because 1 pack is 60 pieces). To do this, we multiply 0.3 by 60:

0.3 packs × 60 pieces/pack = 18 pieces

Now, we add the pieces in 1 pack (60) to the pieces in 0.3 packs (18):

60 pieces + 18 pieces = 78 pieces

So, each friend received 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to add 5% of the original price to the original price each year.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook. She put the same number of pictures into 8 albums. We need to find out how many portraits and selfies she had.

First, we need to find out how many pictures are in each album. To do this, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

72 pictures ÷ 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies only. So, the number of selfies is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 albums - 3 selfies albums = 5 albums. 
The number of portraits is 5 albums * 9 pictures per album = 45 portraits.

So, Olivia had 27 selfies and 45 portraits.

The final answer is: 45"
"Let's figure out how long James spends reading his book. We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find out how long he spends reading, we need to know how many sets of 3 pages he reads.

James reads 18 pages in total. To find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads, we divide 18 by 3. That's 18 ÷ 3 = 6 sets.

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages, we multiply the number of sets by the time per set: 6 sets * 10 minutes/set = 60 minutes.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's figure out how many guests are in the hotel now.

There were 100 guests at first. Then, 24 guests checked out early. That means we need to subtract 24 from 100. 

100 - 24 = 76

Now, 15 guests are staying late. We need to subtract those too. 

76 - 15 = 61

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who are staying late. That's 2 x 15 = 30 people.

61 + 30 = 91

After dinner, 7 more people checked in. We need to add those to the total.

91 + 7 = 98

So, the hotel now has 98 guests.

The final answer is: 98"

First, we need to know how many bananas he picked each day. On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas. On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas. Then, on Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. To find triple the number, we multiply 4 by 3, which is 3 × 4 = 12.

Now, let's add up the bananas he picked on each day: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

So, John has 22 bananas."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are in the quiz. We know there are 60 questions in total.

- 40% of the questions are easy. To find 40% of 60, we multiply 0.4 by 60. That's 0.4 × 60 = 24 easy questions.
- The rest of the questions are average and difficult. So, there are 60 - 24 = 36 average and difficult questions.
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, we divide 36 by 2. That's 36 ÷ 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's find out how many of each type of question Aries is sure to get.

- Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions. To find 75% of 24, we multiply 0.75 by 24. That's 0.75 × 24 = 18 easy questions.
- Aries is sure to get 50% of the average and difficult questions. To find 50% of 18, we multiply 0.5 by 18. That's 0.5 × 18 = 9 average questions and 0.5 × 18 = 9 difficult questions.

Now, let's add up the number of questions Aries is sure to get: 18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $120 from the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $4.

Let's say the number of small stuffed animals she sold is x. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of large stuffed animals she sold is x/2.

The price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, so the price of a large stuffed animal is $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation: 4x + 12(x/2) = 120.

To simplify the equation, we can multiply 12 by x/2, which is the same as multiplying 6 by x. So the equation becomes: 4x + 6x = 120.

Now, let's combine like terms: 10x = 120.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 10: x = 120 / 10 = 12.

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to know how many sandwiches they eat each day and multiply that by 7.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. So, we add those numbers together to get the total number of sandwiches they eat per day: 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches.

Now, we multiply 11 sandwiches by 7 days in a week: 11 x 7 = 77 sandwiches.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"Let's figure out how much money Suzanne has left.

First, we need to find out how much money she made from selling cookies and cupcakes. She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so that's 80 x $1 = $80. Then, she sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so that's 60 x $4 = $240.

Now, let's add the money she made from cookies and cupcakes: $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave a total of 2 x $10 = $20.

To find out how much money she has left, we need to subtract the money she gave to her sisters from the total money she made: $320 - $20 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's figure out how many eggs the friends found.

We know that the Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 eggs were left unfound. To find out how many eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the eggs found by the Smith twins and the unfound eggs from the total number of eggs.

Eggs found by friends = Total eggs - (Eggs found by Smith twins + Unfound eggs)
= 100 - (60 + 10)
= 100 - 70

"To find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to know how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.

First, let's figure out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. He can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

Now, let's find out how much ore he can mine with a steel pickaxe. He can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Now that we know one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, we can find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day. We multiply 36 by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 by 30 to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to figure out the price per sandwich. We know that the first package has 2 sandwiches for $3 and the second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.

First, let's find the price per sandwich for the first package. We divide the price by the number of sandwiches: $3 ÷ 2 = $1.50 per sandwich.

Now, let's find the price per sandwich for the second package. We divide the price by the number of sandwiches: $6 ÷ 4 = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for both packages. Now, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package: $1.50 × 8 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000. He sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses that to pay for part of the bedroom set. So, he still owes $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Now, we need to find out how much he has to pay per month. The interest rate is 10% per month. To find 10% of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 0.10.

$2000 × 0.10 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"Let's figure out how many balloons Sally had left.

First, we need to find out how many red balloons burst. 40% of the red balloons burst, which means 40% of 25 balloons are gone. To find 40% of 25, we multiply 25 by 0.4. 

25 * 0.4 = 10

So, 10 red balloons burst. Now, we need to find out how many red balloons are left. We subtract the number of burst balloons from the total number of red balloons.

25 - 10 = 15

Now, let's move on to the yellow balloons. Sally released half of them. To find half of 12, we divide 12 by 2.

12 ÷ 2 = 6

So, 6 yellow balloons were released. Now, we need to find out how many yellow balloons are left. We subtract the number of released balloons from the total number of yellow balloons.

12 - 6 = 6

Now, let's talk about the blue balloons. Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. To find 75% of 8, we multiply 8 by 0.75.

8 * 0.75 = 6

So, Sally added 6 blue balloons to her remaining balloons. Now, we need to find the total number of balloons Sally had left. We add the remaining red balloons, the remaining yellow balloons, the green balloons, and the added blue balloons.

15 (red) + 6 (yellow) + 7 (green) + 6 (blue) = 34

Therefore, Sally carried 34 balloons into the school."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability of having to turn in his homework.

To do this, we need to subtract 102% from 100%. However, we can't subtract a larger number from a smaller number. Instead, we can subtract 100% from 102% to get 2%. Then, we can subtract 2% from 100% to get 98%.

So, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 98%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate can get, we need to subtract the number of seats that are already taken by graduates and faculty from the total number of seats in the Fine Arts Center.

Total seats = 6000
Seats taken by graduates and faculty = 950
Seats left = Total seats - Seats taken by graduates and faculty
Seats left = 6000 - 950
Seats left = 5050

Now, we need to divide the seats left by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can get.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Seats left / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5050 ÷ 950
Tickets per graduate = 5.32

Since we can't give a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. So, each graduate can get 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's figure out how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat.

We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. We also know that he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. So, if he can eat 75 large beans, he can eat 2 x 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, we need to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. We know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. Let's use a simple equation to solve this:

Let x be the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Since 3 small beans = 1 medium-sized bean, we can write the equation as 3x = 150.

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3:

3x = 150
x = 150 ÷ 3
x = 50

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

The final answer is: 50"
"So, Melissa is on jury duty and she has to listen to a court case for 6 hours a day for 3 days. She gets paid $15 per day, but she has to pay $3 for parking each day. We need to find out how much she makes per hour after she pays for parking.

First, let's find out how much she makes in total. She gets paid $15 per day for 3 days, so that's 3 x $15 = $45. Then, she has to pay $3 for parking each day, so that's 3 x $3 = $9. To find out how much she has left after paying for parking, we subtract the parking cost from her total earnings: $45 - $9 = $36.

Now, we need to find out how many hours she worked in total. She works 6 hours a day for 3 days, so that's 6 x 3 = 18 hours.

To find out how much she makes per hour after paying for parking, we divide her total earnings after parking by the number of hours she worked: $36 ÷ 18 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"

"To find out how long it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to know how many bottles of soda he will put on his driveway and how long it takes him to go from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:

8 bottles * 5 seconds = 40 seconds

First, we need to know how many apples he has in total. He ordered two boxes of apples, and each box has 40 apples. So, we multiply 2 by 40 to find the total number of apples: 2 × 40 = 80 apples.

Now, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Each pack has 8 apples. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack: 80 ÷ 8 = 10.

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples."
"Let's figure out how much money Amor has left after buying cheese.

First, we need to find out how much the cheese costs. Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and Amor buys 2 pounds. So, the cost of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.

Next, we need to find out how much mozzarella cheese costs. Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and Amor buys 3 pounds. So, the cost of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.

Now, we need to add the cost of both cheeses together. $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so we need to subtract the cost of the cheese from that. $50 - $40 = $10.

So, Amor has $10 left to buy meat.

The final answer is: $10"
"Let's figure out how long it will take Jim to pay off his loans and the money he lost by not working while in college.

First, we need to know how much money Jim borrowed and how much he lost by not working. He borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years, so that's 4 x $50,000 = $200,000. He also lost $25,000 per year for 4 years, so that's 4 x $25,000 = $100,000. 

So, Jim needs to pay back $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

After college, Jim's income triples, so he now makes $25,000 x 3 = $75,000 per year.

To find out how long it will take Jim to pay back $300,000, we need to divide the total amount by his new income: $300,000 ÷ $75,000 = 4 years.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we need to know the size of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Since Jim wants the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to both the length and the width.

So, the new length is 6 + 2 = 8 feet, and the new width is 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Now, we need to find the area of one piece of fabric. To do this, we multiply the length by the width: 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2: 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. To find one-fifth of 425, we divide 425 by 5. 
425 ÷ 5 = 85. 
Then, we add 17 to that number: 85 + 17 = 102. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. To find twice as many as Tuesday, we multiply 102 by 2: 
102 × 2 = 204. 
Then, we add 5 to that number: 204 + 5 = 209. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"

First, let's find the cost of the chicken salad. We know that 10 people want the chicken salad and it costs $6.50 per person. So, we multiply 10 by $6.50 to get the total cost of the chicken salad.

10 x $6.50 = $65

Next, we need to find the cost of the pasta salad. We know that 6 people want the pasta salad and it costs $6 per person. So, we multiply 6 by $6 to get the total cost of the pasta salad.

6 x $6 = $36

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together to get the total amount Molly will pay for the catering.

$65 + $36 = $101

"Let's figure out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day.

First, we need to find out how much he lost in each race. 

1. In the first race, he lost $5.
2. In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, we multiply the amount he lost in the first race by 2 and then add $1. That's 2 x (-$5) + $1 = -$9.
3. In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, we multiply the amount he won in the second race by 1.5. That's 1.5 x (-$9) = -$13.50.

Now, let's add up all the money he lost: -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.50) = -$27.50.

We need to find the average loss, so we divide the total loss by the number of races. There were 3 races, so we divide -$27.50 by 3.

"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

There are 26 countries in South America. Each country has 5 cities, and each city has 1000 people. 

First, we multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country: 26 * 5 = 130
Then, we multiply the result by the population per city: 130 * 1000 = 130,000

So, the total population of South America is 130,000.

The final answer is: 130000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to first calculate their current heights.

Xavier's height: 4 feet = 4 x 12 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches) = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches
Cole's height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:
Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height
Difference = 52 inches - 51 inches
Difference = 1 inch

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's solve the problem together. We have three people who divided an amount of $1920. The second person took $80 more than the first, and the third person took twice what the second person took.

Let's say the first person took x dollars. Then the second person took x + 80 dollars, and the third person took 2(x + 80) dollars.

We know that the total amount is $1920, so we can write an equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

So, the first person took $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find out how many hours each painter worked, we need to know how many hours they worked in total and then divide that by the number of painters.

First, let's figure out how many hours they worked in a day. They worked 3/8 of a day, and there are 24 hours in a day. To find 3/8 of 24, we multiply 24 by 3 and then divide by 8.

24 × 3 = 72
72 ÷ 8 = 9

So, they worked 9 hours a day. Now, we need to find out how many days they worked. There are 7 days in a week, and they worked for 3 weeks. 

3 weeks × 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, we multiply the hours they worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day × 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours ÷ 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total. In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set. Let's call the number of balls retrieved in the second set ""x"". 

So, in the first set, he retrieved x + 4 balls. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, which is x / 2.

We can write an equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Now, let's simplify the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to know how much it depreciates each year. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year. This means that 21% of the car's price goes away each year.

Let's start with the initial price of the car, which is $20,000.

Year 2008:
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - (21% of $20,000)
= $20,000 - 0.21 * $20,000
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Year 2009:
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - (21% of $15,800)
= $15,800 - 0.21 * $15,800
= $15,800 - $3,328
= $12,472

Year 2010:
Price in 2010 = $12,472 - (21% of $12,472)
= $12,472 - 0.21 * $12,472
= $12,472 - $2,620.32
= $9,851.68

The final answer is: $9851.68"
"Let's figure out how many Spanish books there are in the library. We know there are 50 books in total. Half of them are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 English books. 

We also know that 10% of the books are written in German. To find 10% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.1 (which is the same as 10%). So, 50 * 0.1 = 5 German books.

Now, we need to find out how many books are written in Spanish. We already know there are 25 English books and 5 German books. To find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

First, we need to know the total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York. That's 1955 kilometers.

Next, we need to know how far Bernice has already driven. She drove 325 kilometers for 4 days, but the number of days doesn't matter for this problem. What matters is how far she drove, which is 325 kilometers.

Now, let's subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance:

Distance left to drive = Total distance - Distance driven
= 1955 - 325
= 1630 kilometers

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

The final answer is: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.

Now, we need to convert cups to gallons. 
There are 16 cups in a gallon. 
So, 240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Romeo starts with 120 people on the train. At the first stop, 20 more people get on, so we add 20 to 120.

120 + 20 = 140

Now, at the second stop, 50 people get off the train, and 100 people get on. To find the new total, we subtract 50 from 140 and then add 100.

140 - 50 = 90
90 + 100 = 190

At the third stop, 80 people get off the train. To find the final total, we subtract 80 from 190.

190 - 80 = 110

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To find out how much Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to add up the cost of each item.

First, let's find the cost of the tank top, which is $10. Then, we need to find the cost of the running shorts. The shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.

Next, we need to find the cost of the tennis shoes. They were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. To find half of $48, we divide $48 by 2, which is $48 ÷ 2 = $24.

Now, let's find the cost of the athletic socks. They cost $8, but Alison had a coupon for $2 off. To find the cost of the socks after the coupon, we subtract $2 from $8, which is $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55

The final answer is: $55"
"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to know how many tiles we need and how much each tile costs.

First, we need to find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Next, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt and each tile covers 1 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find out how much James pays a year for insurance, we need to first find out how much more he pays each month. We know the normal cost is $120 a month, and it's 60% more than that. 

60% of $120 is the same as 0.6 x $120. To find 60% of a number, we multiply it by 0.6. So, 0.6 x $120 = $72. 

Now, we add the extra cost to the normal cost: $120 + $72 = $192. This is how much James pays each month.

To find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12. So, $192 x 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to figure out how many loads he does in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a year.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
- 4 twin beds = 4 x 2 = 8 twin sheets
- 1 king size bed = 1 king sheet
- Total sheets = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week.
- 3 sets * 1 load/set = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: 156"
"So, let's figure out how many movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks. They watch movies every weekend, and we need to find the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks.

They watch 4 movies on Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

Now, we need to find out how many weekends are in 4 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 7 * 4 = 28 days in 4 weeks. We know that every 7 days is a week, so there are 4 weeks in 4 weeks. Therefore, there are 4 weekends in 4 weeks.

Now, we multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend (6) by the number of weekends in 4 weeks (4). 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

"Let's figure out how many slices of pizza they ate.

We know that there are 4 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 8 x 4 = 32.

Becky ate 10 slices. We also know that Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. To find out how many slices Jake ate, we need to subtract 3 from the number of slices Becky ate. Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Since Jake ate 7 slices, Silvia ate 2 x 7 = 14 slices.

Now, let's add up the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31.

"Let's solve the problem. We know that Betsy and Donovan made a meal together. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. The meal was made in 98 minutes.

Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Then Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes. We know that the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"So, Hannah slipped on a banana peel and broke her arm. Now she has to pay for the doctor's visit. Let's break down the costs.

First, she has to pay for the cast, which costs $200.

Next, she has to pay for the doctor's visit. The doctor charges $300 per hour, and the visit was 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

Then, she has to pay for the painkillers. She got 30 painkillers, and each one costs $4. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

Finally, she has to pay for parking. The doctor's office has a minimum 2-hour parking fee of $6 per hour. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

"Let's figure out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week.

First, we need to find out how many emails James doesn't respond to. 20% of his emails don't need a response. To find 20% of 80, we multiply 80 by 0.2. 

80 * 0.2 = 16

So, James doesn't respond to 16 emails. That means he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. Since James responds to 64 emails per day, in a 5-day work week, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

"Let's figure out how many pizzas are left.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.7. That's 20 x 0.7 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

Now, let's add up the pizzas eaten by both teams. 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas eaten in total.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

To find out how many pizzas are left, we subtract the total eaten from the total ordered. 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas left.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total cost of mailing small coupons. We know that Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons, and each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of small coupons by the cost per small coupon:

700 small coupons * 5 cents = 700 x 5 = 3500 cents

Next, we need to find the total cost of mailing big coupons. We know that Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he wants to send out 2 x 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of big coupons by the cost per big coupon:

1400 big coupons * 15 cents = 1400 x 15 = 21000 cents

Now, we add the total cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons to find the total cost of postage:

3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100:

24500 / 100 = 245 dollars

First, let's find out how many people are going to the party. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. But 4 people said they couldn't come. So, we need to subtract 4 from the total number of people invited.

25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) = 45
45 - 4 (people who couldn't come) = 41

Now, we need to find out how many extra people are going to the party. Since the theater can hold 20 people, we subtract 20 from the total number of people going to the party.

41 (total people going) - 20 (theater capacity) = 21

The cost for each extra person is $6. So, we multiply 21 by 6 to find the cost for the extra people.

21 × 6 = $126

The initial fee to rent the theater is $125. To find the total cost, we add the cost for the extra people to the initial fee.

$126 (extra people) + $125 (initial fee) = $251

We know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for his three monkeys. They eat these bananas for a week, which is 7 days. 

First, we need to find out how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Now, let's add the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys: 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

Since there are 3 monkeys, the total number of bananas eaten each day is 45 (315 bananas / 7 days). We already know that the first two monkeys eat 24 bananas each day. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract 24 from 45: 45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"Jenny wants to buy some roses from the florist. Roses cost $2 each or $15 for a dozen. She bought 15 roses. Since 15 is more than 12, she bought 1 dozen and 3 individual roses.

1 dozen roses cost $15. 3 individual roses cost 3 x $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny has 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 x $5 = $25. To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 x 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

"Let's figure out how long Paul will wait for his train.

First, we need to know when the first train arrives and how long it stays. The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes. It will stay in the station for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

Now, we need to find out when the second train arrives. It comes half an hour after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves at 30 minutes, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

Next, we need to find out when the third train arrives. It comes an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves at 65 minutes, the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

Now, we need to find out when the fourth train arrives. It comes 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. Since the third train leaves at 125 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Paul needs to wait from the time he arrives at the station to the time the fourth train arrives. Since the fourth train arrives at 145 minutes, Paul will wait for 145 minutes. However, we need to consider the time he waits from the first train's arrival to the fourth train's arrival.

- Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train.
- He waits from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train.
- He waits from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train.
- He waits from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

To find the total time Paul waits, we add these intervals together: 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to know how many toothpicks she has saved so far and how many more she needs.

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find the total number of toothpicks she saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saved each week by the number of weeks:
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, and she already has 120, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs:
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week:
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. He bought it at 75% of the original price, which is $2000. To find 75% of $2000, we multiply 2000 by 0.75.

2000 × 0.75 = $1500

So, Mr. Rogers paid $1500 for the watch.

Next, he sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. To find 120% of $1500, we multiply 1500 by 1.2.

1500 × 1.2 = $1800

Now, we need to find the discount that Mr. Rogers' friend got from the original price. To do this, we subtract the price he paid from the original price.

$2000 - $1800 = $200

The discount is $200. To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100.

($200 ÷ $2000) × 100 = 10%

So, Mr. Rogers' friend got a 10% discount from the original price.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many jellyfish 5 springs create in 4 hours, we need to know how many seconds are in 4 hours. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, and 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, we multiply 60 seconds/minute by 60 minutes/hour to get the total seconds in 1 hour.

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 seconds/hour

Now, we multiply the total seconds in 1 hour by 4 to get the total seconds in 4 hours:

3600 seconds/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, and there are 5 springs, we multiply the total seconds by the number of springs:

14400 seconds * 5 springs = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 × 90 = 180.

Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's score, so we add 15 to 180. 

Frankie's score is 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"Let's figure out how long it took James to get to the store. First, we need to find out how far he walked in total. Since he walked halfway to the store and then all the way back, that's like walking the whole distance twice. The store is 4 miles away from his house, so he walked 4 miles to the store and 4 miles back home. That's a total of 4 + 4 = 8 miles.

Now, we need to find out how long it took him to walk 8 miles. We know he walks 4 miles per hour. To find the time, we can use a simple formula: time = distance / speed. So, time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour.

8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours

So, it took James 2 hours to get to the store."
"Let's figure out how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches.

First, we need to know how many bananas she bought. She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, we multiply 10 bunches by 4 bananas per bunch to get the total number of bananas: 10 x 4 = 40 bananas.

Now, let's find out how much it would cost to buy 40 bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so we multiply 40 bananas by $0.80 per banana: 40 x $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, we need to find out how much it would cost to buy 10 bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00, so we multiply 10 bunches by $3.00 per bunch: 10 x $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them. They want to split it, and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. 

Let's say Sam gets 'x' feet of fence. Then Harry gets 'x + 60' feet of fence. Since they have 100 feet in total, we can write an equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to know how much it grows each year. We know that it grows 8 inches in 4 years. 

To find the growth per year, we divide the total growth by the number of years. 

Growth per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth per year = 2 inches/year

Now, we multiply the growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth per year * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

The final answer is: 26"
"Let's figure out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles.

We know that Marcel sold 300 bikes in total. Half of them were Trekking bikes, so that's 150 Trekking bikes. We also know that 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes. To find 15% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.15. That's 45 BMX bikes.

Now, let's find out how many MTB bikes Marcel sold. We know that 150 + 45 = 195 bikes were either Trekking or BMX bikes. So, the number of MTB bikes is 300 - 195 = 105.

Now, let's find out how much Marcel earned from each type of bike. A Trekking bike costs $450, so 150 Trekking bikes would be 150 x $450 = $67,500. A BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is $500. So, a BMX bike costs $250. 45 BMX bikes would be 45 x $250 = $11,250. An MTB costs $500, so 105 MTB bikes would be 105 x $500 = $52,500.

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250"
"Let's figure out how many bales of hay are left in the field. The farmer makes 5 bales of hay every hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales every hour. They both work for 6 hours.

First, we need to find out how many bales the farmer makes in 6 hours. We multiply the number of bales the farmer makes per hour (5) by the number of hours (6). That's 5 x 6 = 30 bales.

Next, we need to find out how many bales the truck picks up in 6 hours. We multiply the number of bales the truck picks up per hour (3) by the number of hours (6). That's 3 x 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we need to find out how many bales are left in the field. We subtract the number of bales the truck picks up (18) from the number of bales the farmer makes (30). That's 30 - 18 = 12 bales.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many hours John spends learning each week, we need to add up the time he spends in class and the extra time he spends learning on the weekends.

First, let's find out how many minutes John spends in class each week. He has 6 periods a day, and each period is 40 minutes long. So, we multiply 6 periods by 40 minutes to get the total minutes he spends in class each day: 6 × 40 = 240 minutes. Since he goes to class 5 days a week, we multiply 240 minutes by 5 to get the total minutes he spends in class each week: 240 × 5 = 1200 minutes.

John also has 2 extra classes each day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, we multiply 2 classes by 40 minutes to get the total minutes he spends in his extra classes each day: 2 × 40 = 80 minutes. Since he has these extra classes 5 days a week, we multiply 80 minutes by 5 to get the total minutes he spends in his extra classes each week: 80 × 5 = 400 minutes.

Now, let's add the minutes he spends in his regular classes and his extra classes: 1200 minutes + 400 minutes = 1600 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how many minutes John spends learning on the weekends. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday. To find out how many minutes he spends each day, we multiply his total weekly minutes by 1/16: 1600 × 1/16 = 100 minutes. Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, we multiply 100 minutes by 2 to get the total minutes he spends on the weekends: 100 × 2 = 200 minutes.

Now, let's add the minutes he spends in class and the minutes he spends on the weekends: 1600 minutes + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes.

Finally, we need to convert the total minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 1800 minutes by 60 to get the total hours: 1800 ÷ 60 = 30 hours.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's figure out how high the ball goes on its second bounce.

First, we need to find out how high the ball goes on its first bounce. The ball starts at 72 feet (3 stories * 24 feet/story). Since it bounces to 2/3 of its starting height, we multiply 72 by 2/3.

72 * (2/3) = 48 feet

Now, we need to find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce. We multiply the height of the first bounce (48 feet) by 2/3.

48 * (2/3) = 32 feet

So, the ball goes 32 feet high on its second bounce."
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to convert the height of the first child to inches and then calculate the height of each child step by step.

First, we know the first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply 6 by 12 to get the height in inches: 6 × 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so we add 2 to 72: 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 from 74: 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 to 69: 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to know how many bags of apples they sold. Since each bag has 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples (2000) by 10 to find the number of bags.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 × $5 = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"Let's figure out how much meat was on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate it. 

First, we know that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat. But we also know that the Allosaurus ate half of what the velociraptors had. So, the velociraptors must have had 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat.

Now, we need to find out how much meat the velociraptors had before the T-Rex ate some of it. Since the velociraptors had 540 kilograms, and that's half of what the T-Rex ate, the T-Rex must have eaten 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original weight of the triceratops must have been 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. 
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.
The total area of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"So, Ellen has a case of 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them up, which means they might spray when you open them. Then she takes 1 of the unshaken ones for herself. Now, there are 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas left.

Ellen's brother comes along and takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken ones. Now, there's 1 shaken soda and 6 unshaken ones left.

So, if Ellen's friend picks a soda, what's the chance she gets a shaken one? We need to find out how many shaken sodas there are compared to the total number of sodas.

There's 1 shaken soda and 6 unshaken ones, making a total of 7 sodas. The chance of getting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas.

Probability = (Number of shaken sodas) / (Total number of sodas)
Probability = 1 / 7

To turn this into a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

So, the chance that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is 14.29%."
"So, let's say we have two trains leaving the station at the same time, but they're going in opposite directions. One train is going 60 miles per hour, and the other train is going half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find out how far apart they are after 3 hours, we need to figure out how far each train has traveled. We can do this by multiplying the speed of each train by the number of hours they've been traveling.

The first train is going 60 miles per hour, so after 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 x 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is going 30 miles per hour, so after 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 x 3 = 90 miles.

Now, we add the distances traveled by both trains to find the total distance between them: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"Let's figure out how many people Billy can help with his taxes.

First, we need to find out how many days Billy works. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Now, Billy takes 20% of the days off. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 0.2 by 50: 0.2 × 50 = 10.

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy works: 50 - 10 = 40.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he can help per day is 2 × 3 = 6.

Now, we multiply the number of days Billy works by the number of people he can help per day to find the total number of people he helps: 40 × 6 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the number of people inside the church, we need to know how many people were in the buses and the cars. 

First, let's find out how many people were in the buses. There were 12 buses, and each bus carried 35 people. So, we multiply 12 by 35 to get the total number of people in the buses.

12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's find out how many people were in the cars. There were 20 cars, and each car carried 3 people. So, we multiply 20 by 3 to get the total number of people in the cars.

20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, we add the number of people in the buses and the cars to get the total number of people that were outside the church.

420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people outside the church from the total number of people. However, the question does not provide the total number of people present. We can assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people outside the church (i.e., 480 people) since the question does not provide any other information.

The number of people inside the church is equal to the number of people outside the church:
480 people

The final answer is: 480"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to figure out how old Martha is first. We know that Mike is 24 years old, and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. So, we subtract 4 from Mike's age to find Martha's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha is 20 years old, we need to find Jeff's age. We know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. So, we add 10 to Martha's age to find Jeff's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to figure out how long it takes to ride each slide.

The biggest slide is 300 feet long, and people slide down at 60 feet per minute. To find the time, we divide the length by the speed: 300 ÷ 60 = 5 minutes.

The second biggest slide is 240 feet long, and people slide down at 80 feet per minute. To find the time, we divide the length by the speed: 240 ÷ 80 = 3 minutes.

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many hours Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to add up the time he spends each day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 breaks of 15 minutes each. We need to add up the time for the breaks first: 2 breaks * 15 minutes = 30 minutes.

Now, we add the time for the lunch to the time for the breaks: 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 ÷ 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 hour * 5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's figure out how many miles Ahito ran. We know that Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so we need to multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

Micah's miles = 8 × 3.5
Micah's miles = 28

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"Let's figure out Sheila's new credit card balance.

First, we need to subtract the $15.00 item she returned from the initial charge of $85.00.

$85.00 (initial charge) - $15.00 (item returned) = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan. It was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20 (which is 20%).

$20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price of the frying pan.

$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels. They were on sale for 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 0.10 (which is 10%).

$30.00 x 0.10 = $3.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price of the towels.

$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the new balance.

$70.00 (previous balance) + $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's figure out how many jellyfish are in the tank.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are big, and a third of those big jellyfish change color when the UV light is on. The other jellyfish are small and stay blue all the time.

When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. This means that 6 jellyfish are big and change color.

Since a third of the big jellyfish change color, we can set up an equation to find out how many big jellyfish there are. Let's call the total number of jellyfish ""x"".

A third of the big jellyfish change color, so we can write an equation: (1/3) * (x/5) = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15 (which is the least common multiple of 3 and 5). This gives us:

x/5 = 6 * 15
x/5 = 90
x = 90 * 5
x = 450

So, there are 450 jellyfish in the tank.

The final answer is: 450"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to figure out how old Ben is first, and then multiply that by 3.

Since Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can find Ben's age by multiplying Chris's age by 2:
Ben's age = 2 × 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:
Caroline's age = 3 × 8
Caroline's age = 24

"Lauren wants to save money for retirement. She's going to save 20% of her paycheck every time she gets paid. Her current salary is $100,000 per year. She wants to live on 40% of that in retirement, which is $40,000 per year. She wants to live for 20 years in retirement, so she needs to save enough money to last that long.

To find out how much money she needs to save, we multiply her retirement income by the number of years she'll be in retirement:

$40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000

Now, we need to figure out how many years it will take her to save $800,000 if she saves $20,000 per year. We can do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings:

$800,000 ÷ $20,000 = 40 years

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save enough money for retirement.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into, and then divide that result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into.

First, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into: 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Then, we divide the result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into: 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the number of girls in the school, we need to know the total number of students. Since 40% of the students are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can use a simple math trick to find the total number of students.

We know that 40% of the students are boys, so 100% - 40% = 60% of the students are girls. We can use a simple equation to find the total number of students:

Let x be the total number of students. Then, 40% of x is equal to 240.

We can write this as an equation: 0.4x = 240

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of girls. Since 60% of the students are girls, we can multiply the total number of students by 0.6:

Number of girls = 0.6 * 600
Number of girls = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how much money my mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to add the cost of the pots and the garden soil, then subtract the coupon discount.

First, we add the cost of the pots and the garden soil: $19 + $26 = $45.

"To find the average height of the heels, we need to add up all the heights and divide by the number of women.

There are 3 women wearing 4 inch heels and 3 women wearing 2 inch heels. 

The total height of the 4 inch heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of the 2 inch heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

To find the total height of all the heels, we add 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

Now, we divide the total height by the number of women, which is 6. So, 18 ÷ 6 = 3 inches.

The average height of the heels is 3 inches."
"Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June. She plans to hike 125 miles twice a day. To find out how many miles she can hike in a day, we multiply 125 miles by 2, which is 250 miles.

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles, we divide 9,300 by 250. This is 9,300 ÷ 250 = 37.2 days.

Since Soledad only has 30 days in June, she won't be able to finish her hike on time. To find out how many more miles she can hike in 30 days, we multiply 250 miles by 30, which is 250 × 30 = 7,500 miles.

To find out how many more miles she needs to hike, we subtract 7,500 from 9,300. This is 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day, we divide 1,800 by 30. This is 1,800 ÷ 30 = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"

First, we need to find out how much Pierre and Paul will take. Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 × 1/4 = 3 kg. Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 × 1/3 = 4 kg.

To find the total amount they will take, we add 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

Now, to find out how much James will have left, we subtract the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul from the initial amount: 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to do some simple math. First, we start with the initial temperature, which is 2 degrees Celsius. Then, it drops 8 degrees Celsius overnight. So, we subtract 8 from 2.

2 - 8 = -6

Now, it increases 3 degrees Celsius in the morning. To find the final temperature, we add 3 to -6.

-6 + 3 = -3

So, the temperature in the morning is -3 degrees Celsius.

The final answer is: -3"
"Let's figure out how much money Raymond has left.

First, we need to know how much money Raymond had initially. He had $21.

Then, he saved some more money from his allowance. He saved $11, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.

Next, he spent some money on a comic book. He spent $5, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.

Finally, he spent some more money on a puzzle. He spent $19, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

So, Raymond has $8 left.

The final answer is: $8"
"Let's figure out how much each book cost. Anna had a budget of $16 and she already spent $4, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. 

After buying the 2 books, she had $2 left, which means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 ÷ 2 = $5

The final answer is: $5"
"To find the number of students in the calligraphy class this year, we need to add 20% of the students from last year to the number of students last year.

Last year, there were 50 students. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.20.

50 × 0.20 = 10

Now, we add 10 to 50 to find the number of students this year.

50 + 10 = 60

So, there are 60 students in the calligraphy class this year.

60"
"To find out how long it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to know how many times it blinks in one minute. We know that it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of blinks by the number of minutes: 
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:
459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's count the number of male and female fishes in Tate's garden pond.

First, we need to count the initial number of male and female fishes. There are 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes.

Now, Tate buys some more fishes. He buys 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes. We need to add these numbers to the initial counts.

Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fishes:
Total male fishes: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11
Total female fishes: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
Difference = Total female fishes - Total male fishes = 16 - 11 = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to add up the time each person took.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

To find the total time, we add 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours.

The final answer is: 18"
"So, John visits his parents twice a month.  It takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph.  To find out how many miles he drives in a round trip, we need to first find out how far it is to his parents' house. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since it's a round trip, we need to multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

Now, John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the total distance by 2:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

The final answer is: 560"
"Let's figure out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days. We know that Sofie will walk 10 miles every day. To find out how far she will walk in 7 days, we multiply 10 miles by 7 days. 

10 miles/day × 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks. To find half of 70 miles, we divide 70 by 2.

70 miles ÷ 2 = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 4 workers who work for 10 hours. Two of them make 6 toys per hour, and the other two make 4 toys per hour. We need to find out how many toys the fifth worker makes per hour.

First, let's find out how many toys the 4 workers make in total per hour. The two workers who make 6 toys per hour make a total of 2 x 6 = 12 toys per hour. The other two workers who make 4 toys per hour make a total of 2 x 4 = 8 toys per hour. So, the 4 workers make 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Now, let's multiply the number of toys the 4 workers make per hour by the number of hours they work, which is 10. This gives us 20 x 10 = 200 toys.

We know that the manufacturer needs a total of 420 toys to fill the order, and they already have 400 toys. This means they need 420 - 400 = 20 more toys. Since the 4 workers made 200 toys, the fifth worker must have made the remaining 20 toys.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker makes per hour, we divide the number of toys they made (20) by the number of hours they worked (10). This gives us 20 ÷ 10 = 2 toys per hour.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's figure out how much Elijah and Kory's dogs weigh altogether.

We know that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah has two dogs. One of his dogs is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, and the other is half the weight of Kory's dog.

To find the weight of Elijah's first dog, we need to divide 60 by 4. That's because one-fourth is the same as 1/4. So, 60 ÷ 4 = 15 pounds.

To find the weight of Elijah's second dog, we need to divide 60 by 2. That's because half is the same as 1/2. So, 60 ÷ 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to add up the weights of all the dogs. Elijah's first dog weighs 15 pounds, and his second dog weighs 30 pounds. So, 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add 45 (Elijah's dogs) + 60 (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"Let's figure out how many stickers Seth had in the beginning.

We know that Kris had 7 stickers, and that's half of what Luis had. To find out how many stickers Luis had, we need to multiply 7 by 2. 

7 * 2 = 14

So, Luis had 14 stickers. Now, we know that Luis had 14 stickers, and that's half of what Seth had. To find out how many stickers Seth had, we need to multiply 14 by 2.

14 * 2 = 28

So, Seth had 28 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is: 28"
"Let's figure out how many small bags John can make. He buys 3 big bags of M&M's, and each big bag weighs 10 ounces. We need to find out how many M&M's are in each big bag. 

Since each ounce has 30 M&M's, we multiply the number of ounces in each big bag by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

3 big bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make. Each small bag has 10 M&M's. To find the number of small bags, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. 

Half of the circumference of the earth is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can divide the total distance (20,000 km) by the distance he flies per day (400 km) to find out how many days it will take him to fly that distance.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to figure out how fast the 2nd fastest car goes first. We know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we multiply 120 by 5 to find its speed.

120 × 5 = 600 miles per hour

Now that we know the 2nd fastest car goes 600 miles per hour, we need to find the speed of the fastest car. We're told it's 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find this speed, we multiply 600 by 1.25.

600 × 1.25 = 750 miles per hour

So, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"So, let's figure out how old Vince is. We know Liam is 16 years old right now. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. We're told that two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, if Liam was 14, then Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago.

To find out how old Vince is now, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago. That's 7 + 2 = 9. So, Vince is 9 years old now.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs. We also know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call that number A. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted S.

Since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, we can write an equation: C = S + 12.

We also know that C + S = 30, because Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.

Now, let's substitute C = S + 12 into the equation C + S = 30. This gives us S + 12 + S = 30.

Combine like terms: 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2S = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12. This gives us C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substitute the values of A, M, C, and S: A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combine like terms: 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2A = 26.

Divide both sides by 2: A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to put them into boxes. Each box can hold 8 crayons, and each box weighs 8 ounces. We need to find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes in pounds.

First, let's find the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, we multiply the number of crayons by the weight of each crayon: 200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes Nik will need. To do this, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 crayons / 8 crayons/box = 25 boxes.

Now, we find the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the weight of each box: 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces.

To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we add the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money John makes, we need to break it down step by step.

First, John cuts down an 80-foot tree. He can make logs out of 80% of it. To find 80% of 80, we multiply 80 by 0.8.

80 * 0.8 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet, we divide 64 by 4 to find the number of logs.

64 ÷ 4 = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. So, we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2. To find out how much money he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 * 1.2 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"Let's figure out how much money Valerie, her brother, and her mom have together.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns twice as much as Valerie, so he earns 2 x $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Now, let's add Valerie and her brother's salaries together. $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

Their mom earns twice as much as Valerie and her brother combined. So, she earns 2 x $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Grandma walks 3 miles every day on her favorite walking trail. The trail is divided into two parts: 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We know that she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach.

Let's say her speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. We can use the formula: time = distance/speed. So, for the beach, time = 2 miles / x miles per minute. This is equal to 40 minutes. 

To find x, we can rearrange the formula to x = 2 miles / 40 minutes. This simplifies to x = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

To find the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, we can use the formula: time = distance/speed. So, time = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute). This simplifies to time = 10 minutes.

Now, we can find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk. We add the time spent on the beach (40 minutes) and the time spent on the sidewalk (10 minutes). The total time is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's figure out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save $60.

First, we need to know how much Jane has saved so far. She saves $4 every week and has been saving for 8 weeks. To find the total amount she has saved, we multiply the amount she saves per week by the number of weeks:

$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. We subtract the amount she has saved from the total amount she wants to save:

$60 - $32 = $28

Since Jane saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:

$28 ÷ $4/week = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree. 

First, let's count the blue birds in the 3 trees that have 7 blue birds each. We can do this by multiplying 3 (the number of trees) by 7 (the number of blue birds in each tree): 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.

Next, we need to count the blue birds in the 2 trees that have 4 blue birds each. We can do this by multiplying 2 (the number of trees) by 4 (the number of blue birds in each tree): 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the number of blue birds in each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many marbles Bob has before he gets 2 dozen more marbles. We know that 2 dozen is equal to 24, and if he gets 24 more marbles, he will have 60. So, to find out how many marbles he has before getting 24 more, we need to subtract 24 from 60.

60 - 24 = ?

To subtract 24 from 60, we can use the following steps:

60 - 20 = 40
40 - 4 = 36

So, 60 - 24 = 36. This means Bob has 36 marbles before he gets 2 dozen more marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from 36:

36 - 10 = 26

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water, one is 33 degrees, and the other is unknown. 

When he pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle, he can drink the water. This means the temperature of the water in the bottle is now at least 40 degrees.

Let's say the temperature of the other mug is x degrees. When he pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into the bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces.

The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug). 

The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2. 

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2 * 5.

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up the inequality (33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40.

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the inequality by 2.

(33 + x) * 5 >= 40 * 2
(33 + x) * 5 >= 80
Now, we need to get rid of the 5. We can do this by dividing both sides of the inequality by 5.

33 + x >= 80 / 5
33 + x >= 16
Now, we need to get rid of the 33. We can do this by subtracting 33 from both sides of the inequality.

x >= 16 - 33
x >= -17

However, the temperature can't be negative, so the minimum temperature of the second bottle must be at least 40 degrees.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's figure out how many animals Melanie's father has on his farm after three weeks.

First, we need to find out how many cows and chickens he has. He starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Every day, Milkie Cows Limited brings him 20 cows. Since there are 21 days in three weeks, we multiply 20 cows by 21 to find out how many cows he gets in three weeks.

20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

Now, we add the cows he got from Milkie Cows Limited to the cows he already had.

50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows

Next, we need to find out how many chickens he has. He starts with 20 chickens and Broilers Limited brings him 10 chickens per day. We multiply 10 chickens by 21 days to find out how many chickens he gets in three weeks.

10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, we add the chickens he got from Broilers Limited to the chickens he already had.

20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

To find the total number of animals on the farm, we add the number of cows and chickens together.

470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

The final answer is: 700"
"So, Russell orders 4 packs of bagels online. Each pack costs $10.00 and has 9 bagels in it. If he gets a 10% discount on 4 packs, how much will each single bagel cost?

First, we need to find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels. We multiply the cost of one pack by 4.

$10.00 (cost of one pack) × 4 = $40.00 (total cost of 4 packs)

Now, we need to find 10% of $40.00. To do this, we multiply $40.00 by 0.1 (which is the same as 10%).

$40.00 × 0.1 = $4.00 (10% of $40.00)

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we subtract $4.00 from the total cost of 4 packs.

$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00 (discounted cost)

Now, we need to find the total number of bagels in 4 packs. Since each pack has 9 bagels, we multiply 9 by 4.

9 × 4 = 36 (total number of bagels in 4 packs)

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels.

$36.00 ÷ 36 = $1.00 (cost of each single bagel)

The final answer is: $1.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know he ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we subtract 5 from 23:

23 - 5 = 18

Now, we need to figure out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. We know it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. Let's start by finding out how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is:

3 - 1 = 2 scoops

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 2 scoops. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops. To find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop, we divide the number of potatoes by 2:

3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop

Now, we know Gomer ate 18 scoops. To find out how many potatoes he ate, we multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:

18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's figure out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days.

Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days. To find out how many eggs he eats in 30 days, we multiply 3 eggs by 30 days.

3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

Then, Chester eats 5 eggs a day for the next 30 days. We multiply 5 eggs by 30 days.

5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the number of eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs.

90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

"So, let's figure out how many lemons Tim gets in a decade. We know he has 5 trees and each tree gives him 6 lemons every year. To find out how many lemons he gets in a year, we multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons each tree gives.

5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, we need to find out how many lemons he gets in 10 years. We can do this by multiplying the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10.

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

So, Tim gets 300 lemons in a decade.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find out how many women are left on the bus, we need to know the total number of women on the bus first. We know the ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. 

The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14. To find the number of women, we multiply the fraction of women (9/14) by the total number of passengers (84).

(9/14) * 84 = 54

This means there were 54 women on the bus initially. Now, we need to subtract the number of women who got off at the next stop, which is 20.

54 - 20 = 34

So, there are 34 women left on the bus.

"Let's figure out how many sunflowers Faraday sold. 

First, we need to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from the bouquets per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to get the number of bouquets sold per day.

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply the number of bouquets sold per day by 12 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets.

7 bouquets/day × 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers/day

Now, let's find out how many sunflowers he sold per day from the individual sunflowers. Since each sunflower costs $2 and he earned $26 from the sunflowers per day, we can divide $26 by $2 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day.

$26 ÷ $2 = 13 sunflowers/day

Now, we can add the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets and the individual sunflowers to get the total number of sunflowers sold per day.

84 sunflowers/day + 13 sunflowers/day = 97 sunflowers/day

Finally, we can multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by the number of days to get the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

97 sunflowers/day × 3 days = 291 sunflowers

Adam has $100 to spend on rocks. He buys rocks for $5 each and sells them for $7 each. He wants to know how much money he loses if he only sells 60% of his rocks.

First, we need to find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. We do this by dividing $100 by $5:

$100 ÷ $5 = 20 rocks

Now, we need to find out how many rocks Adam sells. Since he sells 60% of his rocks, we multiply 20 by 0.6:

20 x 0.6 = 12 rocks

Adam sells 12 rocks for $7 each. To find out how much money he makes, we multiply 12 by $7:

12 x $7 = $84

Now, we need to find out how much money Adam spends on rocks. He buys 20 rocks for $5 each, so we multiply 20 by $5:

20 x $5 = $100

But Adam only sells 12 rocks, so he still has 8 rocks left. He has to pay for these rocks, which cost $5 each. We multiply 8 by $5:

8 x $5 = $40

The total amount Adam spends on rocks is $100 (for the rocks he sold) + $40 (for the rocks he didn't sell):

$100 + $40 = $140

Now, we need to find out how much money Adam loses. We subtract the money he made ($84) from the total amount he spent ($140):

$140 - $84 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"Lauren is a cartoonist who can draw different sizes of picture scenes. She can draw 5 big scenes, 6 medium scenes, or 7 small scenes in a day. She has to draw 45 big scenes, 36 medium scenes, and 49 small scenes for a project.

To find out how many days it will take her to finish the project, we need to divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw in a day for each size.

For big scenes: 45 ÷ 5 = 9 days
For medium scenes: 36 ÷ 6 = 6 days
For small scenes: 49 ÷ 7 = 7 days

Since Lauren can't finish the project in less than 9 days, it will take her 9 days to complete the project.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many eggs each child gets, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, we need to figure out how many eggs Chatty has in total. Since she prepared three dozen eggs, and a dozen is 12, we multiply 3 by 12 to get the total number of eggs. 

3 x 12 = 36 eggs

Now, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. There are 4 kids. 

36 ÷ 4 = 9 eggs per child

So, each child gets 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to know how much she spends per day and multiply it by the number of days in May.

Each fish needs $1 worth of food per day, and Jen has 3 fish. So, the total cost per day is 3 x $1 = $3.

May has 31 days. To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days: $3 x 31 = $93.

The final answer is: $93"
"Let's figure out how many roses Patricia has now.

First, we need to know how many roses Patricia had at the beginning. She had 30 roses.

Then, she gave 24 roses to her mom. To find out how many roses she has left, we need to subtract 24 from 30.

30 - 24 = 6

So, Patricia has 6 roses left.

Next, she bought 15 more roses. To find out how many roses she has now, we need to add 15 to 6.

6 + 15 = 21

Now, Patricia has 21 roses.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the average speed, we need to know the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, and then he traveled 140 miles in 3 hours. 

First, let's add up the total distance: 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

Next, we need to add up the total time: 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time: 

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour

The final answer is: 50"
"So, let's say Mark buys two lottery tickets. One ticket has a 20% chance of winning, and the other ticket has a 60% chance of winning because it's three times more likely to win.

To find the probability that both tickets win, we need to multiply the chances of each ticket winning. 

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form. The second ticket has a 60% chance of winning, which is 0.6 in decimal form.

So, we multiply 0.2 and 0.6 to get the probability of both tickets winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"Let's figure out how many seashells each person gets.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells. This is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, if we let C be the number of seashells Carlos collected, we can write an equation: C + 5 = 27.

To find out how many seashells Carlos collected, we need to solve for C. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:

C + 5 = 27
C + 5 - 5 = 27 - 5
C = 22

Now we know that Carlos collected 22 seashells. We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. If we let R be the number of seashells Carrey collected, we can write another equation: 2R = 22.

To find out how many seashells Carrey collected, we need to solve for R. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

2R = 22
2R / 2 = 22 / 2
R = 11

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells, Carlos collected 22 seashells, and Jim collected 27 seashells.

Now, let's add up all the seashells: 11 + 22 + 27 = 60.

To find out how many seashells each person gets, we need to divide the total number of seashells by 3 (the number of people):

60 ÷ 3 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's figure out how many carrots Mason eats in a week.

Mason eats 4 carrots each day from Monday to Friday. That's 5 days. So, we multiply 4 carrots by 5 days to find out how many carrots he eats on weekdays.

4 carrots/day × 5 days = 4 × 5 = 20 carrots

Then, Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday. That's 2 days. So, we multiply 5 carrots by 2 days to find out how many carrots he eats on the weekend.

5 carrots/day × 2 days = 5 × 2 = 10 carrots

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week.

20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekend) = 30 carrots

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to find the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is 60% as a decimal).

5 × 0.6 = 3 minutes

So the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes and 8 minutes. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

The final answer is: 13"
"Let's figure out how much profit Linus made from selling the mobile devices.

First, we need to find out how much he spent on the devices and how much he got from selling them. 

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday for $20 each. So, the total cost price for Monday is 2 x $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 x $20 = $40. So, the total selling price for Monday is 2 x $40 = $80. To find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price: $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost price for Tuesday is 4 x $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 x $20 = $40. So, the total selling price for Tuesday is 4 x $40 = $160. To find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price: $160 - $80 = $80.

Now, we add the profit from Monday and Tuesday to find the total profit: $40 + $80 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's figure out how long Carl's cane is. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and she's taller than her cousin Ned. We also know that Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

To find out how tall Ned is, we need to subtract 2 feet from Isabel's height. 
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Now, we know that Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned. 
Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, we need to divide his height by 2 to find the length of the cane. 
Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to know how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy needs.

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

Now, to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we multiply the number of bottles needed for one person by 2300: 5 * 2300 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Carla has 8 babies, and she dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue. To find out how many babies are wearing purple, we multiply 3/4 by 8.

3/4 × 8 = 6

So, 6 babies are wearing purple. Since 1/4 of the babies are wearing blue, that means 2 babies are wearing blue.

Now, we need to find out how many babies are wearing purple and bows. Since 1/3 of the purple babies are wearing bows, we multiply 1/3 by 6.

1/3 × 6 = 2

This means 2 babies wearing purple are also wearing bows. We also know that 2 babies wearing blue are wearing bows.

So, in total, 2 + 2 = 4 babies are wearing bows.

Now, we need to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. To do this, we divide the number of babies wearing purple and bows by the total number of babies wearing bows, and then multiply by 100.

(2 ÷ 4) × 100 = 50%

So, the answer is 50%."
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to know how many they got in total and how many they got on other days. 

The IRS got a total of 5168 tax reports last week. On Monday and Tuesday, they got 1907 reports. On Thursday and Friday, they got 2136 reports. 

To find out how many they got on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports they got on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports they got last week. 

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136
Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, we subtract the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The final answer is: 1125"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Abraham has 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50. To find half of 80, we divide 80 by 2. 

80 ÷ 2 = 40 square meters

So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Next, he sold 1/4 of his land for $30. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4 or divide 80 by 4.

80 ÷ 4 = 20 square meters

He sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, let's find out how much land is left. We subtract the land he sold from the total land.

80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. To find the total amount of money he earned from this sale, we multiply 20 by 3.

20 × 3 = $60

Now, let's add up the money he earned from all the sales.

$50 + $30 + $60 = $140

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old. Half of 26 is 26 ÷ 2 = 13.

13 - 10 = 3.

So, Geb is 3 years old."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses in 2 days, we need to know how many face masks he uses in a day. Since he goes out 3 times a day and changes his face mask 2 times every time he goes out, we multiply the number of times he goes out by the number of times he changes his mask.

3 (times he goes out) * 2 (times he changes his mask) = 6 face masks per day

Now, we need to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days. We multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2.

6 face masks per day * 2 days = 12 face masks

"Let's figure out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard.

First, we need to know how many eggs Cole hid. He hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen is 12 eggs, 3 dozen is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's find out how many eggs the others found. Lamar found 5 eggs. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so she found 2 x 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so he found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei found half as many as Charlie, so she found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs found, we add up the eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Now, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's figure out how much money John makes in a week.

First, we need to find out how many apartments John collects from in total. There are 2 apartment complexes with 200 apartments each, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find 60% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.6, which is 240. So, the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we add the apartments from all three complexes: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1 (5 years old): 50 fruits
- Year 2 (6 years old): 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 3 (7 years old): 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): We know that an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let's call the production of a 10-year-old tree 'x'. So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.
- Year 5 (9 years old): 0 fruits (no production)
- Year 6 (10 years old): 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we need to find the production of a 10-year-old tree. We know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. 

Now we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 1000, x = 1200. 

So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1200 - 200 = 1000 fruits.

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1000 + 0 + 1000 = 1550

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope. If we call the length of the blue rope ""B"", then the length of the red rope is 4B.

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If we call the length of the yellow rope ""Y"", then the length of the blue rope is Y - 7.

We are also given that the total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. So, we can write an equation: R + B + Y = 37.

Since R = 4B, we can substitute this into the equation: 4B + B + Y = 37.

Combine like terms: 5B + Y = 37.

Now, substitute B = Y - 7 into the equation: 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37.

Distribute the 5: 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms: 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides: 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6: Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7: B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B: R = 4 * 5 = 20.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we know that Rissa got three times as much money as Ronnie. If Ronnie got $5, then Rissa got 3 x $5 = $15.

Now, let's say they both gave an equal amount of money to their little sister. We'll call the amount they gave 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

We know that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money. This means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.

(15 - x) = (4/5) * 15
(15 - x) = 12
-x = 12 - 15
-x = -3
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with: $5 - x = $5 - 3 = $2.

"Let's figure out how much red paint was used in the mural.

We know that there are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. We also know that half of the mural is yellow, so the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's call the amount of each of these colors ""x"". So, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 3x.

We know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the other half is 6 pints, which is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. This means that 3x = 6.

To find out how much paint each color gets, we need to solve for x. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:

3x = 6

x = 6 ÷ 3
x = 2

Since x is the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of each, the amount of red paint is also 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom. The length is 20 feet and the width is 12 feet, so the area is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

"So, let's figure out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1. 

First, we need to find out how many pods are in the new box. The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. To find 20% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.2. That's 100 x 0.2 = 20. So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12 and you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 12. 

120 ÷ 12 = 10

So, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles with the new box for $1.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Thomas takes out $1000 in 20 dollar bills from the bank. That means he has 1000 ÷ 20 = 50 bills.

Then, he loses 10 bills on the way home. So, he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

Next, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 40 ÷ 2 = 20. So, he uses 20 bills to pay for the bill and has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

After that, he triples his money. This means he triples the number of bills, so he now has 20 × 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, he has 60 × 5 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that team A scores 4 goals in the first half. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

Now, let's think about the second half. Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

So, in the first half, team A scores 4 goals and team B scores 2 goals. In the second half, team A scores 2 goals and team B scores 8 goals.

To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we add the goals scored by both teams in both halves. Team A scores 4 + 2 = 6 goals, and team B scores 2 + 8 = 10 goals. The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

"Let's figure out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, so the remaining chalk is 55% of the original 5 inches.

To find 55% of 5 inches, we multiply 5 by 0.55.

5 x 0.55 = 2.75 inches

The teacher recycles the chalk when it's smaller than 2 inches. So, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

To find 20% of 2.75 inches, we multiply 2.75 by 0.2.

2.75 x 0.2 = 0.55 inches per day

Now, let's think about how much chalk the teacher will use each day. We can use the equation:

0.55x = 2.75

where 'x' is the number of days. To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55.

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk."
"Let's figure out how many students are not on the varsity team.

We have 12 boys and 12 girls in the class. To find out how many girls are on the varsity team, we need to divide 12 by 3 because one-third of the girls are on the team. 12 ÷ 3 = 4. So, 4 girls are on the varsity team.

To find out how many boys are on the varsity team, we need to divide 12 by 4 because one-fourth of the boys are on the team. 12 ÷ 4 = 3. So, 3 boys are on the varsity team.

Now, we add the number of girls and boys on the varsity team to find the total number of students on the team. 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

To find out how many students are not on the varsity team, we need to subtract the number of students on the team from the total number of students in the class. There are 12 boys and 12 girls, so there are 12 + 12 = 24 students in the class. 24 (total students) - 7 (students on the team) = 17.

First, we need to know how many teeth the dentist fixes. He drills 4 teeth, and then he caps 7 more teeth than that. So, he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Now, we add the teeth he drilled to the teeth he capped: 4 + 11 = 15 teeth. That's the total number of teeth the dentist fixes.

To find the percentage, we need to divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has, and then multiply by 100. So, we do 15 ÷ 30 = 0.5, and then multiply by 100 to get 50%.

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's figure out how much Mr. Marcellus got back from the company. 

First, we need to find out how many gallons of milk were bad. We know that 2/5 of the milk was bad. To find 2/5 of 4000, we can multiply 4000 by 2 and then divide by 5.

2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5
= 8000 / 5
= 1600

So, 1600 gallons of milk were bad. Now, we need to find out how much money Mr. Marcellus got back. We know that the milk cost $3.5 per gallon. To find the total refund, we multiply the number of bad gallons by the cost per gallon.

Refund = 1600 * 3.5
= 5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as an equation: W = 5(C + 7), where W is Wendy's current age and C is Colin's current age.

We also know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as another equation: C + 25 = (1/3)W.

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation. We'll replace W with 5(C + 7):
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

To get rid of the fraction, we'll multiply both sides by 3:
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)

Now, let's simplify the equation by distributing the 3 and 5:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Next, we'll subtract 3C from both sides to get all the C terms on one side:
75 = 2C + 35

Then, we'll subtract 35 from both sides to get:
40 = 2C

Finally, we'll divide both sides by 2 to solve for C:
20 = C

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's figure out how many books Bob can buy for each school.

First, we need to find out how many books Bob can buy with the money he has. We know he has $27,000 and that 100 books cost $500. To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy, we divide the total money by the cost of 100 books.

$27,000 ÷ $500 = 54

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Now, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since he's distributing the money to 3 schools, we divide the total number of sets of 100 books by 3.

54 ÷ 3 = 18

So, Bob can buy 18 sets of 100 books for each school."
"Let's figure out how many apples Newton brought home.

First, 2 apples fell out of the tree. Then, Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree. This made 5 more apples fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples. That's a total of 6 apples.

Next, he put all but 1 of the new apples in his pocket. So, he has 1 apple left outside and 5 apples in his pocket. That's still a total of 6 apples.

Then, he threw the remaining apple at the tree, and 6 more apples fell out. Now, he has 6 apples from the previous step and 6 new apples. That's a total of 12 apples.

Finally, he picked up all the remaining apples, so he now has 12 apples in total.

The answer is 12."
"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to know how many bags of coal he bought and how much each bag costs.

First, we need to find out how many bags of coal Ali bought. We know he ordered 850 kilos of coal and each bag weighs 50 kilos.

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Now, we know Ali bought 17 bags of coal. Each bag costs $18.

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 * $18
= $306

The final answer is: $306"
"To figure out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to know how many slices of each type of pizza her friends will eat. Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza. Since there are 6 friends, we multiply the number of slices each friend eats by 6.

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, so 6 friends will eat 6 x 6 = 36 slices. Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, we divide 36 by 12 to find out how many cheese pizzas Kate needs. 36 ÷ 12 = 3.

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, so 6 friends will eat 4 x 6 = 24 slices. Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we divide 24 by 8 to find out how many pepperoni pizzas Kate needs. 24 ÷ 8 = 3.

Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, so she needs to buy a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran on each day.

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. We can find the total miles he ran on these days by multiplying 3 miles by 3 days: 3 x 3 = 9 miles.

Sam also ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday. We can find the total miles he ran on these days by multiplying 5 miles by 2 days: 5 x 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days: 9 + 10 = 19 miles.

The final answer is: 19"
"Let's figure out how long it will take Jay to make 60 snowballs.

Jay can make 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. To find out how many snowballs he makes per minute, we divide 20 by 60. That's 20 ÷ 60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

But, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, we need to find out how many snowballs melt per minute. We divide 2 by 15, which is 2 ÷ 15 = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find the net rate of snowballs. We subtract the melting rate from the building rate: 1/3 - 2/15. To do this, we need to find a common denominator, which is 15. So, we rewrite 1/3 as 5/15. Now we can subtract: 5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15. We can simplify this by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3, which gives us 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, we need to find out how long it will take to make 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute. We can do this by dividing 60 by 1/5. To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. So, 60 ÷ 1/5 = 60 × 5 = 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to make 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find Jim's age, we need to figure out how old he was 20 years ago. Since John is 28 now, we subtract 20 from 28 to find John's age 20 years ago: 28 - 20 = 8.

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we divide John's age 20 years ago by 2 to find Jim's age 20 years ago: 8 ÷ 2 = 4.

Now, we add 20 to Jim's age 20 years ago to find his current age: 4 + 20 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Doxa sliced an apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, we need to add up the number of slices each person ate: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's figure out how many bandages they started with.

We know they used 38 bandages on the first day and ordered 1 pack of 50. That means they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left after the first day.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. That means they had 12 + 50 - 28 = 34 bandages left after the second day.

On the third day, they ordered 2 packs of 50 bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. That means they had 34 + 100 - 25 = 109 bandages after the third day. But we know they had 78 bandages left, so they must have had 109 - 78 = 31 bandages left over from the first two days.

Since they had 12 bandages left after the first day, that means they had 31 - 12 = 19 bandages left over from the second day. But we know they used 28 bandages on the second day, so they must have had 19 + 28 = 47 bandages at the start of the second day.

Now, we know they used 38 bandages on the first day, so they must have had 47 + 38 = 85 bandages at the start of the first day.

The final answer is: 85"
"So May is getting her hair cut and colored. Let's figure out how much it costs. The color costs $40. The haircut costs $30 per inch. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches. We need to find the difference in length to know how much the haircut costs.

To find the difference, we subtract the final length from the initial length: 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

Now, we multiply the difference in length by the cost per inch: 2 inches * $30/inch = $60.

Adding the cost of the color: $60 + $40 = $100.

So, the total cost of the haircut and color is $100."
"Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. We need to find out how much she earns in a month. 

First, let's find out how many hours she works in a month. There are 4 weeks in April, and she works 6 days a week. So, she works 4 x 6 = 24 days in April. Since she works 7.5 hours a day, she works a total of 24 x 7.5 = 180 hours in April.

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so we multiply the total hours she works by her hourly rate to find her regular pay: 180 x $1.5 = $270.

Jen also gets a $10 bonus for each day she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences for the entire month, she gets the bonus for all 24 days. So, her attendance bonus is 24 x $10 = $240.

Now, let's add her regular pay and attendance bonus to find her total earnings: $270 + $240 = $510.

The final answer is: $510"
"Let's figure out how much money Jason earned. We need to add up the money he got for doing his chores.

Jason got $3.00 for doing his laundry. He did it once, so that's $3.00.

He got $1.50 for cleaning his room. He did it once, so that's $1.50.

He got $0.75 for taking the trash out. He did it twice, so we need to multiply $0.75 by 2. That's $0.75 x 2 = $1.50.

He got $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher. He did it 6 times, so we need to multiply $0.50 by 6. That's $0.50 x 6 = $3.00.

Now, let's add up all the money he got: $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00.

The final answer is: $8.00"
"So, let's figure out how much blood ten sharks have. We know that a whale has 40 gallons of blood, and a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. To find out how much blood a shark has, we multiply the amount of blood in a whale by 3.

So, 3 x 40 = 120 gallons of blood in a shark.

Now, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. We can do this by multiplying the amount of blood in one shark by 10.

120 x 10 = 1200 gallons of blood in ten sharks.

The final answer is: 1200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find the total number of people who entered the restaurant.

First, 50 people came in the morning. Then, 40 more people came in at 10:00. We need to add these two numbers together: 50 + 40 = 90.

Next, twice the number of people who came in at 10:00 came in for lunch. Since 40 people came in at 10:00, twice that number is 2 x 40 = 80. We add this to the previous total: 90 + 80 = 170.

Finally, 3 times the number of people who came in the morning came in by evening. Since 50 people came in the morning, 3 times that number is 3 x 50 = 150. We add this to the previous total: 170 + 150 = 320.

"Let's figure out how many pens Alain has. His mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, we multiply 5 packs by 5 pens/pack to get the total number of red pens: 5 x 5 = 25 red pens.

Now, we know Alain's mom bought twice as many black pens as red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, we multiply 25 by 2 to get the number of black pens: 25 x 2 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens: 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. To find out how much one bottle costs, we need to divide the total cost by the number of bottles. 

$600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle of scotch.

Now, we know that John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. So, he buys 2 x 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. To find the cost of one bottle of cognac, we need to add 50% of $60 to $60. 

50% of $60 is $60 x 0.5 = $30. 

So, the cost of one bottle of cognac is $60 + $30 = $90.

Now, we need to find the total cost of the cognac. We multiply the cost of one bottle of cognac by the number of bottles: 

$90 x 20 = $1800.

Finally, we need to find the total cost of everything. We add the cost of the scotch and the cognac: 

$600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 x 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day. To find 1/4 of 40, we multiply 40 by 1/4, which is 40 x 1/4 = 10. So, he planted 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day. In total, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's add the total number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days:
White Oak: 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Lodgepole Pine: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 30 + 90 = 120.

"Let's figure out how much root beer was left for the party.

Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day. Then, his kids drank 4 gallons, so we subtract 4 from 24: 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

Next, his wife spilled 7 gallons, so we subtract 7 from 20: 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

Then, his friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, so we subtract 5 from 13: 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

Now, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the root beer equally. To find out how much each person got, we divide 8 by 3: 8 ÷ 3 = 2.67 gallons.

"Let's solve the problem together.

The problem says that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 40. We can write this as an equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to get x all by itself. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to find the value of x:

x = 32 ÷ 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's solve the problem. We have 66 fish in the tank. We need to find out how many fish have red stripes and blue stripes.

First, we need to find out how many fish have red stripes. To do this, we divide 66 by 3.

66 ÷ 3 = 22

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find out how many fish have blue stripes. We know that 22 fish have red stripes, so we need to find out how many fish are left.

66 - 22 = 44

Now, we need to find 5/11 of 44.

5/11 × 44 = 20

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes.

22 (red stripes) + 20 (blue stripes) = 42

"Let's figure out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left.

Amy has 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each. That's 2 x 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also has 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each. That's 3 x 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

So, Amy has 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors in total.

Her sister takes one of the palettes, so Amy loses 4 eyeshadow colors. Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.

Then, Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. There are 6 colors in a makeup set, and half of that is 3. So, Amy uses up 3 eyeshadow colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know Mattison is 60 inches tall. His house is 7 times as high as he is, so we multiply 60 by 7 to find the total height of the house:
7 × 60 = 420 inches

Now, we're told the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison. We multiply 60 by 3 to find the height of the first floor:
3 × 60 = 180 inches

Since the house is 420 inches tall and the first floor is 180 inches, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the first floor's height from the total height of the house:
420 - 180 = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor. To do this, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor, because the roof is above the second floor. So, we subtract 240 from 180:
180 - 240 = -60

Wait, that's not right. We can't have a negative number for height. Let's try again. We need to subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor, but we need to do it in the correct order. We should subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house, and then subtract the height of the first floor from that result. Here's the correct calculation:
420 - 240 = 180
180 - 180 = 0

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 0 inches."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many shells team Alphas found. To do this, we need to find 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 × 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find out how many shells are left after team Alphas found their share. 

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find out how many shells team The finders found. They found 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 × 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find out how many shells team Gogetters found. 

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)

"Let's figure out how many miles the last dog needs to walk.

We know that the first dog needs to walk 1 mile, the second dog needs to walk 4 miles, and the third dog needs to walk 3 miles. To find the total miles walked by these three dogs, we add their individual miles: 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs and they need to walk an average of 3 miles per day, the total miles walked by all 4 dogs should be 4 * 3 = 12 miles.

Now, to find the miles walked by the last dog, we subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all 4 dogs: 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

The last dog needs 4 miles."
"So John wants to get a loan to pay off his debts. His house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan for 40% of that. To find 40% of $250,000, we multiply 0.4 by $250,000.

0.4 × $250,000 = $100,000

Now, he uses 60% of this loan to pay off his debts. To find 60% of $100,000, we multiply 0.6 by $100,000.

0.6 × $100,000 = $60,000

To find out how much money he has leftover, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the amount borrowed.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

So, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts."
"Let's figure out how much Deandre will earn from selling the tunas.

First, we need to find the total weight of the tunas. We can do this by adding the weights of all three tunas together.

Weight of the first tuna = 56 kilograms
Weight of the second tuna = 46 kilograms
Weight of the last tuna = 26 kilograms

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Now, we need to find out how much money Deandre will get for each kilogram of tuna. We are told that a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50.

To find the total earnings, we multiply the total weight of the tunas by the cost per kilogram.

Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

So, Deandre will earn $64 from selling all the tunas.

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to know how much she sells the magazines for and how much she bought them for. 

She bought the magazines for $72. To find out how much she sells them for, we need to multiply the cost price by 11/8. 

Let's do the math: 

Cost price = $72
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

So, Trinity's profit is $27."
"So, Brian has a dehumidifier that can work on three different speeds: low, medium, and high. He tested it and found out that the low setting removes 1 liter of water from the air per day. The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which means it removes 2 liters of water per day. The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters of water per day.

Brian used the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, which means it removed 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters of water. Then, he used it for 3 days on the medium setting, which means it removed 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters of water. Finally, he used it for 5 days on the high setting, which means it removed 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters of water.

To find the total amount of water removed, we need to add up the water removed on each setting: 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we need to know how many balloons Jolene and her friends started with and how many were left. They filled up 10 packs of balloons, and each pack has 30 balloons. So, we multiply 10 packs by 30 balloons per pack to get the total number of balloons.

10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons

Now, we need to subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons to find out how many were thrown. We know that 12 balloons were left.

300 - 12 = 288

So, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons.

The final answer is: 288"
"To find the total amount of the second medicine, we need to multiply the first medicine by 3. The first medicine is 14 mL, so 3 times that amount is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Now, we need to find the total amount of both medicines in one dose. The first medicine is 14 mL and the second medicine is 42 mL, so the total amount in one dose is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8. 

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"So, let's figure out the combined capacity of both schools. We know that Ali's class has 120 students. We also know that John's classes have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. 

To find 1/8 of 120, we can divide 120 by 8. That's 120 ÷ 8 = 15 students per class. Since John has two classes, we multiply 15 by 2 to get the total capacity of his classes. That's 15 * 2 = 30 students.

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's class to the capacity of John's classes to get the combined capacity of both schools. That's 120 + 30 = 150 students.

The final answer is: 150"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. This means he has to pay back the original $300 plus 2% of $300 as interest.

To find 2% of $300, we multiply 300 by 0.02. This is the same as multiplying 300 by 2 and then dividing by 100. 

300 * 2 = 600
600 ÷ 100 = 6

So, Stephen owes his sister $6 in interest.

Now, Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months. To find the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months, we multiply 25 by 11.

25 * 11 = 275

The remaining amount, including the interest, that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the initial amount plus the interest minus the amount he paid in the first 11 months.

300 + 6 - 275 = 31

First, we need to find out how many diapers are changed in total. Since each child needs 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 kids, we multiply 2 kids by 5 diaper changes per day. That's 2 x 5 = 10 diaper changes per day.

Now, we know that Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. To find out how many diapers she changes, we divide the total number of diaper changes by 2. So, 10 ÷ 2 = 5 diapers changed by Jordan's wife.

Since Jordan's wife changes 5 diapers, that means Jordan changes the other 5 diapers. Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's figure out how far off Tim's guess was. 

First, we need to find the total volume of the jar. The jar is a square base with sides of 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. To find the volume, we multiply the length, width, and height of the jar.

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed tightly, we need to find 80% of the total volume to get the actual space used by the jelly beans.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. To find the total number of jelly beans, we divide the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans he guessed.

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we know the bus can hold 200 people. When it started, there were 20 people on the bus. Then, 40 people got on at the first stop. So, we add 40 to 20 to get 60 people.

60 + 40 = 60

Now, at the second stop, 3/4 of the people who got on at the first stop got on the bus. We need to find 3/4 of 40. To do that, we multiply 40 by 3 and then divide by 4.

(3/4) * 40 = (3 * 40) / 4
= 120 / 4
= 30

So, 30 people got on at the second stop. Now, we add 30 to 60 to get 90 people.

60 + 30 = 90

At the third stop, the number of people on the bus doubled. To double 90, we multiply it by 2.

2 * 90 = 180

Now, we know there are 200 people the bus can hold, and there are 180 people on the bus. To find out how many more people can get on, we subtract 180 from 200.

200 - 180 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's figure out how much money Pauline spent on visiting the museum.

First, we need to find out how much she spent in the first 5 years. Since she visits the museum 3 times a year, and each visit costs $2, we multiply 3 and 2 to get the annual cost, which is $6. Now, we multiply the annual cost by 5 to get the total cost for 5 years, which is $6 * 5 = $30.

Now, let's find out how much she spent in the next 3 years. The cost of one visit increased by 150%, which means it's now $2 + $3 = $5. So, the new annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. Now, we multiply the new annual cost by 3 to get the total cost for the next 3 years, which is $15 * 3 = $45.

To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we add the cost of the first 5 years and the next 3 years, which is $30 + $45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To figure out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to know how many groups of 8 students can be made from the total number of students. There are 4 grades at Cedar Falls Middle School, and each grade has 10 students. So, we multiply the number of grades by the number of students in each grade: 4 * 10 = 40 students.

Now, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group: 40 ÷ 8 = 5. This means we can make 5 groups of 8 students.

Since each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room, we multiply the number of groups by the time it takes for each group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"
"So, John is a carpenter and he made some stuff for his friend Ali. He made 4 tables for $20 each and 2 roof frames for $10 each. We need to find out how much Ali has to pay John.

First, let's find out how much the tables cost. We multiply the number of tables by the price of each table: 4 x $20 = $80.

Next, we find out how much the roof frames cost. We multiply the number of frames by the price of each frame: 2 x $10 = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames to find the total: $80 + $20 = $100.

So, Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Ian has a board that is 40 feet long, and he wants to cut it into two pieces. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece.

Let's say the shorter piece is x feet long. Then, the longer piece is 4x feet long. Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can write an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Now, we need to find the value of x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 40 ÷ 5
x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4(8)
4x = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

The final answer is: 32"
"To figure out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we need to know how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed ÷ Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 ÷ 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now, we need to find out how much seasoning Aiden needs for 5 pounds of meat. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, so we multiply the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed × Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 × 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"So, Luke wants to buy fabric for his curtains. He has 5 windows, and each one is 35 inches wide. He needs to buy fabric that's 2 times the total width of all the windows. 

First, we need to find the total width of all the windows. We do this by multiplying the width of one window by the number of windows. 

35 inches (width of one window) × 5 (number of windows) = 175 inches

Now, we need to multiply the total width by 2 to find out how much fabric Luke needs to buy.

2 × 175 inches = 350 inches

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To find the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the rest of the call.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is 16 x $0.25 = $4.

For the rest of the call, which is 36 - 16 = 20 minutes, the cost is 20 x $0.2 = $4.

So, the total cost of the call is $4 + $4 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"So, let's figure out how much rain will fall on Tuesday. We know it rained 2 inches on Monday. Now, we need to find out how much it will rain on Tuesday. The problem says it will rain 1 more inch than twice the amount of Monday's total.

First, we need to find twice the amount of Monday's total. To do that, we multiply 2 (Monday's total) by 2. That's 2 x 2 = 4 inches.

Now, we need to add 1 more inch to that. So, we add 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

So, there will be 5 inches of rain on Tuesday.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If we let the number of cupcakes be x, then the number of brownies is 3x - 2.

Since each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Now, let's solve the equation:

x + 3x - 2 = 10
Combine like terms: 4x - 2 = 10
Add 2 to both sides: 4x = 12
Divide both sides by 4: x = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find out how much Karen will pay, we need to do some math. 

First, let's find the discount on the manicure and pedicure. The manicure costs $35, and the discount is 20% of that. To find 20% of $35, we multiply 35 by 0.2. That's 35 × 0.2 = $7. 

The pedicure costs $40, and the discount is 20% of that. To find 20% of $40, we multiply 40 by 0.2. That's 40 × 0.2 = $8.

The total discount is $7 + $8 = $15.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the cost of the manicure and pedicure. The manicure costs $35, and after the discount, it's $35 - $7 = $28. The pedicure costs $40, and after the discount, it's $40 - $8 = $32.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $28 + $32 = $60.

Next, we need to add the cost of the nail art. Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers. The nail art costs $3 per finger, so the total cost of the nail art is 10 × $3 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"Let's figure out how many magazines Susan gets every year. We know she has 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each. That's 3 x 12 = 36 issues.

Then, there's one magazine that sends 6 issues a year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 x 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan gets 66 magazines every year."
"Let's figure out how many paintings Kim has.

We know that Samantha has 27 paintings. We also know that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. To find out how many paintings Shelley has, we need to add 12 to 27. 

27 + 12 = 39

So, Shelley has 39 paintings. Now, we know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we need to subtract 8 from 39.

39 - 8 = 31

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to do some math.

First, we need to find the price of the toy in December. The price increased by 80% from $40. To find 80% of $40, we multiply $40 by 0.8 (since 80% is the same as 80/100 or 0.8). 

0.8 * $40 = $32

Now, we add the increase to the original price to get the new price in December:
$40 + $32 = $72

Next, we need to find the price of the toy in January. The price decreased by 50% from $72. To find 50% of $72, we multiply $72 by 0.5 (since 50% is the same as 50/100 or 0.5).

0.5 * $72 = $36

Now, we subtract the decrease from the price in December to get the new price in January:
$72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"So Charlie is a tennis pro and he teaches people how to play tennis. He charges $80 per hour for his lessons, but if the person is a veteran, he charges less. He reduces his rate by 25% for veterans.

Let's figure out how much money Charlie will make today. He has 4 lessons at his regular rate and 2 lessons with a veteran. 

First, let's find out how much money he makes from the regular lessons. He has 4 lessons at $80 each, so we multiply 4 and 80 to get the total.

4 x $80 = $320

Now, let's find out how much money he makes from the lessons with the veteran. He reduces his rate by 25%, so he charges 75% of his regular rate. To find 75% of $80, we multiply 80 by 0.75 (since 75% is the same as 0.75).

$80 x 0.75 = $60

Now, we multiply $60 by 2 to find out how much money he makes from the lessons with the veteran.

$60 x 2 = $120

Now, we add the money he makes from the regular lessons and the lessons with the veteran to find the total amount of money he makes.

$320 + $120 = $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630. Now, we need to divide by the total number of scores, which is 9.

To do this, we can use division: 630 ÷ 9 = 70

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we need to figure out how many pomelos she has left.

Since she has 1/4 of the original amount left, we can multiply 20 by 1/4 to find out how many pomelos she has left. We can write this as a multiplication problem:

20 × (1/4) = ?

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the number by the numerator (1) and then divide by the denominator (4). So, we get:

20 × 1 = 20
20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, Eve has 5 pomelos left. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we need to subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original amount:

20 - 5 = 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Walter bought 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them. To find out how many apples he ate, we need to multiply 60 by 2/5.

60 × (2/5) = (2 × 60) ÷ 5
= 120 ÷ 5
= 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples are left.

60 - 24 = 36

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25.

36 × 0.25 = 9

Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples are left.

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply 27 by 3.

27 × 3 = $81

"Let's figure out how many novels Regina wrote this year. We know she wrote 9 novels last year, and that's 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year. To find out the total number of novels she wrote this year, we need to find out what 1 quarter of the novels is and then multiply it by 4.

If 9 novels is 3 quarters, then 1 quarter is 9 divided by 3.

9 ÷ 3 = 3

Now, we multiply 3 by 4 to find the total number of novels she wrote this year.

3 × 4 = 12

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year."
"To find out how much of the distance Michael covered, we need to know how far he traveled in 3 days. 

Since there are 24 hours in a day, Michael traveled for 3 x 24 = 72 hours.

To find the distance he covered, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled. 

Distance covered = Speed x Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr x 72 hr
Distance covered = 3600 km

Now, we need to find what percentage of the distance he covered. 

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) x 100
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) x 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 x 100
Percentage covered = 60%

So, Michael covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas."
"Let's figure out how many grapes were there at the beginning.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a glass of juice, so he used 6 x 5 = 30 grapes.

Now, let's add the grapes Madeline and her brother used: 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mom used the remaining grapes to make pies. Each pie needs 12 grapes, and she made 3 pies, so she used 3 x 12 = 36 grapes.

We know that the total number of grapes used is 36 (by Madeline) + 30 (by her brother) + 36 (by their mom) = 102 grapes.

Since the mom used all the remaining grapes, that means there were 102 grapes in total.

The final answer is: 102"

First, let's find out how many teachers were not sick. We know there were 82 teachers in total and 13 were sick. So, we subtract 13 from 82 to find out how many teachers were not sick.

82 - 13 = 69

Now, we know there were 9 substitute teachers. To find the total number of teachers at school, we add the number of teachers who were not sick to the number of substitute teachers.

69 + 9 = 78

So, there were 78 teachers at school that day."
"To find out how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to know how much it costs him to make it each week. 

First, let's find out how much the pasta costs. It costs $1.00 per box. 

Next, we need to find out how much the cheese costs. The cheddar cheese costs $3.00. The gruyere cheese costs twice as much as the cheddar cheese, so it costs 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

Now, we add up the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese to find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese each week. The total cost is $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the weekly cost by 52 to find the yearly cost. The yearly cost is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To find out what percentage of their day the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, we need to know a few things. They have to clean 80 classrooms, and it takes them 15 minutes per classroom. They have 5 days to get it done, and they work 8 hours a day.

First, let's find out how many hours they have to clean in total. Since they work 8 hours a day for 5 days, that's 8 * 5 = 40 hours.

Now, let's find out how many hours it takes to clean all the classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, and there are 80 classrooms, that's 80 * 15 minutes = 1200 minutes. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1200 / 60 = 20 hours.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms by dividing the time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiplying by 100: (20 / 40) * 100 = 50%.

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's figure out how many bookcases Elly needs to hold all her books. 

We know that each middle shelf can hold 10 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's find out how many books one bookcase can hold. We add up the books on each shelf: 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are needed to hold all of them. We can do this by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 ÷ 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Rose paid for the eggs. She bought 5 dozen eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen.

5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Rose bought 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Now, let's find out how much money Rose will make from selling the eggs. She sells 3 eggs for $1. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell, we divide the total number of eggs by 3.

60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Since she sells each set for $1, the total money she will make is:

20 sets * $1/set = $20

To find out how much profit Rose made, we subtract the total cost from the total money she made.

Profit = Total Money Made - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

"Let's figure out how many white hats Skyler has. We know he has 100 hats in total.

First, we need to find out how many red hats he has. Since half of the hats are red, we can multiply 100 by 1/2 (which is the same as 0.5) to get the number of red hats.

100 x 1/2 = 100 x 0.5 = 50

So, Skyler has 50 red hats. Now, we need to find out how many hats are left. We subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.

100 - 50 = 50

Now, we know that 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find out how many blue hats there are, we multiply 50 by 3/5.

50 x 3/5 = 50 x 0.6 = 30

Now, we need to find out how many white hats there are. We know that the remaining hats are white, so we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats.

50 - 30 = 20

So, Skyler has 20 white hats.

The final answer is: 20"
"So, let's figure out how much each stick of beef jerky costs. 

First, we need to find out how much the bag costs after the discount. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, we subtract the discount from the original price:

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Now, we need to convert the price to cents because we want to know the cost per stick in cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so we multiply the price by 100:

$15.00 × 100 = 1500 cents

Next, we need to find out how much each stick costs. There are 30 sticks in a bag, so we divide the total cost by the number of sticks:

1500 ÷ 30 = 50 cents

So, each stick of beef jerky costs 50 cents.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Mary makes some strawberry cubes and some blueberry cubes. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes a total of 116 ice cubes, we need to find out how many blueberry cubes she makes.

Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is S. Then the number of blueberry cubes is 5S - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so the number of strawberry cubes plus the number of blueberry cubes is 116. We can write this as an equation:

S + (5S - 4) = 116

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20

Now that we know S, we can find the number of blueberry cubes: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the total number of points Ara scored in four years, we need to multiply the number of games she played each year by her score per game and then multiply the result by the number of years.

First, we multiply the number of games she played each year by her score per game: 40 games/year * 21 points/game = 840 points/year

Then, we multiply the result by the number of years: 840 points/year * 4 years = 3360 points

So, Ara scored a total of 3360 points in four years.

The final answer is: 3360"

"Let's count the flashlights and candles that Brianna's family is using.

First, we need to count the flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, we need to count the candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

To find the total number of candles, we add the small and medium candles together: 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to first find the total number of chips. Mitchell buys two bags of chips with 55 chips each, so the total number of chips is 2 x 55 = 110.

Now, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members to find out how many chips each person gets. There are 5 family members, so we divide 110 by 5.

110 ÷ 5 = 22

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to add up the time it takes for each side. 

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each. 
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides: 
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

The final answer is: 30"
"So, let's figure out how many items Dominick saw in the changing room. We know there are 20 helmets. Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can find the number of robots by dividing 20 by 2. That's 20 ÷ 2 = 10 robots.

Now, we know there are half as many helmets as footballs. So, if there are 20 helmets, there must be 20 x 2 = 40 footballs.

To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs together: 10 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (football) = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to know how many hours he works and how long each call takes. Tim works 6 hours a day, and each call takes 15 minutes. 

First, we need to change the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we can divide the total hours Tim spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call: 6 hours / 0.25 hours per call = 24 calls per day.

To find out how many calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by 5: 24 calls per day * 5 days = 120 calls.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much longer it takes for the new varnish to dry, we need to know how long it takes for the old varnish to dry and the new varnish to dry.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting. If Louise has 6 paintings, we multiply 7 minutes by 6 to get the total time: 7 x 6 = 42 minutes.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. If Louise has 6 paintings, we multiply 12 minutes by 6 to get the total time: 12 x 6 = 72 minutes.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two times: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much water Crista needs for her plants, we need to figure out how much water each type of plant needs and add them together.

First, we know that 4 of her plants need half a cup of water each. We can write this as 4 x 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, 8 of her plants need 1 cup of water each. This is easy to calculate: 8 x 1 = 8 cups.

Now, we need to find out how much water the rest of the plants need. There are 20 plants in total, and we've already counted 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the rest of the plants are 20 - 12 = 8 plants. These plants need a quarter of a cup of water each, which is 0.25 cups. We can calculate this as 8 x 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, we add the water needed for each type of plant: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how long it will take Phineas to get back home, we need to figure out how long it takes him to hop and swim half of the distance. Since he's 200 yards away from home, we divide that by 2 to get the distance for each part. 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes him to hop 100 yards on land. He hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so we divide the distance by his speed: 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to swim 100 yards in the water. He swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so we divide the distance by his speed: 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the time it takes to hop and the time it takes to swim: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how much it will cost Bob to build his project, we need to know how many boxes of popsicle sticks he needs to buy.

First, we need to divide the number of popsicle sticks needed by the number of popsicle sticks per box. 

Number of popsicle sticks needed: 56
Popsicle sticks per box: 8
Number of boxes needed: 56 ÷ 8 = 7

Now, we need to find the total cost of the boxes. 

Cost per box: $2.00
Number of boxes needed: 7
Total cost: 7 × $2.00 = $14.00

"Let's figure out how much the whole phone plan costs.

We know there are five phones on the plan. The main phone costs twice as much as each of the other phones. If the main phone costs $20, we need to find out how much each of the other phones costs.

Let's call the cost of each of the other phones ""x"". Since the main phone costs twice as much as each of the other phones, the main phone costs 2x.

We know the main phone costs $20, so we can write an equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2:

2x / 2 = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know each of the other phones costs $10, we need to find the total cost of the other phones. There are 4 other phones, so the total cost of the other phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the other phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

The final answer is: $60"
"Derrick's bakery makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. We need to figure out how much money he makes in June if he sells all the doughnuts.

First, let's find out how many doughnuts Derrick makes in a day. Since 1 dozen is 12, we multiply 10 dozen by 12 to get the total number of doughnuts. That's 10 x 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

Now, we need to know how much money Derrick makes from selling these doughnuts. Each doughnut costs $2. So, we multiply the number of doughnuts by the price of each doughnut: 120 x $2 = $240 per day.

June has 30 days. To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we multiply the amount he makes in a day by the number of days in June: $240 x 30 = $7200.

The final answer is: $7200"

First, let's find out how many photos she can upload per day. She uploads 6 batches per day, and each batch has 7 photos. So, the number of photos she can upload per day is 6 x 7 = 42.

Now, let's divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload per day: 210 ÷ 42 = 5.

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all her photos."
"To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to calculate the cost for each item and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

First, let's find the cost for the blouses. There are 5 blouses and they cost $5 each. So, the cost for the blouses is 5 x $5 = $25.

Next, we need to find the cost for the skirt. There is 1 skirt and it costs $6. So, the cost for the skirt is 1 x $6 = $6.

Now, let's find the cost for the pants. There are 2 pants and they cost $8 each. So, the cost for the pants is 2 x $8 = $16.

Now, we add up the cost for the blouses, skirt, and pants to get the total cost per week. $25 + $6 + $16 = $47.

To find the total cost for 5 weeks, we multiply the total cost per week by 5. $47 x 5 = $235.

"So, John wants to know how long it'll take him to talk 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, and he can talk 150 words per minute normally. But after training, he can talk 2.5 times faster, which is 150 * 2.5 = 375 words per minute.

To find out how many words he'll be talking in total, we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page: 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words.

Now, we need to find out how long it'll take him to talk 4500 words at 375 words per minute. We can do this by dividing the total number of words by his new speed: 4500 words / 375 words per minute = 12 minutes.

"Let's figure out how many people Conor saw at the beach that week.

Conor saw 50 people on the first day. The next day, 20 more people were at the beach, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the number of people doubled from the second day, so Conor saw 2 x 70 = 140 people.

We know that Conor saw 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people on the first three days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, we multiply 60 by 4 to get 60 x 4 = 240.

Now, we add the number of people Conor saw on the first three days to the number of people he saw on the remaining days: 260 + 240 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"Let's figure out how many pieces of popcorn Garrett has. 

First, we need to find out how many kernels popped in each 30-second interval. 

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 

Then, three times that amount popped in the next 30 seconds, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels. 

Next, four times the initial popping rate popped in the next 30 seconds, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels. 

Finally, in the last 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so it's 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200

But wait, we're not done yet. After Garrett took the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the last 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat. That's 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels.

So, we need to add those extra kernels to the total: 
200 + 10 = 210

The final answer is: 210"
"To make lemonade, Tim needs to know how many lemons to use. He wants to make 4 gallons for the party and 1 extra gallon for his friend Allen, but the extra gallon needs to be twice as tart. 

First, we need to find out how many cups of lemon juice Tim needs in total. Since each gallon of lemonade needs 1 cup of lemon juice, and he's making 5 gallons, we multiply the number of gallons by the number of cups per gallon.

5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups

Now, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for the extra tart lemonade. This lemonade needs twice as much lemon juice as the regular lemonade, so we multiply the number of cups by 2.

Extra tart lemonade cups = 1 gallon * 2 = 2 cups

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for the extra tart lemonade.

2 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 2/6 * 6 = 2 lemons

Now, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for the regular lemonade.

5 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 5/6 * 6 = 5 lemons

To find the total number of lemons needed, we add the lemons needed for the regular lemonade and the extra tart lemonade.

Total lemons needed = 2 lemons + 5 lemons = 7 lemons

"To find out how much dog food the Kennel house needs in a week, we need to know how much each type of dog eats and how many dogs there are.

German Shepherds eat 5 kilograms of food per day, and there are 3 of them. So, 3 German Shepherds eat 3 x 5 = 15 kilograms of food per day.

Bulldogs eat 3 kilograms of food per day, and there are 2 of them. So, 2 Bulldogs eat 2 x 3 = 6 kilograms of food per day.

Now, we add the food that the German Shepherds and Bulldogs eat together. 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms of food per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 21 kilograms by 7. 21 x 7 = 147 kilograms.

The Kennel house needs 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"Let's count the legs on the farm. We have 10 animals with 2 legs each and 15 animals with 4 legs each. 

First, we need to find out how many legs the 2-legged animals have. We can do this by multiplying the number of 2-legged animals by 2. 

10 animals * 2 legs per animal = 20 legs

Next, we need to find out how many legs the 4-legged animals have. We can do this by multiplying the number of 4-legged animals by 4.

15 animals * 4 legs per animal = 60 legs

Now, we need to add the number of legs from the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals to get the total number of legs.

20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since the question asks for pairs of animal legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2.

80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's figure out how many red blocks there are in the tower. We know there are 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks. So, there are 4 x 2 = 8 yellow blocks.

Now, we need to find out how many blocks are blue and yellow in total. We add the number of blue blocks and yellow blocks together: 4 + 8 = 12 blocks.

Since there are 32 blocks in the tower in total, we can find the number of red blocks by subtracting the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's figure out how far Elvis is from his house. 

First, we need to find out how far he traveled west and how far he traveled east. To do this, we multiply the speed by the time. Elvis's speed is 18 miles per hour, and he traveled for 5 hours west and 8 hours east.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance west = 18 miles/hour x 5 hours = 90 miles
Distance east = 18 miles/hour x 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east. This will tell us how far he is from his house now.

Distance west - Distance east = 90 miles - 144 miles = -54 miles

Since distance can't be negative, we need to find the absolute value of -54 miles. The absolute value of -54 miles is 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

First, we need to find 30% of $9000. To do this, we multiply $9000 by 0.3.

$9000 × 0.3 = $2700

So, the boat depreciated by $2700 in the first year. Now, we subtract this from the initial value to find the value after the first year.

$9000 - $2700 = $6300

Next, we need to find 30% of $6300.

$6300 × 0.3 = $1890

The boat depreciated by $1890 in the second year. Now, we subtract this from the value after the first year to find the value after the second year.

$6300 - $1890 = $4410

Now, we need to find 20% of $4410.

$4410 × 0.2 = $882

The boat depreciated by $882 in the third year. Now, we subtract this from the value after the second year to find the value after the third year.

$4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"Let's figure out how many pink Starbursts there are in the bag. We know there are 232 candies in total. We also know that there are 54 red candies. 

The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so it's 2 x 54 = 108.

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so it's 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

To find the number of pink candies, we need to subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

"Let's figure out how much Helen paid for her hotel and bus trips in Germany.

First, we need to find out how much she paid for the hotel. The hotel cost $80 per night, and she stayed for 3 nights. To find the total cost of the hotel, we multiply the cost of one night by the number of nights.

Cost of one night at the hotel: $80
Number of nights: 3
Total cost of the hotel: $80 × 3 = $240

Now, let's find out how much she paid for the bus trips. Each bus trip cost 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. To find 10% of $80, we multiply $80 by 0.1 (since 10% is the same as 0.1).

Cost of one night at the hotel: $80
Cost of one bus trip: 10% of $80 = 0.1 × $80 = $8
Number of bus trips: 7
Total cost of the bus trips: $8 × 7 = $56

To find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels, we add the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips.

Total cost of the hotel: $240
Total cost of the bus trips: $56
Total cost of the hotel and bus travels: $240 + $56 = $296

First, we need to find out how many marbles Dallas got. We know that he had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we need to add those 4 marbles back to find out how many he had at first. 

25 marbles = 21 marbles (he had after dropping some) + 4 marbles (he dropped)

So, Dallas had 25 marbles at first.

Now, we know that Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins. Since Dallas had 25 marbles, we can find out how many marbles Darla got by subtracting 25 from 52.

52 - 25 = 27

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla."

$24 + $8 = $32

Next, we need to find the cost of the popcorns. They bought 2 popcorns for $3 each. So, the total cost of the popcorns is 2 * $3.

2 * $3 = $6

Now, let's add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns together: $32 + $6 = $38.

The final answer is: $38"
"To find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, we need to add their individual weights together.

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Now, we need to find 1% of the total weight, which is the force needed to move the car. To do this, we multiply the total weight by 0.01 (since 1% is the same as 0.01).

Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

So, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."
"To find out how much crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the backyard fence. The perimeter is the distance around the fence. To find it, we add up the lengths of all four sides.

The backyard fence is a rectangle, so we need to add the lengths of the two long sides and the two short sides. The long side is 20 feet, and the short side is 15 feet.

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper."
"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we need to know their ages. We know that Mia is 40 years old and she is younger than Emma. Since they are 16 years apart in age, we can find Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age. So, Emma's age is 40 + 16 = 56 years old.

Now, we need to find the average of their ages. To do this, we add their ages together and divide by 2. The sum of their ages is 40 + 56 = 96. To find the average, we divide 96 by 2.

Seven dimes are worth 7 x 10 = 70 cents. We multiply the number of dimes by the value of one dime.

Now, let's add the values together: 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents.

So, James has a total of 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to find the age of the older brother and then add the ages of all the siblings.

Since one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother, we can find the older brother's age by multiplying 12 by 2. 

12 * 2 = 24

The older brother is 24 years old.

Now, we know that all the sisters are the same age, which is 16. So, we can find the total age of the 3 sisters by multiplying 16 by 3.

16 * 3 = 48

The total age of the 3 sisters is 48 years.

The total age of the 2 brothers is 12 + 24 = 36 years.

To find the total age of all the siblings, we add the total age of the brothers and the total age of the sisters.

48 + 36 = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how much time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga, we need to add up the time she spends on each activity.

Charisma meditates twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. She meditates for 15 minutes each time. So, she meditates for 15 + 15 = 30 minutes each day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily meditation time by 7 to get the total time spent on meditation per week: 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week.

Charisma also practices yoga for 1 hour, or 60 minutes, 5 days a week. To find the total time spent on yoga per week, we multiply the daily yoga time by 5: 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.

Now, we add the time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 210 minutes/week (meditation) + 300 minutes/week (yoga) = 510 minutes/week.

To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: 2040"
"To find the total square feet of fabric used for the quilt, we need to calculate the total square feet from each type of shirt and add them together.

First, let's find the total square feet from the small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet

Next, we'll find the total square feet from the medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet

Lastly, we'll find the total square feet from the large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Now, we add the total square feet from each type of shirt: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101

The final answer is: 101"
"To find the total number of seeds, we need to know how many seeds are in a small sunflower and a large sunflower. 

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is 12, we multiply 3 by 12 to find the total number of seeds in a small sunflower: 3 × 12 = 36.

Now, we need to find the number of seeds in a large sunflower. It has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. Then, we add this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds in a large sunflower.

Now, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower to find the total number of seeds: 36 + 54 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's figure out how many pens Sarah has. We know that George has 18 pens. Since Timothy has three times as many pens as George, we multiply 18 by 3 to find out how many pens Timothy has. 

18 × 3 = 54

So, Timothy has 54 pens. Now, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. We know that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. To find half of 54, we divide 54 by 2.

54 ÷ 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's figure out how tall Jackie was before summer.

We know Albert is 36"" tall, and Anne is twice as tall as Albert. To find Anne's height, we multiply Albert's height by 2: 2 x 36 = 72"".

Now, we know Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne. So, we subtract 2 from Anne's height to find Jackie's height: 72 - 2 = 70"".

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we need to subtract 3 from her current height to find her height before summer: 70 - 3 = 67"".

So, Jackie was 67"" tall before summer.

The final answer is: 67"
"To find out how much money the company gets from selling chocolate bars, we need to know how many bars they make and how much each bar costs.

The company makes 5000 bars in one day. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, they make 5000 * 7 = 35000 bars.

Since we want to know how much money they get in two weeks, we multiply the number of bars they make in one week by 2. So, 35000 * 2 = 70000 bars.

Each bar costs $2. To find the total money they get, we multiply the number of bars by the price per bar: 70000 * 2 = $140000.

The final answer is: $140000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, we multiply the price by 2: 2 x $8 = $16. But, there's a deal where if you buy one T-shirt, you get another one for 50% off. So, we need to find the cost of one T-shirt at the original price and the other one at 50% off. The first T-shirt costs $8, and the second one costs $8 x 0.5 = $4. Now, we add the two prices together: $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, we need to find the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by 0.4: $40 x 0.4 = $16. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes together: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"Let's figure out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy.

Ryan gets $6 each week he does his chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks, so he gets 6 x 3 = $18.

He spent $5 on ice cream cones for himself and his friends. Now, let's subtract that from his total money: $18 - $5 = $13.

Now, we need to find out how many movie tickets he can buy. Each ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we need to divide his remaining money by the cost of a ticket: $13 ÷ $6.50 = 2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani, we need to add up the costs of all the items they bought.

Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. To find the total amount she spent, we add these two numbers together: $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes for $100 each. We need to multiply the cost of the bathrobes by 2 to find the total cost of the bathrobes: $100 x 2 = $200. Then, we add the cost of the sunglasses to this amount: $30 + $200 = $230.

Now, we need to find the total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani. We add the amount Ellen spent to the amount Lani spent: $105 + $230 = $335.

The final answer is: $335"
"To find out how much profit Tim makes selling his honey and jam mix, we need to know how much it costs to make one jar and how much he sells it for.

First, let's find the cost of making one jar. We need 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of honey. 

The cost of passion fruit is $6 per pound, so 2 pounds cost 2 x $6 = $12.
The cost of jackfruit is $8 per pound, so 1.5 pounds cost 1.5 x $8 = $12.
The cost of honey is $10 per pound, so 2 pounds cost 2 x $10 = $20.

Now, let's add up the costs: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44. This is the cost of making one jar.

Tim sells each jar for $50. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the selling price: $50 - $44 = $6.

If Tim sells 10 jars, his total profit will be 10 x $6 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's count the money in the jar. We have quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. 

First, let's count the quarters. We have 32 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25. So, we multiply 32 by $0.25 to get the total value of the quarters.

32 x $0.25 = $8

Next, let's count the dimes. We have 95 dimes. Each dime is worth $0.10. So, we multiply 95 by $0.10 to get the total value of the dimes.

95 x $0.10 = $9.50

Now, let's count the nickels. We have 120 nickels. Each nickel is worth $0.05. So, we multiply 120 by $0.05 to get the total value of the nickels.

120 x $0.05 = $6

Finally, let's count the pennies. We have 750 pennies. Each penny is worth $0.01. So, we multiply 750 by $0.01 to get the total value of the pennies.

750 x $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add up the values of all the coins.

$8 + $9.50 = $17.50
$17.50 + $6 = $23.50
$23.50 + $7.50 = $31

The total amount of money in the jar is $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"Let's figure out how much money Janet has left after her trip to the mall.

First, we need to add up how much she spent. She spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 for a movie ticket for herself, and another $7.50 for a movie ticket for her sister. That's a total of $3.50 + $7.50 + $7.50 = $18.50 for the movie tickets. Then, she spent $8.50 on a bracelet. So, the total amount she spent is $18.50 + $8.50 = $27.

Now, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from the $40 her parents gave her. $40 - $27 = $13.

The final answer is: $13"
"Josh runs a car shop and services 3 cars a day. He is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday. He gets paid $4 per car. Let's figure out how much he makes in 2 weeks.

First, we need to know how many days Josh is open in a week. He is open 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday) and not open 2 days a week (Sunday and Wednesday). So, he is open 5 days a week.

In 1 week, Josh is open 5 days, so he services 5 * 3 = 15 cars.

In 2 weeks, Josh is open 10 days, so he services 10 * 3 = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so in 2 weeks, he makes 30 * $4 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's figure out how many cookies Randy has now.

Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. That's a total of 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies.

Randy eats 3 cookies for a snack, one of each flavor. So, he eats 3 cookies in total.

Then, he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch.

After that, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends.

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. That's 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 cookies.

Now, let's count the cookies he doesn't have anymore: 3 (snack) + 2 (lunch) + 2 (given away) = 7 cookies.

To find out how many cookies Randy has now, we need to subtract the cookies he doesn't have anymore from the total number of cookies he started with, and then add the cookies he baked.

Total cookies now = Total cookies initially - Cookies he doesn't have anymore + Cookies he baked
Total cookies now = 18 - 7 + 12
Total cookies now = 23

"Let's figure out how much money Matthew would get if he sells his toy soldiers.

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. He wants to sell them to someone who will pay him half the price for half the soldiers and a different price for the other half. The buyer will pay $5 for the first 6 soldiers and $7 for the other 6 soldiers.

To find the total amount Matthew will get, we need to add the money he gets from the first half and the second half.

For the first 6 soldiers, he gets 6 x $5 = $30.

For the other 6 soldiers, he gets 6 x $7 = $42.

Now, we add the two amounts together: $30 + $42 = $72.

So, Matthew will get a total of $72 if he sells his toy soldiers."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many holes the dog dug while Nate was on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day, and Nate was on vacation for 14 days.

6 holes/day × 14 days = 84 holes

Now, we need to add the holes the dog dug at night. Since the dog digs 6 holes every night, and Nate was on vacation for 14 days, the dog dug 6 holes/night × 14 nights = 84 holes at night.

So, the total number of holes is 84 + 84 = 168 holes.

Next, we need to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3.

Now, we can divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day to find the number of days it takes to fill the holes.

168 holes ÷ 3 holes/day = 56 days

Since we need to find the number of weeks, we'll divide the total days by 7.

56 days ÷ 7 days/week = 8 weeks

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to know how many students go to each school. Norman High School has 4000 students. Butler High School has 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. 

To find 3/4 of 4000, we multiply 4000 by 3 and then divide by 4. 

4000 * 3 = 12000
12000 / 4 = 3000

So, Butler High School has 3000 students. To find the difference in enrollment, we subtract the number of students at Butler High School from the number of students at Norman High School.

4000 - 3000 = 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Let's start by writing down what we know:

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Now, let's subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

So, the Adams family made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's figure out how many beakers Igor lost. 

Igor was supposed to get 16 test tubes, but he only got half of that, which is 8 test tubes. He was also supposed to get 14 Petri dishes, but he got 2 more than that, which is 16 - 2 = 14. But wait, we already know he got 12 Petri dishes, so that's correct. 

Igor got the right number of beakers, which is 7. Let's add up the items he got: 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 12 Petri dishes = 27 items.

Since Igor had 29 items on the lab bench, he must have lost 29 - 27 = 2 beakers.

The answer is 2."
"Let's figure out how many screws James will have left over.

First, we need to find out how many screws are needed for the tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, we multiply the number of legs by the number of screws per leg: 4 legs x 2 screws/leg = 8 screws per table.

Since James is making 4 tables, we multiply the number of screws per table by the number of tables: 8 screws/table x 4 tables = 32 screws.

Now, we need to subtract the number of screws used from the total number of screws James has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

So, James will have 8 screws left over.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's count the eggs. We have 10 eggs in one basket. The other basket has twice as many eggs as the first one. To find out how many eggs are in the second basket, we multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to add up the money each girl raised.

Alexandra raised $430. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so she raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Sarah raised $300. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so she raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add the amounts raised by each girl: $750 + $430 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's figure out how long it took Vanessa to run her part of the race.

We know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa. This means if Aaron runs a mile in a certain amount of time, Vanessa will run a mile in twice that amount of time.

We also know that Aaron ran his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, she must have run 2 miles. 

If Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can find out how long it takes him to run 1 mile by dividing 16 minutes by 2. This is because 2 miles is twice as far as 1 mile.

16 minutes ÷ 2 = 8 minutes

So, it takes Aaron 8 minutes to run 1 mile. Since Vanessa runs twice as slow as Aaron, it will take her twice as long to run 1 mile. 

8 minutes × 2 = 16 minutes

Therefore, it takes Vanessa 16 minutes to run 1 mile. Since she ran 2 miles, it will take her 2 times as long to run 2 miles.

16 minutes × 2 = 32 minutes

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we need to know how much line he needs for the dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet (dock) * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

He already has 6 feet of line, so we need to subtract that from the total amount needed:

600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"Let's figure out how much money Tom's restaurant makes in a week.

First, we need to know how much money they make in one day. They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation orders 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. So, let's add up the cost of the meals and the wine:

2 meals * $5 = 2 x 5 = $10
$10 + $5 = $15

So, they make $15 in one day. Now, we need to know how many days they are open in a week. They are open 2 days a week.

To find out how much they make in a week, we multiply the amount they make in one day by the number of days they are open:

$15 * 2 = $30

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to know how much money the vendor made in total and how much he made per watermelon.

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. This means the cost of 1 watermelon is $80 ÷ 50 = $1.60.

The vendor sold the watermelons at a 25% profit. This means he sold them for 125% of the cost price (100% of the cost price + 25% profit).

Let's find the total amount of money the vendor made from selling the watermelons. We know that the selling price is 125% of the cost price, which is $80. So, the selling price is (125/100) × $80 = $100.

Now, we know the total amount of money the vendor made from selling the watermelons is $100. To find out how much he made per watermelon, we divide the total amount by the number of watermelons: $100 ÷ 50 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find James' current age. We know that James is twice as old as his sister Dora, and Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. This means Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

Now, we need to find out how old James is now compared to when he was born. We know that John had James when he was 19, but this information seems a bit weird because it says John had James when he was 19, not that James was born when John was 19. Let's just ignore this part and focus on the rest of the problem.

We are also told that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. This means John's youngest son is currently 32 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 32 + 3 = 35 years old.

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's figure out how many more oranges Ana will peel than Jane after an hour.

We know that Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. To find out how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour, we need to divide 60 minutes by the time it takes them to peel one orange.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 ÷ 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 ÷ 4 = 15 oranges.

Now, let's find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane. We subtract the number of oranges Jane peels from the number of oranges Ana peels: 20 - 15 = 5.

So, Ana will peel 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

The final answer is: 5"
"So Mark's car broke down and he needs a new radiator. He goes to a junk shop and gets it for 80% off. That means he pays 20% of the original price. The original price is $400. To find 20% of 400, I multiply 400 by 0.2. That's 400 x 0.2 = $80.

Now, Mark needs to pay a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour. To find the total labor cost, I multiply 3 hours by $50. That's 3 x $50 = $150.

To find the total cost, I add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost. That's $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, and they are either chickens or cows. We also know that the total number of legs is 70.

Let's say the number of chickens is C and the number of cows is W. We can write two equations:

1. C + W = 20 (since there are 20 animals in total)
2. 2C + 4W = 70 (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can solve the first equation for W: W = 20 - C.

Now, substitute this expression for W into the second equation: 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.

The final answer is: 5"
