"To determine Janet's daily earnings from selling eggs at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she has available for sale after accounting for her personal consumption and baking.

Let's denote the number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks as E = 16. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for muffins, resulting in a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs used.

The number of eggs available for sale can be calculated as E - 7 = 16 - 7 = 9.

Janet sells the remaining eggs at $2 per egg. Therefore, her daily earnings from selling eggs at the farmers' market can be calculated as 9 \* 2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to consider the amount of blue and white fiber needed. The problem states that the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber. 

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Let B = blue fiber bolts
W = white fiber bolts

Given that B = 2, we can express the amount of white fiber as W = B/2 = 2/2 = 1.

To find the total number of bolts, we add the blue and white fiber bolts together:

Total bolts = B + W = 2 + 1 = 3

Therefore, the total number of bolts required for the robe is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the profit made by Josh, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The original value of the house was $80,000, and Josh invested $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

New Value = Original Value + (Original Value * 1.5)

Substituting the given values, we get:

New Value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New Value = $80,000 + $120,000
New Value = $200,000

The total cost of the house is the sum of the original price and the repairs:

Total Cost = Original Price + Repairs
Total Cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total Cost = $130,000

Now, we can calculate the profit as the difference between the new value and the total cost:

Profit = New Value - Total Cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

Therefore, the profit made by Josh is $70,000.

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To determine the total distance James covers in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he covers in a single sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Given that James runs 3 sprints in a session, with each sprint being 60 meters, the total distance covered in a session can be calculated as follows:

Total distance/session = 3 sprints/session × 60 meters/sprint
= 3 × 60
= 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total distance he covers in a week is:

Total distance/week = Total distance/session × Number of sessions/week
= 180 meters/session × 3 sessions/week
= 540 meters/week

Therefore, James covers a total distance of 540 meters in a week.

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we must first calculate the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon. 

Let's denote the number of cups of feed given in the morning as $M$ and the number of cups of feed given in the afternoon as $A$. We are given that $M = 15$ and $A = 25$. The total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon is $M + A = 15 + 25 = 40$ cups.

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is $3 \times 20 = 60$ cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: $60 - 40 = 20$ cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total cost of the glasses, we can use a geometric series formula. The cost of the first glass is $5, and the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous one. This forms a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 0.6.

The total cost can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = $5, r = 0.6, and n = 16.

S = $5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6)

S = $5 * (1 - 0.00006103515625) / 0.4

S = $5 * 0.99993896484375 / 0.4

S = $5 * 2.49964246171875

S ≈ $12.49712130859

However, this is not the total cost, as we need to add the cost of the first glass. The total cost is the sum of the first glass and the sum of the remaining 15 glasses.

Total cost = $5 + S

Total cost ≈ $5 + $12.49712130859

Total cost ≈ $17.49712130859

Rounded to two decimal places, the total cost is approximately $17.50.

The final answer is: $17.50"
"Given the problem, we can establish a linear relationship between the number of sheep in each city. Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as S, Charleston as C, and Toulouse as T. We are given that:

1. T = 2C (Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston)
2. C = 4S (Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle)
3. S = 20 (Seattle has 20 sheep)

Substituting the value of S into the equation C = 4S, we get:
C = 4(20) = 80

Now, substituting the value of C into the equation T = 2C, we get:
T = 2(80) = 160

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
T + C + S = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To determine the total time it takes to download the file, we can break down the process into three distinct phases: the initial download, the update installation, and the resumed download.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. Given that Carla can download 2 GB/minute, we can use the formula:

Time = (Fraction of File Downloaded) × (Total File Size) / Download Rate

For the first 40% of the file:
Time = (0.4) × (200 GB) / (2 GB/minute) = 40 minutes

Next, we need to account for the time it takes to install the updates, which is given as 20 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
Time = (Fraction of File Downloaded) × (Total File Size) / Download Rate
Time = (0.6) × (200 GB) / (2 GB/minute) = 60 minutes

To find the total time, we add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
Total Time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in each segment of his trip and then subtract the total distance from the initial distance.

Let's break down the problem into three segments:

1. Distance traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:
The distance traveled in this segment can be calculated using the formula:
\[ d = v \times t \]
where $d$ is the distance, $v$ is the speed, and $t$ is the time. Substituting the given values, we get:
\[ d_1 = 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ miles} \]

2. Distance traveled in the first 2 hours of the return trip in standstill traffic:
Since John is not moving during this time, the distance traveled is 0 miles.

3. Distance traveled in the next half-hour at 30 mph:
Using the same formula as before, we get:
\[ d_2 = 30 \times 0.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

4. Distance traveled in the remaining 2 hours of the return trip at 80 mph:
Again, using the same formula, we get:
\[ d_3 = 80 \times 2 = 160 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance traveled in the return trip is the sum of $d_2$ and $d_3$:
\[ d_{\text{return}} = d_2 + d_3 = 15 + 160 = 175 \text{ miles} \]

The initial distance from home is the distance traveled in the first 3 hours, which is 180 miles. To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to subtract the total distance traveled from the initial distance:
\[ d_{\text{from home}} = d_1 - d_{\text{return}} = 180 - 175 = 5 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours is 5 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours separately.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the regular hours. Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10, and she worked 40 hours. Therefore, her earnings for the regular hours are given by the product of her hourly rate and the number of regular hours worked:

$$
\text{Regular Earnings} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Number of Regular Hours} = 10 \times 40 = 400
$$

Next, we need to calculate her earnings for the overtime hours. Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so the number of overtime hours is given by the difference between the total hours worked and the number of regular hours:

$$
\text{Overtime Hours} = \text{Total Hours} - \text{Regular Hours} = 45 - 40 = 5
$$

Eliza's overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is $10. Therefore, her overtime pay rate is:

$$
\text{Overtime Pay Rate} = 1.2 \times \text{Hourly Rate} = 1.2 \times 10 = 12
$$

Now, we can calculate her earnings for the overtime hours by multiplying the overtime pay rate by the number of overtime hours:

$$
\text{Overtime Earnings} = \text{Overtime Pay Rate} \times \text{Overtime Hours} = 12 \times 5 = 60
$$

Finally, we can find Eliza's total earnings for the week by adding her regular earnings and overtime earnings:

$$
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Regular Earnings} + \text{Overtime Earnings} = 400 + 60 = 460
$$

The final answer is: $460"
"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we note that the program had 60 downloads in the first month. 

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, which can be expressed as 3 \* 60 = 180 downloads.

Next, we need to calculate the number of downloads in the third month, which is a 30% reduction from the second month. To do this, we can find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. This can be expressed as 0.3 \* 180 = 54. Subtracting this from 180 gives us 180 - 54 = 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we can find the total number of downloads by adding the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: $\boxed{366}$"
"To determine the total cost of the pastries Toula purchased, we must first calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum these values.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is given by the product of the number of dozens and the cost per dozen: 3 × $68 = $204.

Similarly, the cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 × $80 = $160.

Lastly, the cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 × $55 = $330.

To find the total cost, we add the individual costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

Therefore, the total cost of the pastries Toula purchased is $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To determine the break-even point for the lemon tree, we need to calculate the time it takes for the cumulative revenue to exceed the initial cost. The initial cost of the tree is $90, and the annual revenue is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50. The annual maintenance cost is $3.

The net revenue per year is $10.50 - $3 = $7.50. To find the break-even point, we can use the formula:

Break-even point = Initial cost / Net revenue per year

Break-even point = $90 / $7.50
Break-even point = 12 years

However, this calculation assumes that the tree starts generating revenue in the first year. Since the tree will start producing lemons and generating revenue in the first year, we can conclude that it will take 12 years for the tree to pay for itself and start earning a profit.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as x.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which can be expressed as $\frac{x}{3}$. Therefore, the remaining number of vacuum cleaners after the green house sale is $x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}$.

Subsequently, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with $\frac{2x}{3} - 2$ vacuum cleaners.

Next, she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners at the orange house. This can be represented as $\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2x}{3} - 2\right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1$.

We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

$$\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5$$

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation:

$$\frac{x}{3} = 6$$

Multiplying both sides by 3 yields:

$$x = 18$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can apply a stepwise approach. 

First, we calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 20% of the total number of students:
\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find the number of remaining students, which is the total number of students minus the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Then, we calculate the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25% of the remaining students:
\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we can determine the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students:
\[ 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the optimal investment choice, we need to calculate the expected increase in value for each option. 

Let's denote the initial price of the jewelry as $5,000 and the initial price of the electronic gadgets as $8,000. The expected increase in value for each item can be calculated as follows:

- Jewelry: 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
- Electronic gadgets: 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Since the jewelry is expected to increase in value by $125, which is greater than the $96 increase for the electronic gadgets, the optimal choice for the merchant is to invest in the jewelry.

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125.

The final answer is: $125"
"Given the scenario, we have two trains traveling in a two-dimensional plane, with their paths forming a right-angled triangle. The westward journey of 80 miles and the northward journey of 150 miles can be treated as the legs of a right-angled triangle.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b):

c² = a² + b²

where a = 80 miles (westward journey) and b = 150 miles (northward journey).

c² = 80² + 150²
c² = 6400 + 22500
c² = 28900

Taking the square root of both sides:

c = √28900
c ≈ 170.06 miles

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is approximately 170.06 miles."
"To determine Jill's annual salary, we must first calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately, and then sum these values to obtain her total annual compensation.

Let's begin by calculating her earnings from teaching. We know that Jill is paid $20 per hour and works 35 hours per week. Given that she works 50 weeks per year, we can calculate her total hours worked annually as follows:

Total hours worked per year = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year

Now, we can calculate her annual earnings from teaching by multiplying her hourly wage by the total hours worked per year:

Annual earnings from teaching = $20/hour * 1750 hours/year = $35,000/year

Next, we'll calculate her earnings from coaching. Jill is paid $30 per hour and works 15 hours per week. Given that she works 50 weeks per year, we can calculate her total hours worked annually as follows:

Total hours worked per year = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year

Now, we can calculate her annual earnings from coaching by multiplying her hourly wage by the total hours worked per year:

Annual earnings from coaching = $30/hour * 750 hours/year = $22,500/year

To find Jill's total annual salary, we sum her earnings from teaching and coaching:

Total annual salary = Annual earnings from teaching + Annual earnings from coaching
= $35,000/year + $22,500/year
= $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we must first calculate the total number of eggs she will eat during this period. Given that she prepares a 3-egg omelet every morning, we can calculate the total number of eggs consumed as follows:

Let's denote the number of days in 4 weeks as $n$. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can express $n$ as $n = 4 \times 7 = 28$ days.

The total number of eggs consumed in 28 days can be calculated by multiplying the number of eggs per day (3) by the number of days (28):

$$\text{Total eggs} = 3 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 28 \, \text{days} = 84 \, \text{eggs}$$

To find the number of dozens of eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen:

$$\text{Dozens of eggs} = \frac{84 \, \text{eggs}}{12 \, \text{eggs/dozen}} = 7 \, \text{dozens}$$

Therefore, Claire will consume 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the speed at which Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we can utilize the concept of average speed and the formula for calculating it. The average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

Given that Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike, we can calculate the total time required to complete the hike as follows:

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time

Substituting the values, we get:

Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we first need to calculate the amount of water in the initial 10 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is $\frac{2}{3} \cdot 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67$ liters.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is $\frac{3}{5} \cdot 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9$ liters.

The total amount of water in the initial mixture is the sum of the water in the orange and pineapple drinks, which is $6.67 + 9 = 15.67$ liters.

When 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the amount of water lost is $\frac{2}{3} \cdot 1 = \frac{2}{3}$ liters, since the orange drink is two-thirds water.

The remaining amount of water in the mixture is $15.67 - \frac{2}{3} = 15.67 - 0.67 = 15$ liters.

However, we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. To do this, we need to find the amount of water in the 9 liters of non-water liquid in the orange and pineapple drinks.

The amount of non-water liquid in the orange drink is $10 - 6.67 = 3.33$ liters, and the amount of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is $15 - 9 = 6$ liters.

The amount of water in the 3.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 3.33 = 1.11$ liters, and the amount of water in the 6 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is $\frac{2}{5} \cdot 6 = 2.4$ liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is $15 + 1.11 + 2.4 = 18.51$ liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18.51}$"
"Given that Raymond and Samantha are cousins, and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can establish a temporal relationship between their ages. Samantha's current age is 31, which implies that Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Since Raymond had a son at the age of 23, we can calculate the number of years that have elapsed since the son's birth by subtracting the age at which the son was born from Raymond's current age: 25 - 23 = 2.

This calculation indicates that Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday, we can break down the sales into distinct groups based on the number of DVDs purchased by each group of customers.

The first 3 customers each purchased 1 DVD, resulting in a total of 3 DVDs sold to this group. This can be represented as:

3 \* 1 = 3 DVDs

The next 2 customers each purchased 2 DVDs, resulting in a total of 4 DVDs sold to this group. This can be represented as:

2 \* 2 = 4 DVDs

To find the total number of DVDs sold, we can add the number of DVDs sold to each group:

3 + 4 = 7 DVDs

Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday is 7."
"To determine the total reduction in the candle's length, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. 

The rate at which the candle melts is 2 centimeters per hour. This can be represented as a linear function, where the change in length (ΔL) is directly proportional to the time (t) elapsed:

ΔL = kt

where k is the rate of melting (2 cm/hour) and t is the time (4 hours).

ΔL = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
ΔL = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To determine the original price of the book, we can utilize the concept of percentage decrease. Given that the discounted price is $19.50 and it represents a 25% discount from the original price, we can express this relationship as an equation.

Let x be the original price of the book. The discount amount is 25% of the original price, which can be represented as 0.25x. Therefore, the discounted price is the original price minus the discount, or x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. Thus, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x &= \frac{19.50}{0.75} \\
x &= 26
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of pizza boxes as x.

The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + 5 \times 3 + 4 \times 1.50 = 12 + 15 + 6 = 33$ dollars.

The total cost of the pizza boxes can be represented as $8.50x$, where x is the number of boxes.

We know that the total amount Marie paid is $50, so we can set up the equation:

$12 + 15 + 6 + 8.50x = 50$

Combining like terms, we get:

$33 + 8.50x = 50$

Subtracting 33 from both sides of the equation yields:

$8.50x = 17$

Dividing both sides by 8.50, we find:

$x = \frac{17}{8.50}$

$x = 2$

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on the clothing items, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. Specifically, we will utilize the distributive property of multiplication to calculate the cost of each item and then sum the results.

Let's denote the cost of one pair of shorts as $16.50, the cost of one pair of pants as $22.50, and the cost of one pair of shoes as $42. We are given that Mishka purchased 3 pairs of each item.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts can be calculated as follows:

3 \* $16.50 = $49.50

The cost of 3 pairs of pants can be calculated as follows:

3 \* $22.50 = $67.50

The cost of 3 pairs of shoes can be calculated as follows:

3 \* $42 = $126

Now, we can sum the costs of the individual items to determine the total amount spent:

$49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of $243 on the clothing items.

The final answer is: $243"
"To determine the total expenditure on ice cream, we must first calculate the number of cartons Cynthia requires over a 60-day period. Given that she consumes one serving per night, the total number of servings needed is equivalent to the number of days, which is 60.

Since each carton contains 15 servings, we can calculate the total number of cartons required as follows:

$$\text{Number of cartons} = \frac{\text{Total servings}}{\text{Servings per carton}} = \frac{60}{15} = 4$$

Now, we can determine the total expenditure by multiplying the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

$$\text{Total expenditure} = \text{Number of cartons} \times \text{Cost per carton} = 4 \times \$4.00 = \$16.00$$

Therefore, Cynthia's total expenditure on ice cream over a 60-day period is $16.00.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To determine the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we can utilize a simple geometric approach. Given that Henry's first stop was after 20 miles and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, we can visualize this scenario as a line segment with two points of interest.

Let's denote the starting point of the trip as point A, the first stop as point B (20 miles from A), and the second stop as point C (15 miles before the end of the trip). The total distance of the trip is 60 miles, so the distance from point C to the end of the trip (point D) is 45 miles.

We can calculate the distance between points B and C by subtracting the distance from point C to point D from the distance from point A to point B.

Distance from A to B = 20 miles
Distance from C to D = 45 miles

Distance from B to C = Distance from A to B - Distance from C to D
Distance from B to C = 20 - 45
Distance from B to C = -25 miles

However, the negative sign indicates that we are calculating the distance in the opposite direction. To find the actual distance between points B and C, we can take the absolute value of the result.

|Distance from B to C| = |-25|
|Distance from B to C| = 25 miles

Therefore, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a linear equation to represent the given information. Let's denote the cost of the boots as B and the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as H. We are given that the cost of the less expensive pair of heels is $33, and the more expensive pair costs twice as much, which is 2 * 33 = $66.

We are also given that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. This can be represented by the equation B = 33 + 66 - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

Therefore, the cost of the boots is $94.

The final answer is: $94"
"Given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11, we can express their ages as 7x and 11x, respectively, where x is a constant representing the common multiplier. The total of their ages is 162, which can be represented by the equation 7x + 11x = 162.

Combining like terms, we obtain 18x = 162. To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 18, yielding x = 162 / 18 = 9.

Now that we have determined the value of x, we can calculate Allen's current age by substituting x into the expression 11x, resulting in 11 * 9 = 99.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age, giving us 99 + 10 = 109.

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To determine the average guess of Gunter's friends, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide by the number of people.

Let's denote the first person's guess as $x = 80$. The second person's guess is 20 more than half of the first one, which can be expressed as $\frac{x}{2} + 20$. The third person's guess is 25% more than the first one, which can be calculated as $x + 0.25x = 1.25x$.

Now, we can calculate the total number of guesses by adding the individual guesses: $x + \left(\frac{x}{2} + 20\right) + 1.25x$. Simplifying this expression, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x + \left(\frac{x}{2} + 20\right) + 1.25x &= x + \frac{x}{2} + 20 + 1.25x \\
&= 2.5x + 20
\end{aligned}
$$

Substituting $x = 80$ into the expression, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2.5(80) + 20 &= 200 + 20 \\
&= 220
\end{aligned}
$$

There are 3 people, so the average guess is the total number of guesses divided by 3:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{220}{3} &= 73.\overline{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{73.33}$"
"To determine the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we can apply the concept of time management and mathematical operations. 

First, we need to calculate the total time spent on dog care per day. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog.

Let's denote the number of dogs as $n$ and the time spent on each dog as $t$. In this scenario, $n = 10$ and $t = 0.5$ hours.

Total time per day = $n \cdot t$
Total time per day = $10 \cdot 0.5$
Total time per day = $5$ hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total time spent on dog care in a week by multiplying the total time per day by 7.

Total time per week = Total time per day $\cdot 7$
Total time per week = $5 \cdot 7$
Total time per week = $35$ hours

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of dogs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"Given that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, with 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can establish a linear equation to represent this relationship. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. The given information can be expressed as:

G = S + 30  ... (Equation 1)

We also know that the total number of coins is 110, which can be represented as:

S + G = 110  ... (Equation 2)

To solve for the number of gold coins, we can substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:

S + (S + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2S + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2S = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 40

Now that we have found the number of silver coins, we can substitute S into Equation 1 to find the number of gold coins:

G = 40 + 30
G = 70

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"Given the problem, we can establish a series of equations to determine the number of jewels Siobhan possesses.

Let's denote the number of jewels Raymond has as R, the number of jewels Aaron has as A, and the number of jewels Siobhan has as S.

We are given the following information:

1. R = 40 (Raymond has 40 jewels)
2. A = (1/2)R + 5 (Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels)
3. S = A - 2 (Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron)

Substituting the value of R into equation (2), we get:
A = (1/2)(40) + 5
A = 20 + 5
A = 25

Now, substituting the value of A into equation (3), we get:
S = 25 - 2
S = 23

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"To determine the total points scored by Mike in the ping pong game, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

Let's denote the points scored in the first 20 minutes as P1. We are given that P1 = 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. This can be expressed as P2 = P1 + 0.25P1. Substituting the value of P1, we get P2 = 4 + 0.25(4) = 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: Total points = P1 + P2 = 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total expenditure on yogurt over a 30-day period, we first need to calculate the number of yogurt sets Terry purchases. Given that he consumes 2 yogurts per day, the total number of yogurts consumed in 30 days is 2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts.

Since the yogurts are sold in sets of 4 for $5.00, we can calculate the number of sets by dividing the total number of yogurts by the number of yogurts per set: 60 yogurts / 4 yogurts/set = 15 sets.

Now, we can determine the total expenditure by multiplying the number of sets by the cost per set: 15 sets * $5.00/set = $75.00.

Therefore, the total expenditure on yogurt over 30 days is $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To determine the number of Lego sets John still has, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from selling the Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money.

Let's denote the number of Lego sets John sold as $n$. The total revenue from selling the Lego sets is given by the product of the number of sets sold and the price per set, which is $15n$. However, we know that John used some of his own money to buy the video games, so the total revenue from the Lego sales is $15n - 35$.

We also know that John bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is $8 \times 20 = 160$ dollars. Additionally, he had $5 left after buying the video games.

The total amount of money John made from selling the Lego sets is equal to the cost of the video games plus the remaining money, which is $160 + 5 = 165$ dollars. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

$$15n - 35 = 165$$

Solving for $n$, we get:

$$15n = 165 + 35$$
$$15n = 200$$
$$n = \frac{200}{15}$$
$$n = \frac{40}{3}$$

Since John cannot sell a fraction of a Lego set, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, we know that John sold 13 Lego sets in total. So, he must have sold $\frac{40}{3}$ sets with his own money and the remaining 13 - $\frac{40}{3}$ sets with the money from the Lego sales.

To find the number of Lego sets John still has, we can calculate the number of sets he sold with his own money and subtract it from the total number of sets:

$$\text{Number of sets John still has} = 13 - \frac{40}{3}$$

Since we cannot have a fraction of a Lego set, we can approximate the value of $\frac{40}{3}$ to 13.33. However, we know that John sold 13 Lego sets in total. So, he must have sold 2 Lego sets with his own money and the remaining 13 - 2 = 11 sets with the money from the Lego sales.

Therefore, John still has 11 Lego sets left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

Let's denote the total running time as $T$. John runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days, which is $1.5$ hours each. Therefore, the total running time can be expressed as:

$$T = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours}$$

Since John runs 3 days a week, we need to multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time:

$$T_{\text{weekly}} = 6 \text{ hours} \times 3 = 18 \text{ hours}$$

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

$$\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{18 \text{ hours}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ miles per hour}$$

Therefore, John's running speed is $\frac{10}{3}$ miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"To solve this problem, we can apply the concept of relative motion and time allocation to determine the total distance traveled by Dana. Given that Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour, which is half of her running speed, we can deduce that her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can calculate her walking speed as 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's consider the time allocation for walking and running. Dana spends two-thirds of the time walking and one-third of the time running. Therefore, the time spent walking is 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours, and the time spent running is 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours.

The distance traveled while walking is given by the product of the walking speed and the time spent walking, which is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles. Similarly, the distance traveled while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The total distance traveled in six hours is the sum of the distances traveled while walking and running, which is 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a linear relationship between the ages of the iPhones. Let's denote Suzy's iPhone age as S, Ben's iPhone age as B, and Brandon's iPhone age as Br.

From the information provided, we have the following equations:

1. B = 2S (Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone)
2. Br = 4B (Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone)

Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get:

Br = 4(2S)
Br = 8S

We are given that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, so S = 1. Substituting this value into the equation for Br, we get:

Br = 8(1)
Br = 8

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"Given the scenario, we can model the situation as a problem of projectile motion. Let's denote the initial velocity of the javelin as $v_0$, the angle of projection as $\theta$, and the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone as $d_0 = 400$ feet. When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, her ability to throw the javelin is enhanced, and the new distance is $d = 3d_0 = 1200$ feet.

We can use the range equation for projectile motion to find the angle of projection $\theta$ that allows Polly to hit the dragon from a distance of 1000 feet. The range equation is given by:

$$R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}$$

where $R$ is the range, $v_0$ is the initial velocity, $\theta$ is the angle of projection, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 32.17 ft/s$^2$).

Since we know the distance with and without the gemstone, we can set up a proportion to find the ratio of the initial velocities:

$$\frac{v_0'}{v_0} = 3$$

where $v_0'$ is the initial velocity with the gemstone. We can then use the range equation to find the angle of projection $\theta$ that allows Polly to hit the dragon from a distance of 1000 feet with the gemstone:

$$1000 = \frac{(v_0')^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}$$

Substituting $v_0' = 3v_0$ and solving for $\theta$, we get:

$$1000 = \frac{(3v_0)^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}$$

$$1000 = \frac{9v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}$$

$$\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1000g}{9v_0^2}$$

Since we don't know the initial velocity $v_0$, we can use the fact that the distance without the gemstone is 400 feet:

$$400 = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta_0)}{g}$$

where $\theta_0$ is the angle of projection without the gemstone. We can solve for $v_0$:

$$v_0^2 = \frac{400g}{\sin(2\theta_0)}$$

Substituting this expression for $v_0^2$ into the previous equation, we get:

$$\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1000g}{9 \cdot \frac{400g}{\sin(2\theta_0)}}$$

$$\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1000 \sin(2\theta_0)}{3600}$$

Now, we can solve for $\sin(2\theta)$:

$$\sin(2\theta) = \frac{5}{18} \sin(2\theta_0)$$

Since $\sin(2\theta_0) = \frac{400g}{v_0^2}$, we can substitute this expression into the previous equation:

$$\sin(2\theta) = \frac{5}{18} \cdot \frac{400g}{v_0^2}$$

Substituting $v_0^2 = \frac{400g}{\sin(2\theta_0)}$, we get:

$$\sin(2\theta) = \frac{5}{18} \cdot \frac{400g}{\frac{400g}{\sin(2\theta_0)}}$$

$$\sin(2\theta) = \frac{5}{18} \sin(2\theta_0)$$

Now, we can use the fact that $\sin(2\theta) = \frac{5}{18} \sin(2\theta_0)$ to find the angle of projection $\theta$ that allows Polly to hit the dragon from a distance of 1000 feet with the gemstone.

However, we can simplify the problem by using the fact that the ratio of the distances is equal to the ratio of the initial velocities:

$$\frac{d}{d_0} = \frac{v_0'}{v_0} = 3$$

Since the distance with the gemstone is 1200 feet, we can set up a proportion to find the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames:

$$\frac{d - 1000}{d_0} = \frac{v_0'}{v_0} - 1$$

Substituting $d = 1200$ and $d_0 = 400$, we get:

$$\frac{1200 - 1000}{400} = 3 - 1$$

$$\frac{200}{400} = 2$$

$$\frac{1}{2} = 2$$

This is a contradiction, which means that our initial assumption that Polly can hit the dragon from a distance of 1000 feet with the gemstone is incorrect. However, we can use the fact that the ratio of the distances is equal to the ratio of the initial velocities to find the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames:

$$\frac{d - 1000}{d_0} = \frac{v_0'}{v_0} - 1$$

Substituting $d = 1200$ and $d_0 = 400$, we get:

$$\frac{d - 1000}{400} = 2$$

$$\frac{d - 1000}{400} = 2$$

$$d - 1000 = 800$$

$$d = 1800$$

However, this is the distance with the gemstone. To find the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames, we need to subtract 1000 from this value:

$$d - 1000 = 1800 - 1000$$

$$d = 800$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{800}$"
"To determine the number of pieces of pie taken by the guests, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. Given that Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces, we can calculate the total number of pieces as follows:

Total number of pieces = Number of pies × Number of pieces per pie
= 5 × 8
= 40

Since there were 14 pieces remaining at the end of the evening, we can find the number of pieces taken by the guests by subtracting the remaining pieces from the total:

Number of pieces taken = Total number of pieces - Remaining pieces
= 40 - 14
= 26

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the maximum amount of chips that can be consumed within the remaining daily calorie allowance, we first need to calculate the remaining calories available for consumption. Given a daily calorie target of 2000 and a current consumption of 1800 calories, the remaining calories can be calculated as follows:

Remaining calories = Daily calorie target - Current calories consumed
= 2000 - 1800
= 200 calories

Next, we need to determine the number of servings that can be consumed within this remaining calorie allowance. Each serving of chips contains 250 calories. Therefore, the number of servings that can be consumed is:

Number of servings = Remaining calories / Calories per serving
= 200 / 250
= 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag of chips contains 5 servings, the total weight of chips that can be consumed is:

Total weight of chips = Number of servings * Total weight of the bag
= 0.8 * 300
= 240 grams

Therefore, the maximum amount of chips that can be consumed within the remaining daily calorie allowance is 240 grams.

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To determine Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles, we must first calculate the total revenue and total cost associated with producing and selling 20 candles.

Given that Charlie can produce 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, the cost of supplies for 20 candles is equivalent to 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost of supplies is:

$$\text{Total Cost} = 2 \times \$10.00 = \$20.00$$

The selling price of each candle is $2.00, and Charlie sells 20 candles. Therefore, the total revenue is:

$$\text{Total Revenue} = 20 \times \$2.00 = \$40.00$$

The net profit is calculated as the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:

$$\text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00$$

Therefore, Charlie's net profit from selling 20 candles is $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

Let's start by calculating the number of articles Meredith wrote on each day. On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This can be expressed as:

Tuesday's articles = 5 + (2/5 * 5)
= 5 + 2
= 7 articles

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday:

Wednesday's articles = 2 * 7
= 14 articles

Now, we can calculate the total number of articles written in 3 days:

Total articles = Monday's articles + Tuesday's articles + Wednesday's articles
= 5 + 7 + 14
= 26 articles

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:

Total hours = Total articles * 4 hours/article
= 26 * 4
= 104 hours

The final answer is: 104"
"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. At work, she used 220 Post-it notes, and she had 23 remaining. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes after purchasing the package can be expressed as:

80 (initial) + x (package) - 220 (used) + 23 (remaining)

Simplifying the equation, we have:

x + 23 = 80 + 220 - 23

Combining like terms, we get:

x + 23 = 277 - 23

Subtracting 23 from both sides of the equation yields:

x = 254

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 254.

The final answer is: $\boxed{254}$"
"Given that John purchases twice as many red ties as blue ties and the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, we can model this scenario using a system of linear equations.

Let's denote the number of blue ties as $b$ and the number of red ties as $r$. We are given that $r = 2b$. Additionally, let's denote the cost of each blue tie as $c_b$ and the cost of each red tie as $c_r$. We are given that $c_r = 1.5c_b$.

We are also given that John spent $200 on blue ties, which implies that $bc_b = 200$. Since $c_b = 40$, we can solve for $b$:

$$bc_b = 200 \Rightarrow b(40) = 200 \Rightarrow b = \frac{200}{40} = 5.$$

Now that we know the number of blue ties, we can find the number of red ties using the relationship $r = 2b$:

$$r = 2b = 2(5) = 10.$$

The cost of each red tie is $c_r = 1.5c_b = 1.5(40) = 60$. Therefore, the total cost of the red ties is $10c_r = 10(60) = 600$.

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the cost of blue ties and red ties:

$$\text{Total cost} = bc_b + rc_r = 5(40) + 10(60) = 200 + 600 = 800.$$

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the number of pieces Tracy obtained from the wire, we first need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, as the length of each piece is given in inches. 

Since 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches, we can calculate the total length of the wire in inches as follows:

4 feet = 4 × 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces:

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces from the wire.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units. Given that there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, we can calculate the total number of units as follows:

Total units = Number of floors × Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 × 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units as follows:

Occupied units = Total units × (3/4)
Occupied units = 120 × (3/4)
Occupied units = 90

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Unoccupied units = 30

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To determine Lloyd's weekly revenue from egg sales, we must first calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then convert this quantity to dozens, as eggs are sold in this unit. 

The daily egg production is 252 eggs, and there are 7 days in a week. Therefore, the total number of eggs produced per week is given by the product of these two quantities:

$$
\text{Eggs per week} = 252 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 1764 \, \text{eggs/week}
$$

Since eggs are sold in dozens, we must convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12:

$$
\text{Dozens per week} = \frac{1764 \, \text{eggs/week}}{12 \, \text{eggs/dozen}} = 147 \, \text{dozens/week}
$$

Now, we can calculate Lloyd's weekly revenue by multiplying the number of dozens by the price per dozen:

$$
\text{Weekly revenue} = 147 \, \text{dozens/week} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$294/\text{week}
$$

Therefore, Lloyd's weekly revenue from egg sales is $294."
"To determine the total time Tom spent traveling, we must first calculate the time spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM and the time spent traveling back.

Given that Tom's ship can travel at a constant velocity of 10 miles per hour, we can use the formula $t = \frac{d}{v}$, where $t$ is the time, $d$ is the distance, and $v$ is the velocity.

The distance traveled from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours, which can be calculated as $d = v \cdot t = 10 \, \text{mph} \cdot 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}$.

Using the formula $t = \frac{d}{v}$, we can calculate the time it took to travel 30 miles at 10 miles per hour as $t = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{10 \, \text{mph}} = 3 \, \text{hours}$.

Now, we need to find the time it took to travel back. The distance is the same, 30 miles, and the velocity is 6 miles per hour. Using the same formula, we can calculate the time it took to travel back as $t = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours}$.

The total time Tom spent traveling is the sum of the time spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM and the time spent traveling back, which is $3 \, \text{hours} + 5 \, \text{hours} = 8 \, \text{hours}$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of toys Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we can approach this problem by first calculating the total weight of the comic books he removed. Given that each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

$$\text{Weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}$$

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is:

$$\text{Remaining weight} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}$$

Now, we can calculate the number of toys to be removed by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy, which is 1/2 pound:

$$\text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{\text{Remaining weight}}{\text{Weight of each toy}} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15$$

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the revenue earned by the mechanic, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately for both Thursday and Friday.

Let's denote the number of truck tires repaired on Thursday as $t_{Thursday}$ and the number of car tires repaired on Thursday as $c_{Thursday}$. Similarly, let's denote the number of car tires repaired on Friday as $c_{Friday}$. We are given that $t_{Thursday} = 6$ and $c_{Thursday} = 4$, while $c_{Friday} = 12$ and $t_{Friday} = 0$.

The revenue from truck tires on Thursday is given by $R_{t,Thursday} = 60t_{Thursday} = 60 \cdot 6 = 360$. The revenue from car tires on Thursday is given by $R_{c,Thursday} = 40c_{Thursday} = 40 \cdot 4 = 160$. Therefore, the total revenue on Thursday is $R_{Thursday} = R_{t,Thursday} + R_{c,Thursday} = 360 + 160 = 520$.

The revenue from car tires on Friday is given by $R_{c,Friday} = 40c_{Friday} = 40 \cdot 12 = 480$.

To determine which day had higher revenue, we compare $R_{Thursday}$ and $R_{Friday}$. Since $R_{Thursday} = 520 > R_{Friday} = 480$, Thursday is the day with higher revenue.

To find the difference in revenue between the two days, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue: $R_{Thursday} - R_{Friday} = 520 - 480 = 40$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the total number of kittens in the Doubtfire family, we need to calculate the number of kittens from the adopted kittens and the new kittens from the two house cats.

Let's denote the number of adopted kittens as A = 7. According to the problem, Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which can be expressed as 3A = 3(7) = 21 kittens.

Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

The total number of kittens is the sum of the adopted kittens, Patchy's kittens, and Trixie's kittens: A + 3A + 12 = 7 + 21 + 12.

To find the total, we can combine like terms: 7 + 21 + 12 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"

"To determine the number of times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the maximum number of trips he can afford given his budget of $42 and the cost of a single trip, which includes a ticket for $7 and popcorn for $7, totaling $14.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Number of trips = Total budget / Cost per trip

Substituting the given values, we get:

Number of trips = 42 / 14

To solve for the number of trips, we can divide 42 by 14:

42 ÷ 14 = 3

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times."
"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to calculate the maximum weight allowed on the truck by subtracting the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit. This can be represented as:

Weight limit of the bridge (W_b) = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck (W_d) = 3755 pounds

Maximum weight allowed on the truck (W_max) = W_b - W_d
= 5000 - 3755
= 1245 pounds

Next, we can determine the maximum number of boxes (n) that can be loaded onto the truck by dividing the maximum weight allowed on the truck by the weight of each box (W_box). This can be represented as:

n = W_max / W_box
= 1245 / 15
= 83

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

The final answer is: $\boxed{83}$"
"To determine the final price of Stephen's groceries, we must consider the sequential application of the additional fees and the tip. 

First, we calculate the 25% fee on the final bill of $40.00. This can be expressed as a mathematical operation:

25% of $40.00 = 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00

Next, we add the 25% fee to the final bill:

$40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

Subsequently, we add the delivery fee of $3.00 to the updated total:

$50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the total:

$53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To determine the total number of raspberries on the bush, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. The bush contains 6 clusters of raspberries, each comprising 20 fruit. We can calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters by multiplying the number of clusters by the number of raspberries per cluster:

6 clusters × 20 raspberries per cluster = 120 raspberries

Additionally, there are 67 individual raspberries scattered across the bush. To find the total number of raspberries, we can add the number of raspberries in the clusters to the number of individual raspberries:

120 raspberries + 67 raspberries = 187 raspberries

Therefore, the total number of raspberries on the bush is 187."
"To determine the number of good oranges, we first need to calculate the total number of unripe and bad oranges. 

There are 1 bad oranges and 20% of 25 oranges are unripe. We can express this as a fraction: $\frac{20}{100} \times 25 = \frac{1}{5} \times 25 = 5$ oranges are unripe.

Now, we add the number of bad and unripe oranges to find the total number of oranges that are not good. This is given by $1 + 5 = 6$ oranges.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges. This is given by $25 - 6 = 19$ oranges.

Therefore, the number of good oranges is 19.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to consider the costs associated with the material, the jeweler's services, and the insurance premium.

The cost of the material is $500, and the cost of the jeweler's services is $800. These costs can be added to obtain the total expenditure prior to insurance.

Total cost before insurance = Cost of material + Cost of jeweler
= $500 + $800
= $1300

Next, we need to calculate the insurance premium, which is 10% of the total cost before insurance. This can be computed as follows:

Insurance premium = 10% of $1300
= 0.10 * $1300
= $130

To find the total amount paid, we add the insurance premium to the total cost before insurance:

Total amount paid = Total cost before insurance + Insurance premium
= $1300 + $130
= $1430

Therefore, Janet paid a total of $1430 for the brooch.

The final answer is: $1430"
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to consider the pension structure. For the first 20 years, she receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000. After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. 

Let's denote the value of the pension after 20 years as P. The annual pension for the remaining 10 years is then 5% of P, which can be expressed as 0.05P.

The value of the pension after 20 years (P) is the sum of the annual pension payments for the first 20 years. Since the annual pension is $50,000, we can express this as:

P = 20 \* $50,000

P = $1,000,000

Now, we can calculate the annual pension for the remaining 10 years:

Annual pension for the remaining 10 years = 0.05P
= 0.05 \* $1,000,000
= $50,000

However, this is the additional amount she receives each year. To find the total annual pension after 30 years, we need to add this to the fixed annual pension of $50,000:

Total annual pension after 30 years = $50,000 + $50,000
= $100,000

The final answer is: $100,000."
"To determine the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, and then add them together.

The streaming service charges Aleena $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year consists of 6 months, and the second half of the year also consists of 6 months.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 \* $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, she paid 10% less than the initial amount, which is 90% of the initial amount. This can be calculated as 0.9 \* $140 = $126.

For the second half of the year, Aleena paid 6 \* $126 = $756.

The total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

The final answer is: $1596"
"To determine the distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. This can be done by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = \frac{distance}{gas\ used} = \frac{100\ miles}{4\ gallons} = 25\ miles/gallon

Given that the car's fuel tank has a capacity of 12 gallons, we can now calculate the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity by the mpg rating.

total\ miles = tank\ capacity \times mpg = 12\ gallons \times 25\ miles/gallon = 300\ miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine the total time spent on TV and reading, we can break down the problem into manageable components. 

First, let's calculate the time spent on TV and reading in a single day. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half as long, which is 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour. Therefore, the total time spent on TV and reading in a day is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since this pattern is repeated 7 times a week, we can calculate the total time spent on TV and reading in a week by multiplying the daily time by 7: 3 hours * 7 days = 21 hours.

To find the total time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we can multiply the weekly time by 4: 21 hours * 4 = 84 hours.

The final answer is: 84"

In addition to the students, each school has two coaches, one for each team. Consequently, the total number of individuals per school is 10 (students) + 2 (coaches) = 12.

Since there are four schools participating in the tournament, the total number of individuals sent by all the schools is 4 * 12 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the total number of gems in the treasure chest, we can utilize a systematic approach by first identifying the quantities of each type of gemstone.

Let's denote the number of diamonds as D, the number of rubies as R, and the number of emeralds as E. We are given that D = 175, R = D - 35, and E = 2R.

Substituting the value of D into the equation for R, we get R = 175 - 35 = 140. Then, substituting the value of R into the equation for E, we get E = 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, we can calculate the total number of gems by summing the quantities of each type of gemstone: Total gems = D + R + E = 175 + 140 + 280.

Performing the arithmetic, we find that Total gems = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.

Therefore, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 595."
"Given the problem, we can apply basic principles of ratio and proportion to determine the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school. 

Let's denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B. We are given that B = 2G. Since there are 60 girls, we can substitute this value into the equation to find the number of boys: B = 2 * 60 = 120.

The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is G + B = 60 + 120 = 180.

We are also given that there are 5 students to every teacher. This implies a student-teacher ratio of 5:1. To find the number of teachers, we can divide the total number of students by 5.

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
= 180 / 5
= 36

Therefore, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is 36.

"To determine the average square footage of a level in the sandcastle, we can employ a geometric progression to model the decreasing square footage of each level. Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, we can express the square footage of each subsequent level as a function of the previous level.

Let's denote the square footage of the top level as $a_1 = 16$. The second level will have a square footage of $a_2 = \frac{1}{2}a_1 = \frac{1}{2}(16) = 8$. Similarly, the third level will have a square footage of $a_3 = \frac{1}{2}a_2 = \frac{1}{2}(8) = 4$, and the fourth level will have a square footage of $a_4 = \frac{1}{2}a_3 = \frac{1}{2}(4) = 2$.

The total square footage of the sandcastle is the sum of the square footage of all levels, which can be expressed as $S_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30$.

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels, which is 4. Therefore, the average square footage of a level is $\frac{S_n}{n} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5$.

"To determine the total amount of dog food required for the puppy in the first year, we need to calculate the amount of food consumed during the initial 180 days and the remaining days of the year.

The puppy consumes 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. Therefore, the total amount of food consumed during this period is given by the product of the daily consumption rate and the duration:

$$\text{Initial Food Consumption} = 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups}$$

For the remaining days of the year, the puppy consumes 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the number of remaining days is:

$$\text{Remaining Days} = 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days}$$

The total amount of food consumed during the remaining days is:

$$\text{Remaining Food Consumption} = 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups}$$

The total amount of dog food required for the puppy in the first year is the sum of the initial and remaining food consumption:

$$\text{Total Food Consumption} = \text{Initial Food Consumption} + \text{Remaining Food Consumption} = 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups}$$

Given that one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags required for the puppy in the first year is:

$$\text{Total Bags} = \frac{\text{Total Food Consumption}}{\text{Food per Bag}} = \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags}$$

Therefore, the total number of bags of dog food required for the puppy in the first year is 5.

"Given that Sarah's laundry output is 400 pounds, we can establish a proportional relationship between the individuals' laundry contributions. Let's denote David's laundry output as D, Sarah's as S, and Raymond's as R.

We are given that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, which can be expressed as S = 4D. Since Sarah's laundry output is 400 pounds, we can solve for David's output:

S = 4D
400 = 4D
D = 400 / 4
D = 100 pounds

Next, we are told that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. This can be expressed as R = S/2. Substituting Sarah's output of 400 pounds, we can solve for Raymond's output:

R = S/2
R = 400/2
R = 200 pounds

Now, we can calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

Difference = R - D
= 200 - 100
= 100 pounds

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds.

"To determine the optimal purchasing strategy for Vincent, we need to compare the cost per flower of each package. 

Let's denote the cost per flower for the package of 3 flowers as $C_3 and the cost per flower for the package of 2 flowers as $C_2. We can express these costs as:

C_3 = \frac{2.50}{3} = \frac{5}{6} dollars per flower
C_2 = \frac{1}{2} dollars per flower

Since C_2 < C_3, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. We can express this as:

N_2 = \frac{18}{2} = 9 packages of 2 flowers
Cost_2 = N_2 \times C_2 = 9 \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{9}{2} dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers:

N_3 = \frac{18}{3} = 6 packages of 3 flowers
Cost_3 = N_3 \times C_3 = 6 \times \frac{5}{6} = 5 dollars

The difference in cost is:

ΔCost = Cost_3 - Cost_2 = 5 - \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2} dollars

"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of games the team lost as L and the number of games they won as W. We are given that W = L + 8 and W + L = 22.

We can rewrite the second equation as L + W = 22. Substituting W from the first equation into the second equation yields L + (L + 8) = 22.

Combining like terms, we get 2L + 8 = 22. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we obtain 2L = 14. Dividing both sides by 2, we find L = 7.

Now that we have determined the number of games lost, we can calculate the number of games won by substituting L into the first equation: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"

"Given that Sylvie's initial annual salary is $600 and the company policy dictates a 10% annual increase for employees who have completed five years of service, we can model this situation using a geometric progression.

Let's denote the initial salary as $600 and the annual increase as 10% of the current salary, which is $60. After five years, Sylvie's salary will be the sum of the initial salary and the cumulative increase over the five years, which is $600 + ($60 * 5) = $900.

To find Sylvie's salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the salary for the next three years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply the increase to the salary after five years.

The salary after six years will be $900 + (10% of $900) = $900 + $90 = $990. We can continue this process for the next two years.

Salary after seven years: $990 + (10% of $990) = $990 + $99 = $1089
Salary after eight years: $1089 + (10% of $1089) = $1089 + $108.9 = $1197.9
Salary after nine years: $1197.9 + (10% of $1197.9) = $1197.9 + $119.79 = $1317.69

The final numerical answer is: $1317.69"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combining like terms, we get:

11H = 88,000

To solve for H, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11

H = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8000}$"
"To determine the total cost of gift bags for Christina's birthday party, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend. Given that 1/4 of the invited guests do not show up, we can express this as a fraction of the total number of guests.

Let's denote the total number of guests as $n$. The number of guests who do not show up is $\frac{1}{4}n$. Therefore, the number of guests who will attend is $n - \frac{1}{4}n = \frac{3}{4}n$.

We are given that Christina invited 16 friends, so we can substitute $n = 16$ into the equation to find the number of guests who will attend:

$\frac{3}{4} \cdot 16 = 12$

Now, we need to calculate the total number of gift bags required. Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75:

$12 \cdot 0.75 = 9$

Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the gift bags by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag, which is $2:

$9 \cdot 2 = 18$

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad required for the dinosaur picnic, we must consider the consumption patterns of both adult and juvenile dinosaurs. Given that an adult dinosaur consumes 10 pounds of potato salad, and a child consumes half as much as an adult, we can calculate the total amount of potato salad needed.

Let's denote the number of adult dinosaurs as A and the number of child dinosaurs as C. We are given that A = 20 and C = 5.

The total amount of potato salad consumed by adult dinosaurs can be calculated as 10A = 10 * 20 = 200 pounds.

The total amount of potato salad consumed by child dinosaurs can be calculated as 10C/2 = 10 * 5/2 = 25 pounds.

To find the total amount of potato salad required, we add the amounts consumed by adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

Therefore, Ted the T-Rex needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to ensure that everyone is fed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a linear relationship between the number of pets each individual possesses. Let's denote the number of pets Cindy has as C, Marcia's pets as M, and Jan's pets as J.

We are given that Cindy has 4 pets, so C = 4. It is also stated that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, which can be expressed as M = C + 2. Substituting the value of C, we get M = 4 + 2 = 6.

Furthermore, we know that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, which can be represented as J = 3M. Substituting the value of M, we get J = 3(6) = 18.

To find the total number of pets, we can sum the number of pets each person has: Total = C + M + J = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28.

Therefore, the total number of pets the three individuals have is 28."
"To determine the age of Jackson, we can establish a series of relationships between the children's ages based on the given information.

Let's denote the age of Corey as C, Amy as A, Jackson as J, and James as M. We are given the following equations:

1. M = 10 (James is 10 years old)
2. C = M + 1 (Corey is 1 year older than James)
3. A = C - 2 (Amy is 2 years younger than Corey)
4. A = J + 5 (Amy is 5 years older than Jackson)

Substituting equation (2) into equation (3), we get:
A = (M + 1) - 2
A = 10 + 1 - 2
A = 9

Now, substituting the value of A into equation (4), we get:
9 = J + 5
J = 9 - 5
J = 4

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine Gerald's new time, we first need to establish his original time. Given that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and is two seconds faster than Gerald, we can express Gerald's original time as $t_G = t_L + 2$, where $t_G$ is Gerald's original time and $t_L$ is Lee's time. Substituting Lee's time, we get $t_G = 38 + 2 = 40$ seconds.

Gerald's speed improvement is 10%, which can be expressed as a decimal by dividing by 100: $0.10$. To find the time saved due to the improvement, we multiply Gerald's original time by the decimal representation of the improvement: $0.10 \times t_G = 0.10 \times 40 = 4$ seconds.

Now, we can find Gerald's new time by subtracting the time saved from his original time: $t_{G,new} = t_G - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36$ seconds.

Therefore, Gerald's new time is 36 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"Given the problem statement, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits in the neighborhood.

Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of rabbits as R. We are given the following information:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats: R = D + C - 12.
2. There are two cats for every dog: C = 2D.
3. The number of dogs is 60: D = 60.

Substituting the value of D into the second equation, we get C = 2(60) = 120.

Now, we can substitute the values of D and C into the first equation to find the number of rabbits: R = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: Total = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348.

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348.

The final answer is: $\boxed{348}$"
"To determine the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to calculate the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = (2/5) × 200 = 80

Consequently, the number of girls can be determined by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys = 200 - 80 = 120

Next, we need to find the number of girls in the girl scout. It is given that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) × Number of girls = (2/3) × 120 = 80

Finally, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the difference in sleep duration between Harry and James, we first need to calculate the number of hours James slept. Given that James slept 2/3 of the hours Harry slept, we can express this as a mathematical equation:

Let H represent the number of hours Harry slept, and J represent the number of hours James slept. We are given that H = 9 hours. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

J = (2/3)H

Substituting the value of H, we get:

J = (2/3)(9)
J = 6

Now, we can calculate the difference in sleep duration between Harry and James by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

Difference = H - J
Difference = 9 - 6
Difference = 3

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of tomatoes used by Freda, we can approach this problem by first understanding the relationship between the volume of the tomatoes before and after cooking. Given that the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, we can express this as a ratio of the final volume to the initial volume, which is 1:2.

Let's denote the initial volume of the tomatoes as V_i and the final volume of the sauce as V_f. We are given that V_f = 32 ounces. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume, we can express the relationship as V_i = 2 * V_f. Substituting the given value, we get V_i = 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can calculate the number of cans used by dividing the initial volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we can calculate the total number of tomatoes used by multiplying the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

Therefore, the number of tomatoes used by Freda is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. 

Given that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars in the first 15 minutes and the cars in the remaining 15 minutes, which is x + 20.

We are also given that the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

x = 25 - 20
x = 5

Thus, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we need to calculate the total number of plants she initially possesses and then subtract the number of plants she gives away.

First, we calculate the initial number of plants on the window ledges. Since Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, we can express this as a product of the number of plants per ledge and the total number of ledges: 2 * 40 = 80.

Next, we account for the 18 new potted plants she received from the nursery. Adding these to the initial number of plants, we get 80 + 18 = 98.

However, Mary decides to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges. This can be expressed as 40 * 1 = 40 plants given away.

To find the number of plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants: 98 - 40 = 58.

Therefore, Mary will have 58 potted plants remaining.

The final answer is: $\boxed{58}$"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we can analyze the given information and apply basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the number of doorbell rings by each friend as follows:
- The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
- The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, which is $20 + \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 20\right) = 20 + 5 = 25$ times.
- The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, and the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. Therefore, the third friend pressed the doorbell $60 + 10 = 70$ times.

Now, we can calculate the total number of doorbell rings by summing the individual counts:
$20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175$

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day, we must first calculate the total number of pages he has to read. This can be achieved by summing the pages from each textbook.

Let's denote the number of pages from the Science textbook as S, Social Studies as SS, History as H, and Geography as G. We are given that S = 4, SS = 20, H = 7, and G = 8. Therefore, the total number of pages is:

S + SS + H + G = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract this from the total to find the remaining pages:

39 - 15 = 24

Now, we need to calculate the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day. We know he has 4 more days to complete his reading. The average number of pages per day can be calculated as follows:

Average pages per day = Total remaining pages / Number of days
= 24 / 4
= 6

Therefore, Solo needs to read 6 pages on average per day to complete his reading within the given timeframe.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we can break down his daily water consumption into two categories: weekdays and weekends.

On weekdays, John consumes 4 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed). Since there are 5 weekdays, his total water consumption on weekdays is 4 glasses/day * 5 days = 20 glasses.

On weekends, John consumes 3 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and one before bed) and 1 glass of soda with dinner. Therefore, his total water consumption on weekends is 3 glasses/day * 2 days = 6 glasses.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add his weekday and weekend water consumption: 20 glasses (weekdays) + 6 glasses (weekends) = 26 glasses.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can utilize the concept of rate and proportionality. The fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes, which can be expressed as a rate of 3 miles / 10 minutes.

Given that the city spans 42 miles from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, we can calculate the time it takes to cover the entire city by dividing the total distance by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

Let's denote the time it takes to cover the city as t (in minutes). We can set up a proportion to relate the rate of the fog bank to the total distance of the city:

(3 miles / 10 minutes) = (42 miles / t minutes)

To solve for t, we can cross-multiply:

3t = 42 * 10

Now, we can solve for t by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:

t = (42 * 10) / 3

t = 420 / 3

t = 140 minutes

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. First, we need to determine the number of pieces Poppy placed on the board, which is a quarter of the total 1000 pieces. This can be calculated as:

$$\frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250$$

Now, we need to find the number of pieces left after Poppy placed 250 pieces. This is given by:

$$1000 - 250 = 750$$

Next, we need to calculate the number of pieces her mom placed, which is a third of the remaining 750 pieces. This can be calculated as:

$$\frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250$$

Finally, we need to find the number of pieces left after her mom placed 250 pieces. This is given by:

$$750 - 250 = 500$$

Therefore, there are 500 pieces left to be placed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{500}$"
"Given that Cody consumes three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir's cookie consumption is 5 units, we can express Cody's cookie consumption as 3 times Amir's consumption. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Cody's cookies = 3 × Amir's cookies
Cody's cookies = 3 × 5
Cody's cookies = 15

To determine the total number of cookies consumed by both individuals, we sum their individual cookie consumptions:

Total cookies = Amir's cookies + Cody's cookies
Total cookies = 5 + 15
Total cookies = 20

Therefore, the total number of cookies consumed by both individuals is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total inner volume of the three boxes, we must first calculate the inner dimensions of each box. Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension to account for the thickness on both sides.

The length of the box is 5 inches, so the inner length is $5 - 2 = 3$ inches. The width is 6 inches, so the inner width is $6 - 2 = 4$ inches. The height is 4 inches, so the inner height is $4 - 2 = 2$ inches.

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: $V_{\text{inner}} = (5 - 2)(6 - 2)(4 - 2) = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24$ cubic inches.

Since there are three identical boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to obtain the total inner volume: $V_{\text{total}} = 3 \times 24 = 72$ cubic inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total time spent watching TV and subtracting the time spent watching other episodes.

Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday as $x$. The total time spent watching 1-hour episodes is 2 hours (Monday and Tuesday) + 1 hour (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 5 hours. 

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. Therefore, the time spent watching 30-minute episodes is $7 - 5 = 2$ hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is equivalent to 0.5 hours, we can set up the equation $0.5x = 2$ to represent the time spent watching 30-minute episodes. Solving for $x$, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
0.5x &= 2 \\
x &= \frac{2}{0.5} \\
x &= 4
\end{aligned}
$$

However, this result seems inconsistent with the given information. Let's re-examine the problem. We know that Frankie watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show on Wednesday. If we denote the number of 30-minute episodes as $x$, the total time spent watching 30-minute episodes on Wednesday is $0.5x$ hours.

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. We can set up the equation $2 + 1.5 + 2 + 0.5x = 7$ to represent the total time spent watching TV, where 2 hours is the time spent watching 1-hour episodes on Monday and Tuesday, 1.5 hours is the time spent watching 1-hour and 30-minute episodes on Thursday, and 2 hours is the time spent watching 1-hour episodes on Friday.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2 + 1.5 + 2 + 0.5x &= 7 \\
5.5 + 0.5x &= 7 \\
0.5x &= 7 - 5.5 \\
0.5x &= 1.5 \\
x &= \frac{1.5}{0.5} \\
x &= 3
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x. This year, he intended to bake twice as many cookies, which would be 2x. However, he inadvertently baked 15 more cookies than planned, resulting in a total of 2x + 15 cookies.

After dropping 5 cookies, Henry is left with 110 cookies. This situation can be represented by the equation 2x + 15 - 5 = 110. Simplifying this equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.

To isolate the variable x, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation, yielding 2x = 100. Dividing both sides by 2, we obtain x = 50.

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we can apply a straightforward calculation based on the given parameters.

Let's denote the cost of gas per gallon as $3.00 and the cashback reward per gallon as $0.20. Given that the individual purchases 10 gallons of gas, we can calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards as follows:

Total cost of gas without rewards = 10 gallons × $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

Next, we calculate the total cashback rewards earned:

Total cashback rewards = 10 gallons × $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, to find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we subtract the total cashback rewards from the total cost of gas without rewards:

Total cost of gas after rewards = Total cost of gas without rewards - Total cashback rewards
= $30.00 - $2.00
= $28.00

Therefore, the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00.

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each consumed. This can be achieved by multiplying the width of each roll-up by its length.

Let's denote the width of Beatrice's roll-ups as $w_B = 2$ and the length as $l_B = 24$. Similarly, for Marcell's roll-ups, the width is $w_M = 3$ and the length is $l_M = 14$.

The total number of roll-ups eaten by Beatrice is given by the product of her roll-up dimensions: $N_B = w_B \cdot l_B = 2 \cdot 24 = 48$. For Marcell, the total number of roll-ups is $N_M = w_M \cdot l_M = 3 \cdot 14 = 42$.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to calculate the mean of the total number of roll-ups consumed by both individuals. This can be done by adding the total number of roll-ups eaten by each and dividing by 2: $\frac{N_B + N_M}{2} = \frac{48 + 42}{2} = \frac{90}{2} = 45$.

Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 45.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To determine the amount of water the boat took on, we need to calculate the rate at which the boat is taking on water and then multiply it by the total time it took to reach the shore.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it rows. Since it took 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the rate of rowing in feet per second: 

$$\frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}.$$

Now, let's find the total distance rowed in 64 seconds:

$$\text{Distance} = \text{rate} \times \text{time} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet}.$$

Since the boat takes on water at a rate of 2 liters for every 10 feet, we can find the number of sets of 10 feet rowed:

$$\text{Number of sets} = \frac{\text{total distance}}{10} = \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10} = 8 \text{ sets}.$$

Now, we can find the total amount of water taken on:

$$\text{Total water} = \text{number of sets} \times 2 \text{ liters/set} = 8 \text{ sets} \times 2 \text{ liters/set} = 16 \text{ liters}.$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to consider the frequency of usage and cleaning. Given that each teacher has 2 lessons per day and uses the whiteboard in each lesson, we can calculate the total number of lessons as follows:

Let T represent the number of teachers, L represent the number of lessons per teacher, and C represent the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson. The total number of lessons per day is given by the product of the number of teachers and the number of lessons per teacher:

T * L = 4 * 2 = 8

Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is the product of the total number of lessons and the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson:

Total cleanings per day = (T * L) * C
= 8 * 3
= 24

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted and subtract the ones that did not grow. This is a straightforward application of arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the number of flowers Ryan plants per day as $f$ and the number of days he plants flowers as $d$. In this case, $f = 2$ and $d = 15$. The total number of flowers planted can be calculated as the product of the number of flowers planted per day and the number of days:

$f \cdot d = 2 \cdot 15 = 30$

However, we are given that 5 of these flowers did not grow. To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to subtract the number of flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted:

Total flowers = $f \cdot d - 5 = 30 - 5 = 25$

Therefore, the total number of flowers Ryan has is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To solve this problem, we can establish a relationship between the number of photographs that Jamal's and Brittany's phones can hold. Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo as D.

From the given information, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:

B + 6B = 1800

Simplifying the equation, we get:

7B = 1800

Dividing both sides by 7, we find:

B = 1800 / 7
B = 257.14 (round down to the nearest whole number since the number of photographs must be a whole number)

However, since the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number, which is 257.

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:

B = 50D

Substituting the value of B, we get:

257 = 50D

Dividing both sides by 50, we find:

D = 257 / 50
D = 5.14 (round down to the nearest whole number since the number of birds must be a whole number)

However, since the number of birds in Jamal's photograph must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number, which is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the profit made from selling the lumber, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total revenue from its sale.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 each = $100. This can be expressed as 10 \* 10 = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 each = $80. This can be expressed as 5 \* 16 = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is the sum of the costs of the two types of boards, which is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have increased by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. This can be expressed as 1.5 \* P, where P is the original price.

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 1.5 \* 10 = $15 each.

The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 1.5 \* 16 = $24 each.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 each = $150. This can be expressed as 10 \* 15 = $150.

The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 each = $120. This can be expressed as 5 \* 24 = $120.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenues from the two types of boards, which is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"Given the ratio of sugar to water in Katy's coffee mixture is 7:13, we can express this as a fraction, 7/13. The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20. 

To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we can use the concept of proportions. Let x be the total number of teaspoonfuls of the mixture. We can set up the proportion: 7/20 = 7/x. However, we are given that the total number of teaspoonfuls of the mixture is 120. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7/20 = 7/120.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 7 * 120 = 20 * 7. This simplifies to 840 = 140. However, this is not what we want. We want to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar, which is 7/20 of the total mixture. 

To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar, we can multiply the total number of teaspoonfuls of the mixture by the fraction of sugar: (7/20) * 120 = 7 * (120/20) = 7 * 6 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To determine the total amount John paid for the shoes, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. Specifically, we will utilize the concept of multiplication to calculate the total cost.

First, we identify the number of pairs of shoes purchased for each child, which is 2. The cost of each pair is $60. To find the total cost for one child, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair: 2 * $60 = $120.

Next, we need to account for the fact that John has 3 children. To find the total cost for all children, we multiply the cost for one child by the number of children: $120 * 3 = $360.

Therefore, the total amount John paid for the shoes is $360.

The final answer is: $360"
"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of containers imported on the second day as 'x'. 

We know that the initial number of containers was 2, each containing 5 vehicles, resulting in a total of 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles. On the second day, 'x' containers were added, each containing 5 vehicles, resulting in a total of 5x vehicles. The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30.

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 10 + 5x = 30.

To solve for 'x', we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation, yielding 5x = 20. Then, we divide both sides by 5, resulting in x = 4.

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we can apply the concept of percentage increase and the relationship between Adrien's and Lylah's salaries.

Let's denote Adrien's salary four years ago as A = $40000. Given that his salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Lylah's salary as L = 0.7A = 0.7 * $40000 = $28000.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, which can be calculated as 0.4A = 0.4 * $40000 = $16000. Therefore, his new salary is A + 0.4A = 1.4A = $56000.

Similarly, Lylah's salary increased by 40% of her original salary, which is 0.4L = 0.4 * $28000 = $11200. Thus, her new salary is L + 0.4L = 1.4L = $39200.

To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries: A + L + 0.4A + 0.4L = 1.4A + 1.4L = 2.4(A + L) = 2.4($40000 + $28000) = 2.4 * $68000 = $163200.

However, we can also express the total salary as 1.4(A + L), since both Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased by 40% of their original values. Therefore, the total salary is 1.4($68000) = $95200.

The final answer is: $95200"
"To determine the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month, we must first establish the rate at which he consumes paper. Given that he uses 2 pads of paper per week, and each pad contains 30 sheets, his weekly consumption can be calculated as follows:

2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the monthly consumption by multiplying the weekly rate by the number of weeks in a month:

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"To determine the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael have, we need to calculate the number of fruits each individual brought and then sum them together.

Let's denote the number of apples Morisette brought as $A_M$ and the number of oranges as $O_M$. We are given that $A_M = 5$ and $O_M = 8$. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so the number of apples Kael brought is $A_K = 2A_M = 2 \cdot 5 = 10$. Similarly, Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so the number of oranges Kael brought is $O_K = \frac{1}{2}O_M = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 8 = 4$.

The total number of fruits Morisette brought is $F_M = A_M + O_M = 5 + 8 = 13$. The total number of fruits Kael brought is $F_K = A_K + O_K = 10 + 4 = 14$.

Therefore, the total number of fruits they have in total is $F_{total} = F_M + F_K = 13 + 14 = 27$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we can break down her sleep pattern into distinct periods. 

Let's denote the hours she slept on Monday as $M = 8$. For the subsequent two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so we can express the hours slept on these days as $T = W = M - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6$.

For the remaining days of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so we can express the hours slept on these days as $S = 7$, where $S$ represents the hours slept on each of the days Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

Now, we can calculate the total hours she slept for each day:
- Monday: $M = 8$
- Tuesday: $T = 6$
- Wednesday: $W = 6$
- Thursday: $S = 7$
- Friday: $S = 7$
- Saturday: $S = 7$
- Sunday: $S = 7$

To find the total hours, we can sum the hours slept each day: $M + T + W + S + S + S + S = 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 48$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she runs at two different speeds: 10 miles per hour for 3 hours and 5 miles per hour for the remaining time.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. This can be calculated using the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time:

$$d = v \cdot t$$

where $d$ is the distance, $v$ is the speed, and $t$ is the time. Substituting the given values, we get:

$$d_{10mph} = 10 \, \text{mph} \cdot 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}$$

Next, we need to calculate the remaining time after 3 hours. The total time is 7 hours, so the remaining time is:

$$t_{\text{remaining}} = t_{\text{total}} - t_{\text{already run}} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours}$$

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours:

$$d_{5mph} = 5 \, \text{mph} \cdot 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}$$

Finally, we add the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour to get the total distance:

$$d_{\text{total}} = d_{10mph} + d_{5mph} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of letters in the already-stamped pile as x. When Jennie stamps one-third of the letters needing stamps, she adds 20 letters to the already-stamped pile. This results in a total of 30 letters in the already-stamped pile.

We can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 30

Subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

From the information provided, we know that Julia initially had 'x' spoons. Her husband then gave her 5 additional spoons, bringing the total to 'x + 5' spoons. After using 3 spoons for sampling, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. 

We can set up the equation: x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package Julia bought is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. Let's denote the number of chicken sausages as C and the number of fish sausages as F. We are given that C = 38 and F = C + 6.

We can express the total number of sausages, T, as the sum of the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: T = C + F.

Substituting the given values, we get T = 38 + (38 + 6).

Using the associative property of addition, we can rewrite this expression as T = 38 + 38 + 6.

Now, we can combine the like terms: T = 76 + 6.

Finally, we can evaluate the expression to find the total number of sausages: T = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. Given that Lily has 50 friends, and Amy has 20 more friends than Lily, we can express Amy's number of friends as 50 + 20 = 70.

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we can simply add the number of friends Lily and Amy have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Dillon will spend at the local store, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them together.

First, let's establish the cost of each item. The cost of a pepper is given as $15. Since a watermelon costs three times the cost of a pepper, we can express this relationship as:

Watermelon cost = 3 × Pepper cost
Watermelon cost = 3 × $15
Watermelon cost = $45

Next, we know that the cost of an orange is 5 dollars less than the cost of a watermelon:

Orange cost = Watermelon cost - $5
Orange cost = $45 - $5
Orange cost = $40

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- The cost of 4 watermelons is 4 × $45 = $180.
- The cost of 20 peppers is 20 × $15 = $300.
- The cost of 10 oranges is 10 × $40 = $400.

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we sum the costs of the watermelons, peppers, and oranges:

Total cost = Watermelon cost + Pepper cost + Orange cost
Total cost = $180 + $300 + $400
Total cost = $880

The final answer is: $880"
"To determine the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total revenue generated from patient visits.

First, we calculate the total time spent by doctors. Given that each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, we can multiply the number of patients by the average time per patient.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total minutes to hours.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The total cost for the doctors is the number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly rate.

Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Next, we calculate the total revenue generated from patient visits. The hospital charges $200 per hour to each patient. To find the total revenue, we need to calculate the total hours spent by patients and multiply it by the hourly rate.

Since each patient is seen for 24 minutes, we can convert this to hours.

24 minutes / 60 = 0.4 hours

The total hours spent by all patients is the number of patients multiplied by the hours per patient.

Total hours = 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours

The total revenue is the total hours spent by patients multiplied by the hourly rate.

Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40000

However, this is not the correct total revenue, as the hospital charges the patients for the time spent by the doctors. To find the correct total revenue, we need to multiply the number of patients by the hourly rate charged to the patients and the hours spent by the doctors.

Total revenue = 500 patients * $200/hour * (200 hours / 500 patients) = 500 * $200 * (2) = $200000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $200000 - $30000
Profit = $170000

The final answer is: $170000"
"To determine the number of elves left after the incidents, we can apply a step-by-step approach.

Initially, there are 60 elves. A third of them quit after being subjected to unpleasant situations, which can be calculated as follows:

60 / 3 = 20

So, 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Subsequently, 10 more elves quit after being kicked by children. Therefore, the updated number of elves is:

40 - 10 = 30

Thus, there are 30 elves remaining.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total expenditure for the two months, we can calculate the expenditure in June by subtracting $60 from the expenditure in May, which was $500. This yields an expenditure in June of $440.

The total expenditure can then be calculated by summing the expenditures in May and June: $500 + $440 = $940.

Therefore, the total expenditure for the two months is $940."
"To determine the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred at the carnival, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of rides each individual took and then multiplying it by the cost of each ride.

Let's denote the number of rides Pam took as $P$ and the number of rides Fred took as $F$. We know that Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so $P = 2 + 2 = 4$. Similarly, Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so $F = 4 + 2 = 6$.

The total number of rides is the sum of the rides taken by Pam and Fred, which is $P + F = 4 + 6 = 10$ rides.

Given that each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is the product of the total number of rides and the cost per ride, which is $10 \times 6 = 60$ tickets.

Therefore, the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred at the carnival is 60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can utilize a linear equation to model the situation. Let's denote the number of miles walked on Monday as M, the number of miles walked on Tuesday as T, and the number of miles walked on Wednesday as W.

Given that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday, we have M = 4. Additionally, we know that he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, so T = 6M = 6(4) = 24.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles, which can be represented by the equation M + T + W = 41. Substituting the known values for M and T, we get 4 + 24 + W = 41.

Simplifying the equation, we have 28 + W = 41. To isolate W, we subtract 28 from both sides of the equation, yielding W = 41 - 28 = 13.

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the annual expenditure on car washes, we can employ a straightforward calculation based on the given information. Tom receives 4 car washes per month, and each car wash costs $15.

First, we calculate the monthly expenditure by multiplying the number of car washes by the cost per car wash:

4 car washes/month × $15/car wash = $60/month

Next, to find the annual expenditure, we multiply the monthly expenditure by 12, which represents the number of months in a year:

$60/month × 12 months/year = $720/year

Therefore, Tom's annual expenditure on car washes is $720.

The final answer is: $720"
"To determine the number of video games Bobby has, we must first establish the number of video games Brian possesses after losing 5. Given that Brian initially has 20 video games, we can express this as:

Brian's remaining video games = Initial video games - Lost video games
= 20 - 5
= 15

Now, we can express the relationship between Brian's and Bobby's video games as an equation. Let B represent the number of video games Bobby has. We are given that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. This can be expressed as:

B = 3(15) - 5

To solve for B, we first multiply 3 by 15:

3(15) = 45

Then, we subtract 5 from the result:

B = 45 - 5
= 40

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the number of female Scottish unicorns, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to calculate the number of unicorns residing in the Scottish Highlands. Given that one third of the total 27 unicorns are located in this region, we can express this as a fraction:

$$\frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9$$

This indicates that there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we need to find the proportion of female unicorns within this subset. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this as:

$$\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6$$

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we must first calculate the cost of the items, then add the delivery fee, and finally, include the tip.

The cost of the items can be calculated as follows:

1. The cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each is 2 \* $7.50 = $15.00.
2. The cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each is 2 \* $1.50 = $3.00.
3. The cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each is 2 \* $1.00 = $2.00.
4. The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

Next, we need to calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost of the items. This can be expressed as 0.20 \* $20.00 = $4.00. Therefore, the total cost with the delivery fee is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Finally, we add the tip of $5.00 to the total cost with the delivery fee, resulting in a total cost of $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

The final numerical answer is: $29.00"
"To determine the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in both tests and subtract that from the total number of questions in both tests.

Let's denote the time taken to complete the first test as $t_1$ and the time taken to complete the second test as $t_2$. We know that Mark completed 75 questions in the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Therefore, we can express the time taken to complete the first test as $t_1 = \frac{75}{5} = 15$ hours. However, since Mark only had 8 hours to complete the test, he actually completed $\frac{8}{t_1} \cdot 5 = 40$ questions in the first test.

Similarly, for the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. The time taken to complete the second test is $t_2 = \frac{100}{5} = 20$ hours. However, since Mark only had 6 hours, he completed $\frac{6}{t_2} \cdot 5 = 30$ questions in the second test.

The total number of questions completed is $40 + 30 = 70$. The total number of questions in both tests is $75 + 100 = 175$. Therefore, the number of questions left incomplete is $175 - 70 = 105$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{105}$"
"Given that there are 12 blue gumballs in the candy machine, we can establish a relationship between the number of blue and pink gumballs. Let's denote the number of pink gumballs as P and the number of blue gumballs as B. According to the problem statement, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be expressed as:

P = 4B + 22

Substituting the given value of B = 12 into the equation, we get:

P = 4(12) + 22
P = 48 + 22
P = 70

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs in the candy machine is 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars among the available fleet, we first need to calculate the number of semi-automatic vehicles. Given that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual, we can calculate the number of semi-automatic cars as follows:

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars using the formula:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) × 100
= (4 / 20) × 100
= 0.2 × 100
= 20%

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars in the fleet is 20%.

The final answer is: 20"
"Given that there are 700 bees in a hive, with twice as many worker bees as baby bees and twice as many babies as queens, we can establish a system of linear equations to solve for the number of worker bees.

Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q. 

We are given that W = 2B, which represents the relationship between the number of worker bees and baby bees. Additionally, B = 2Q, indicating that the number of baby bees is twice the number of queens.

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can express this as the equation W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B into the equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation to get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we have the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees by substituting Q = 100 into the equation B = 2Q, which yields B = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can determine the number of worker bees by substituting B = 200 into the equation W = 2B, resulting in W = 2(200) = 400.

Therefore, the number of worker bees in the hive is 400.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the total earnings of an individual who allocates their leisure time to gainfully employed activities, we must first calculate the additional hours worked and then multiply this by their hourly wage.

Given that Jordan dedicates 2 hours daily to leisure activities, which he could otherwise utilize for employment, we can calculate the additional hours worked in a week as follows:

Additional hours worked per week = 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

Jordan's hourly wage is $10. Therefore, the total earnings for the week can be calculated as:

Total earnings = Additional hours worked per week * Hourly wage
               = 14 hours/week * $10/hour
               = $140/week

The final answer is: $140"
"To determine the total cost of the items purchased by John, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together, taking into account the 10% tax on non-food items.

First, let's calculate the cost of food items. The cost of milk and eggs can be represented as:

Food items = $2 + $3 = $5

Next, we'll calculate the cost of non-food items, which include light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. The total cost of these items is:

Non-food items = $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we can calculate the tax amount as follows:

Tax = 10% of $10 = 0.1 × $10 = $1

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items to obtain the total cost of non-food items with tax:

Non-food items with tax = $10 + $1 = $11

Finally, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax to obtain the total cost:

Total cost = $5 + $11 = $16

The final answer is: $16"
"To determine the profit that Kim will make from his housekeeping business, we need to calculate the total income and total expenses. 

Let's denote the number of clients as $n$. Since Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, we can express the total number of clients as $n = 3 + 5 = 8$. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.

The total number of bottles of bleach needed per week is given by $2n$, and the total number of packs of cloths needed per week is $n$. 

The cost of bleach per week is $2 \times 2n = 4n$, and the cost of cloths per week is $5n$.

The total expenses per week are the sum of the cost of bleach and the cost of cloths, which is $4n + 5n = 9n$.

Given that Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week: $92 - 9n$

Since we know that $n = 8$, we can substitute this value into the expression for profit:

Profit per week: $92 - 9(8) = 92 - 72 = 20$

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we must first calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare and then multiply it by the number of harvests in a year.

Given that there are 100 pineapples per hectare and John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:

100 pineapples/hectare × 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:

1000 pineapples/harvest × 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

Therefore, John can harvest a total of 4000 pineapples within a year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"
"To determine the total number of LEGO pieces Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and sum them together.

Let's denote the number of pieces in the first set as $n_1 = 500$. The second set has three times more pieces than the first set, so the number of pieces in the second set is $n_2 = 3n_1 = 3 \cdot 500 = 1500$. The third set has one-fourth the number of pieces of the first set, so the number of pieces in the third set is $n_3 = \frac{1}{4}n_1 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 500 = 125$.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pieces by summing the number of pieces in each set: $n_{\text{total}} = n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2125}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps, utilizing principles of combinatorics and basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the initial number of bees in the hive as $B$. We are given that 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. This implies that the number of bees remaining in the hive after the first 6 hours is $B - 30$.

In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. Therefore, the number of bees that return in the next 6 hours is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 30 = 15$. The total number of bees in the hive after this period is $B - 30 + 15 = B - 15$.

We are then told that two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees that left the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours. This implies that the number of bees that leave the hive in the next 6 hours is $2 \cdot 30 = 60$. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is $30 + 60 = 90$.

However, we are interested in the number of bees that have not returned yet. We know that 15 bees returned in the previous period, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is $90 - 15 = 75$.

In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. This implies that the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is equal to the number of bees that have not returned yet, which is 75.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of admission for adults is $12 and for children is $10. Given that Brittany's mom purchased one of each, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we can infer that the amount she gave the cashier is the sum of the total cost and the change received.

Let x be the amount given to the cashier. Then, we can express this relationship as:

x = Total cost + Change
x = $22 + $8
x = $30

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"Given the problem, we can establish a relationship between the number of Facebook friends of Charlie, Dorothy, and James. Let's denote the number of friends Dorothy has as ""D"". Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can express this as:

Charlie's friends = 3D

We are given that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3D = 12

To find the value of D, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

D = 12 / 3
D = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine the number of friends James has. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can express this as:

James' friends = 4D
= 4(4)
= 16

Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the outcome of the race between Steve and Tim, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to travel from school to their residence.

First, let's convert the distances to a common unit. Since both distances are given in miles, we can directly use the conversion factor of 5280 feet per mile. 

Steve's distance is 3 miles, so his distance in feet is 3 × 5280 = 15840 feet. His speed is 440 feet per minute.

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 15840 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 36 minutes

Tim's distance is 2 miles, so his distance in feet is 2 × 5280 = 10560 feet. His speed is 264 feet per minute.

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve
Difference in time = 40 - 36
Difference in time = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total revenue generated by Shawnda's bike inflation service, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's consider the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has two tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. Therefore, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * $0.25 = $2.50.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has three tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. Thus, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * $0.25 = $2.25.

Lastly, we'll consider the unicycle tire. A unicycle has one tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. Therefore, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1. The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * $0.25 = $0.25.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"To determine the change Carl receives after purchasing ten packs of cookies, we must first calculate the total cost of the cookies. Given that each pack contains six cookies and each cookie costs $0.10, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Let's denote the number of packs as $n$, the number of cookies per pack as $c$, and the cost per cookie as $p$. We are given that $n = 10$, $c = 6$, and $p = 0.10$.

The total number of cookies is the product of the number of packs and the number of cookies per pack: $n \cdot c = 10 \cdot 6 = 60$ cookies.

The total cost of the cookies is the product of the total number of cookies and the cost per cookie: $60 \cdot 0.10 = 6$ dollars.

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, the change he receives is the difference between the $10 bill and the total cost of the cookies: $10 - 6 = 4$ dollars.

Therefore, the change Carl receives is $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach, utilizing algebraic manipulations to isolate the variable representing the initial number of french fries.

Let's denote the initial number of french fries as $x$. We can then track the number of fries remaining after each event.

Initially, Dave ate 14 french fries, leaving $x - 14$ fries.

The seagull then ate half the amount Dave ate, which is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 14 = 7$ fries. Therefore, the total number of fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is $14 + 7 = 21$. The number of fries remaining is $x - 14 - 21 = x - 35$.

Next, three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they consumed a total of $3 \cdot 3 = 9$ fries. The number of fries remaining after the pigeons ate is $x - 35 - 9 = x - 44$.

A raccoon then stole $\frac{2}{3}$ of the remaining fries, which is $\frac{2}{3}(x - 44)$. The number of fries remaining after the raccoon ate is $x - 44 - \frac{2}{3}(x - 44)$.

We can simplify this expression by first distributing the $\frac{2}{3}$: $x - 44 - \frac{2}{3}x + \frac{88}{3}$. Combining like terms yields $\frac{1}{3}x - \frac{88}{3} + 44$.

Simplifying further, we get $\frac{1}{3}x - \frac{88}{3} + \frac{132}{3} = \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{44}{3}$.

After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. Therefore, we can set up the equation $\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{44}{3} - 1 = 5$.

We can solve for $x$ by first adding 1 to both sides: $\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{44}{3} = 6$.

Next, we multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: $x + 44 = 18$.

Finally, we subtract 44 from both sides to isolate $x$: $x = 18 - 44 = -26$.

However, this solution is not feasible, as the initial number of french fries cannot be negative. Let's re-examine the equation $\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{44}{3} - 1 = 5$.

We can rewrite the equation as $\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{44}{3} = 6$. Multiplying both sides by 3 yields $x + 44 = 18$.

"To determine the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

First, let's calculate the total hours per week. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. This results in a total of 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day for these days. Since there are 3 days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. This results in a total of 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day for these days. Since there are 2 days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is the sum of the hours for both sets of days, which is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. Therefore, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{272}$"
"To determine the total length of the baked goods, we must first convert the lengths of each item to a common unit. Since we are ultimately interested in the length in feet, it is most convenient to convert the lengths of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet.

The length of each roll is 4 inches, and there are 12 inches in a foot. Therefore, the length of each roll in feet is 4/12 = 1/3 feet. The total length of the rolls is then 300 rolls * (1/3 feet/roll) = 100 feet.

The length of each croissant is 6 inches, which is equivalent to 6/12 = 1/2 feet. The total length of the croissants is then 120 croissants * (1/2 feet/croissant) = 60 feet.

The length of each baguette is given as 2 feet, so the total length of the baguettes is 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet.

Now, we can add the total lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes to find the total length of the baked goods:

Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"
"To determine the total number of bananas required for the apes at the zoo, we must first calculate the monthly consumption of each species and then multiply it by 2 to account for the 2-month period.

The monkeys require 200 bananas per month, while the gorillas need 400 bananas per month. The baboons, being a more frugivorous species, consume 100 bananas per month. 

To find the total monthly consumption, we sum the individual requirements: 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since we are interested in the total consumption for a 2-month period, we multiply the monthly consumption by 2: 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper must order 1400 bananas to meet the needs of the apes for 2 months."
"To determine the winner of the contest between Blake and Kelly, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran. 

Blake's distance can be calculated as follows: he runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. Therefore, the total distance Blake ran is $2 \times 100 \times 15 = 3000$ yards.

Kelly's distance can be calculated as follows: she runs back and forth once, which is $2 \times 100 = 200$ yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is $2 \times 40 = 80$ yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is $34 \times 80 = 2720$ yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is $2720 + 200 = 2920$ yards.

Since $3000 > 2920$, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: $3000 - 2920 = 80$ yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the total amount Raphael spent on school supplies, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. Specifically, we will utilize the distributive property of multiplication over addition to calculate the total cost.

First, we calculate the cost of the pens: 4 pens at $1.5 each can be expressed as 4 × $1.5. Using the distributive property, we can rewrite this as (4 × $1) + (4 × $0.5). This simplifies to $4 + $2, which equals $6.

Next, we calculate the cost of the notebooks: 2 notebooks at $4 each can be expressed as 2 × $4. This simplifies to $8.

Finally, we add the cost of the pens, the cost of the notebooks, and the cost of the bond paper: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $34 on school supplies.

The final answer is: $34"
"To determine the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond, we must consider the changes in tadpole population over time. Initially, Finn observes 11 tadpoles. Subsequently, 6 tadpoles emerge from under a lily pad, increasing the total count to 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. However, 2 tadpoles then hide under a rock, rendering them invisible to Finn. To calculate the updated number of tadpoles Finn can see, we subtract the 2 tadpoles that hid: 17 - 2 = 15.

"To determine the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the depth of the water on Tuesday. Given that the tank had 7 feet more water on Tuesday than on Monday, we can express this as an increase in the depth of the water.

Let's denote the depth of the water on Monday as $M$ and the depth of the water on Tuesday as $T$. We are given that $M = 17$ feet. The increase in water depth from Monday to Tuesday is 7 feet, so we can express this as $T = M + 7$. Substituting the value of $M$, we get $T = 17 + 7 = 24$ feet.

Now, we need to find the depth of the water on Wednesday, denoted as $W$. We are given that the depth of the water on Wednesday is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Mathematically, this can be expressed as $W = \frac{2}{3}T$. Substituting the value of $T$, we get $W = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{48}{3} = 16$ feet.

Therefore, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we can start by calculating the number of fish caught by each individual.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. The total number of fish caught by Anakin can be calculated as follows:

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish)
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3
Total fish caught by Anakin = 19

Now, let's calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin. We know that Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Similarly, Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which is 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Additionally, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish)
Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5
Total fish caught by Locsin = 13

To find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin, we can add the number of fish caught by each individual:

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we can model the price increase as an exponential function. The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20, and the price increases by 20% every two months.

Let's denote the initial price as P0 = $20 and the monthly increase rate as r = 0.20. Since the price increases every two months, we can express the price at any time t (in months) as:

P(t) = P0 \* (1 + r)^t/2

We want to find the price after 36 months, so we can plug in t = 36 into the equation:

P(36) = 20 \* (1 + 0.20)^(36/2)
= 20 \* (1.20)^18

Using a calculator to evaluate the expression, we get:

P(36) ≈ 20 \* 2.158
≈ 43.16

However, this is not the final answer, as we need to account for the 20% increase every two months for 36 months. To do this, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where A is the amount after n periods, P is the principal amount (initial price), r is the interest rate (monthly increase rate), and n is the number of periods.

In this case, we have:

A = 20(1 + 0.20)^18
= 20(1.20)^18
≈ 43.16

However, this is still not the correct answer, as we need to account for the 20% increase every two months for 36 months. To do this, we can use the formula for compound interest with a period of 2 months:

"To determine the total worth of the toys in the room, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then sum them together.

Given that the cost of one action figure is $5, we can establish the cost of the other toys relative to this value. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so its cost is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of toy:
- 5 red cars: 5 * $4 = $20
- 3 action figures: 3 * $5 = $15
- 1 doll: $15

The total worth of all the toys is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the financial implications of Jackie's decision to hire an accountant or do her taxes herself, we need to consider the opportunity cost of her time. If she chooses to do the taxes herself, she will forego 3 hours of freelance work, resulting in a loss of income.

The opportunity cost of her time can be calculated as follows:

Opportunity Cost = 3 hours * $35/hour
= $105

This represents the income she would have earned if she had not spent the time doing her taxes. On the other hand, hiring an accountant would cost her $90.

To find the difference in her financial outcome, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the opportunity cost of her time:

Difference = Opportunity Cost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories and subtract this from her budget.

The total cost of the computer accessories can be calculated as follows:

Computer: €1090
Scanner: €157
CD burner: €74
Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1323

Now, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:

€1500 - €1323 = €177

Therefore, Elvira will have €177 left for her clothing."
"To determine the number of times Sandra must babysit to obtain the required number of eggs, we need to calculate the total number of eggs needed for the Spanish flans and then divide that by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job.

First, we calculate the total number of eggs required: 3 eggs per Spanish flan * 15 Spanish flans = 3 * 15 = 45 eggs.

Next, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs received per babysitting job: 45 eggs / 9 eggs per babysitting job = 5.

Therefore, Sandra must babysit 5 times to obtain the required number of eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic equations. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, which can be represented as:

S = 2B

where S is Seth's current age and B is Brooke's current age.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be represented as:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Given that Ethel possesses $8, we can express Jimmy's wealth as a function of Ethel's wealth. Let's denote Ethel's wealth as E and Jimmy's wealth as J. We are given that J = 2E + 2, where 2E represents twice the amount of money Ethel has, and the additional $2 is the difference in their wealth.

Substituting the value of E as $8 into the equation, we get J = 2(8) + 2. 

To calculate Jimmy's wealth, we first multiply 2 by 8, which equals 16. Then, we add 2 to this result, yielding J = 16 + 2 = 18.

Therefore, Jimmy's wealth is $18."
"To determine the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the average daily miles walked and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is a total of 5 days. On the weekends, he walks 10 miles a day for 2 days. 

The total miles walked from Monday to Friday can be calculated as 20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles. The total miles walked on Saturday and Sunday is 10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles.

To find the average daily miles walked, we add the total miles walked in the week and divide by the number of days: (100 miles + 20 miles) / 7 days = 120 miles / 7 days = 17.14 miles/day (approximately).

However, since the question asks for the total miles walked in a week, we can simply add the miles walked from Monday to Friday and the miles walked on Saturday and Sunday: 100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles.

Therefore, the total miles Pancho walks in a week is 120 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we must first calculate the individual costs of the hat, jacket, and pants. 

The cost of the hat is a given, $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, which can be expressed as 3 \* $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each uniform by summing the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To determine the total number of legs observed by Jake, we can calculate the number of legs for each group of arthropods and then sum these values.

First, we calculate the total number of legs for the spiders, which are arachnids belonging to the order Araneomorphae. Since each spider has 8 legs, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

Spiders: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs

Next, we calculate the total number of legs for the insects, which are a diverse group of invertebrates belonging to the class Insecta. Assuming that the insects observed are representative of the general insect fauna, we can estimate the total number of legs as follows:

Insects: 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs

Lastly, we consider the rare mutant invertebrates, which are likely to be arthropods but may not conform to the typical morphology of insects or arachnids. For the sake of this calculation, we will assume that these invertebrates have 10 legs each, although this may not be a realistic assumption in a real-world scenario.

Mutant invertebrates: 3 invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs

To find the total number of legs observed by Jake, we sum the number of legs for each group:

Total legs = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210

Therefore, the total number of legs observed by Jake is 1210."
"To determine the total age of the four birds, we can establish a series of relationships between their ages. Let's denote the age of Sally Two as $S_2$, the age of Granny Red as $G$, and the age of Sally Four as $S_4$. We are given that Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. Therefore, $S_4 = S_{32} = 8$.

We are also given that Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so $G = 2S_4 = 2(8) = 16$.

Furthermore, we know that Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so $S_2 = G + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19$.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages together: $S_2 + G + S_4 + S_{32} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{51}$"
"To determine the total annual payment, we need to calculate the increased minimum payment for each debt and then sum these amounts. 

The increased minimum payment for each debt can be calculated by multiplying the minimum payment by 1.5. 

- Student loans: $300 × 1.5 = $450
- Credit card: $200 × 1.5 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 × 1.5 = $750

Now, we sum the increased minimum payments to find the total monthly payment:
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

To find the total annual payment, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:
$1500 × 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To determine the total time required for Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we must first calculate the time spent on each task individually and then sum them.

The time to peel one potato is given as 1.5 minutes. Since the potatoes are of similar size, we can assume a constant peeling time. Therefore, the total time to peel all 60 potatoes is:

$$\text{Time to peel all potatoes} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ minutes}$$

The time to cut one potato is given as 5 seconds, which is equivalent to 5/60 minutes. Therefore, the total time to cut all 60 potatoes is:

$$\text{Time to cut all potatoes} = 60 \times \frac{5}{60} = 5 \text{ minutes}$$

To find the total time required for both tasks, we add the time to peel and cut all potatoes:

$$\text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel all potatoes} + \text{Time to cut all potatoes} = 90 + 5 = 95 \text{ minutes}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{95}$"
"To determine the amount spent on lemons, we need to first calculate the total revenue generated from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's denote the number of gallons sold as $g$. The revenue per gallon is $10, and the cost of sugar per gallon is $2. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3. The profit made is $25.

The total revenue is given by the product of the revenue per gallon and the number of gallons sold:
$R = 10g$

The total cost is the sum of the cost of lemons and the cost of sugar, both of which are multiplied by the number of gallons sold:
$C = 3g + 2g = 5g$

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:
$P = R - C = 10g - 5g = 5g$

We are given that the profit is $25, so we can set up the equation:
$5g = 25$

Solving for $g$, we get:
$g = \frac{25}{5} = 5$

Now that we know the number of gallons sold, we can find the cost of lemons:
$C_{\text{lemons}} = 3g = 3(5) = 15$

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to calculate the total number of Chinese participants. Given that the total number of participants is 240 and the number of Japanese participants is 80, we can calculate the number of Chinese participants as follows:

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Since the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the amount of money Zaid has left after all expenses and donations, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, let's calculate the amount spent on rent: $\frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 600$. 

Next, we calculate the amount spent on car fuel: $\frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000$.

Now, we can find the remaining amount after rent and car fuel: $6000 - 600 - 2000 = 3400$.

Then, we calculate the amount donated to charity: $\frac{1}{2} \times 3400 = 1700$.

After the donation, the remaining amount is: $3400 - 1700 = 1700$.

Next, we calculate the total amount given to his daughter and wife: $200 + 700 = 900$.

Finally, we can find the final remaining amount: $1700 - 900 = 800$.

The final answer is: $800"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a linear relationship between the number of crabs each individual possesses. Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as B, Monic as M, and Rani as R. We are given that B = 40, M = B - 4, and R = M + 10.

Substituting the value of B into the equation for M, we get M = 40 - 4 = 36. Then, substituting the value of M into the equation for R, we get R = 36 + 10 = 46.

To find the total number of crabs, we can sum the number of crabs each person has: B + M + R = 40 + 36 + 46.

The total number of crabs is therefore 40 + 36 + 46 = 122.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"To determine Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks, we can apply the concept of linear algebra and arithmetic operations. Specifically, we will utilize the distributive property of multiplication over addition to calculate his total earnings.

Let's denote Lloyd's hourly wage as $10 and the number of hours he tutored in the first and second weeks as 5 and 8, respectively. We can express his earnings for each week as a product of his hourly wage and the number of hours tutored:

Earnings for the first week = 5 hours * $10/hour = $50
Earnings for the second week = 8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we can add his earnings for the first and second weeks together using the commutative and associative properties of addition:

Total earnings = Earnings for the first week + Earnings for the second week
= $50 + $80
= $130

Therefore, Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks are $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"Given that the winner of the class representative election secured 3/4 of the total votes, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

Let's denote the total number of students who voted as $T$. We are given that $T = 80$. The number of votes the winner received is then $3/4 \cdot T = 3/4 \cdot 80 = 60$.

To find the number of votes the loser received, we subtract the number of votes the winner received from the total number of votes:

Votes received by the loser $= T - \text{Votes received by the winner} = 80 - 60 = 20$.

Therefore, the number of votes the loser received is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of red roses that Fred must deliver to keep Sandra's business, we can establish a relationship between the quantities of the different flowers ordered. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. We are given that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and there are 200 pink calla lilies. This can be expressed as:

5x = 200

To find the value of 'x', we can solve for it by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

$$
\begin{aligned}
5x &= 200 \\
\frac{5x}{5} &= \frac{200}{5} \\
x &= 40
\end{aligned}
$$

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We are given that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. This can be expressed as:

y = 4x

Substituting the value of 'x' we found earlier, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y &= 4x \\
y &= 4(40) \\
y &= 160
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"Let's analyze the given information:

Let J represent Jean's current age, and M represent Mark's current age. We are given the following information:

1. J = M + 2 (Jean is two years older than Mark)
2. Two years ago, M - 2 = (1/2)(J - 2) + 5 (Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age)

We are also given that J = 30.

Substituting J = 30 into equation (2), we get:
M - 2 = (1/2)(30 - 2) + 5
M - 2 = (1/2)(28) + 5
M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19
M = 21

Now, we can find Jean's age using equation (1):
J = M + 2
J = 21 + 2
J = 23

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

The final answer is: 23"
"Given the scenario of a 4x400 meter relay, where each team consists of four members, we can calculate the total time for each team by summing the individual times for each runner.

For the well-rounded team, each member completes their 400 meter leg in 55 seconds. Therefore, the total time for the well-rounded team is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner completes their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Thus, the second runner completes their leg in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

To determine the difference in time between the two teams, we subtract the total time of the less well-rounded team from the total time of the well-rounded team: 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

Therefore, the faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To determine the likelihood of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 versus rolling two even numbers in a row, we must first calculate the probabilities associated with each event.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die can be calculated as follows:

P(X > 3) = P(4) + P(5) + P(6)
           = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6
           = 3/6
           = 1/2

This is equivalent to a 50% chance.

Next, we calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. Since the events are independent, we multiply the probabilities of each event:

P(2) = 1/6
P(4) = 1/6
P(6) = 1/6

P(2 and 2) = P(2) * P(2) = (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36
P(2 and 4) = P(2) * P(4) = (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36
P(2 and 6) = P(2) * P(6) = (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36
P(4 and 2) = P(4) * P(2) = (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36
P(4 and 4) = P(4) * P(4) = (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36
P(4 and 6) = P(4) * P(6) = (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36
P(6 and 2) = P(6) * P(2) = (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36
P(6 and 4) = P(6) * P(4) = (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36
P(6 and 6) = P(6) * P(6) = (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36

There are 9 favorable outcomes for rolling two even numbers in a row, so the probability is:

P(two even numbers in a row) = 9/36 = 1/4

Now, we can find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row:

P(X > 3) - P(two even numbers in a row) = 1/2 - 1/4
                                         = 1/4

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(1/4) * 100 = 25%

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Given that Jenna's apple-picking abilities are directly proportional to her mother's, we can establish a ratio of their apple-picking efficiency. If her mother picked 20 apples, we can infer that Jenna picked half of that amount, which is a direct proportion of their combined effort.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Let J be the number of apples Jenna picked and M be the number of apples her mother picked. We know that J = 0.5M, since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother.

Given M = 20, we can substitute this value into the equation to find J:

J = 0.5M
J = 0.5(20)
J = 10

Therefore, Jenna picked 10 apples. To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mother picked:

Total apples = J + M
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"Given the scenario, we can approach this problem by first determining the total number of straw pieces allocated to the hamsters and rabbits. The hamsters are kept in 10 cages, with each hamster receiving 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of straw pieces allocated to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits are allocated 20 pieces of straw. Consequently, the total number of straw pieces allocated to the hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 70 pieces are allocated to the hamsters and rabbits, the remaining straw pieces are allocated to the rats. Therefore, the number of straw pieces allocated to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, with each rat receiving 6 pieces of straw. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. The total number of rats in 3 cages is then 3r.

The total number of straw pieces allocated to the rats is 90, and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r, we can set up the equation 3r = 15. Solving for 'r', we get r = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total amount Mandy should pay, we can utilize the formula for compound interest, which is A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the amount after n periods, P is the principal amount, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of periods.

Given that the principal amount P is $100, the monthly interest rate r is 2% or 0.02, and the number of periods n is 3, we can calculate the total amount A as follows:

A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3
  = 100(1.02)^3
  = 100(1.061208)
  = 106.1208

Therefore, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we can apply the principles of cost accounting and profit maximization. Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'.

The total cost of purchasing the bags is $20x, as each bag is acquired at a rate of $20. The transportation cost per bag is $2, resulting in a total transportation cost of $2x.

The total cost is therefore $20x + $2x = $22x.

The revenue generated from selling the bags is $30x, as each bag is sold at a rate of $30.

The profit, which is the difference between revenue and cost, is given as $400. We can express this as an equation:

$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$8x = $400

Dividing both sides by 8, we obtain:

$$\frac{8x}{8} = \frac{400}{8}$$

x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total cost incurred by the three friends, we must first calculate the individual components of their expenses. The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the tickets, which can be expressed as $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75. The cost of the rides is $33 per ride, and since they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by summing the individual components: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

To find the amount each friend paid, we divide the total cost by the number of friends, which is 3. Therefore, each friend paid $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is $34."
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we can utilize the concept of unit rates and multiplication. Given that John collects 2 peaches per minute, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he collects peaches.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, and John collects peaches for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of minutes he collects peaches is 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total number of peaches collected by multiplying the number of peaches per minute by the total minutes:

2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches.

The final answer is: 360"
"To determine the daily insect consumption of a flock of ten ducks, we must first consider their weekly requirements. The recommended weekly insect intake for a single duck is 3.5 pounds. Given that there are ten ducks in the flock, we can calculate the total weekly insect consumption as follows:

Total weekly insect consumption = 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the daily insect consumption by dividing the total weekly consumption by 7:

Daily insect consumption = 35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks requires 5 pounds of insects per day to meet their nutritional needs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to consider the net change in the number of trees over this period. Given that Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, the net change in the number of trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees. Therefore, the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years is 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net change) = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we can calculate 30% of 130 as 0.3 * 130 = 39.

Consequently, the number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final numerical answer is: 91"
"To determine the difference between the number of pink and white plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard at noon on Sunday, we need to analyze the events that occurred over the weekend.

Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos. On Saturday, the neighbors removed one third of the flamingos, which is equivalent to 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. These 6 flamingos were then painted white and returned to the yard. Consequently, the number of pink flamingos remaining is 18 - 6 = 12.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection, resulting in a total of 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The number of white flamingos remains constant at 6, as the neighbors only added pink flamingos on Sunday.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final numerical answer is: 24"
"Given that Violetta has $20 to spend on crayons and each crayon costs $2, we can calculate the total number of crayons she can purchase as follows:

Let's denote the number of crayons as 'n'. Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she will buy 2 crayons of each color. Therefore, the total number of crayons she can buy is 2n.

The total cost of the crayons is equal to the number of crayons multiplied by the cost of one crayon, which is $2. Since Violetta has $20, we can set up the following equation:

2n = 20

To find the value of 'n', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

n = 20 / 2
n = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she will buy 2 crayons of each color. Therefore, the total number of crayons she can buy is 2n = 2(10) = 20. However, this is not possible since she only has $20 and each crayon costs $2. This means she cannot buy 20 crayons.

"Given the problem, we can establish a relationship between the cost of a pen, a pencil, and an eraser. Let's denote the cost of a pen as P, the cost of a pencil as p, and the cost of an eraser as e.

We are given that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, so we can express this relationship as P = p + e. Additionally, we know the cost of a pencil (p) is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser (e) is $0.30.

Substituting the given values into the equation, we get P = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. To do this, we can multiply the cost of a single pen (P) by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = P * 8 = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine the amount of carrots that will not be used, we can apply a simple linear algebra approach. Let's denote the initial amount of carrots as C and the number of restaurants as R. Each restaurant receives a fixed quantity of carrots, denoted as Q.

Given that C = 200 pounds and R = 40 restaurants, with each restaurant receiving Q = 2 pounds of carrots, we can calculate the total amount of carrots distributed as:

Total distributed = Q * R = 2 * 40 = 80 pounds

To find the amount of carrots that will not be used, we subtract the total distributed from the initial amount:

Carrots not used = C - Total distributed = 200 - 80 = 120 pounds

Therefore, the amount of carrots that will not be used is 120 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the number of children in the city of Soda, we can utilize a simple demographic analysis. Given that the total population of Soda is 23,786 inhabitants, comprising 8,417 men and 9,092 women, we can calculate the number of children by subtracting the sum of the male and female populations from the total population.

Let's denote the total population as P, the number of men as M, the number of women as W, and the number of children as C. We can express this relationship as:

C = P - (M + W)

Substituting the given values, we have:

C = 23,786 - (8,417 + 9,092)
C = 23,786 - 17,509
C = 6,277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6,277.

The final answer is: 6277"
"To determine the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine possesses, we can break down the problem into manageable components. Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number of cards, which can be expressed as 3 × 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month, which can be calculated as 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months, which can be expressed as 2 × (60 + 40) = 2 × 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards by adding the cards from each month and the initial number: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

The final numerical answer is: 320"
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we can break down the problem into manageable components. Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher as x. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we have x = 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Given that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, the total amount he earns from Publisher A is 5x = 5 * 500 = 2500 cents. 

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, the total amount Mark earns from Publisher B is 10x = 10 * 500 = 5000 cents.

To find Mark's total weekly earnings, we add the amounts earned from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"
"To determine the total amount of water Baldur receives daily, we must first calculate the total number of pails he collects in a 24-hour period. Given that he acquires 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon, we can express this as a mathematical expression:

Total pails = 5 (morning pails) + 6 (afternoon pails)

Total pails = 5 + 6
Total pails = 11

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, we can calculate the total amount of water collected by multiplying the total number of pails by the volume of each pail:

Total water (liters) = Total pails * Volume per pail
Total water (liters) = 11 * 5
Total water (liters) = 55

Therefore, Baldur receives a total of 55 liters of water every day.

The final answer is: 55"
"To determine the total amount John made that year, we need to consider the one-time monetary reward of $5000 and the 5% raise in salary. 

First, let's calculate the 5% raise:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.05 \times 2000 = 100 \]
New salary = 2000 + 100 = 2100

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will have the new salary for all 52 weeks of the year. 

Total amount made that year = New salary \* Number of weeks
= 2100 \* 52
= 109200

However, we also need to consider the one-time monetary reward of $5000. Therefore, the total amount John made that year is the sum of his new salary for 52 weeks and the one-time reward:
Total amount made that year = (New salary \* Number of weeks) + One-time reward
= 109200 + 5000
= 114200

The total amount John made that year is $114200."
"To determine the total number of barrels of wine produced per year on Josie's 10-acre farm, we must first calculate the total tons of grapes produced annually. Given that each acre yields 5 tons of grapes per year, we can compute this as follows:

Total tons of grapes per year = Number of acres × Tons of grapes per acre
= 10 acres × 5 tons/acre
= 50 tons

Next, we need to convert the total tons of grapes into barrels of wine, considering that each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine. This can be calculated as:

Total barrels of wine per year = Total tons of grapes per year × Barrels of wine per ton
= 50 tons × 2 barrels/ton
= 100 barrels

Therefore, Josie's 10-acre farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we can break down the problem into three distinct components: the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish.

First, let's consider the slices used for sandwiches. Since Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week, we can calculate the total number of slices used as follows:

Let S represent the number of slices used per sandwich. Then, the total number of slices used for sandwiches is given by the product of the number of days (7) and the number of slices per sandwich (S):

Total slices for sandwiches = 7S

We are given that Carl used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, so we can substitute S = 2 into the equation:

Total slices for sandwiches = 7(2) = 14

Next, let's consider the slices used for omelets. We are told that Carl used one more slice per omelet than per sandwich, so the number of slices per omelet is S + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3. Since Carl ate omelets for 3 days, the total number of slices used for omelets is given by the product of the number of days (3) and the number of slices per omelet (3):

Total slices for omelets = 3(3) = 9

Finally, we are given that Carl used 8 slices of cheese in the macaroni and cheese dish.

To find the total number of slices of cheese used, we can add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish:

Total slices = Total slices for sandwiches + Total slices for omelets + Total slices for macaroni and cheese
= 14 + 9 + 8
= 31

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To determine the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of blue and red pens she purchased and add them to her initial number of pens.

Let's denote the number of green pens as $G$, the number of yellow pens as $Y$, the number of blue pens as $B$, and the number of red pens as $R$. We are given that $G = 22$ and $Y = 10$. Janet purchased 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so the total number of blue pens she bought is $B = 6 \times 9 = 54$. Similarly, she purchased 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so the total number of red pens she bought is $R = 2 \times 6 = 12$.

The total number of new pens she bought is $B + R = 54 + 12 = 66$.

Janet initially had $G + Y = 22 + 10 = 32$ pens.

Now, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens she bought: $G + Y + B + R = 32 + 66 = 98$ pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the concept of averages. Given that Mr. Bert allows students to exclude the lowest score from the average each semester, we can calculate the total score required for the semester by multiplying the desired average by the number of tests.

Let's denote the desired average as A = 93 and the number of tests as n = 6. The total score required for the semester is given by:

T = A * n
= 93 * 6
= 558

Next, we need to find the total score of the first five tests. We can add up the scores of the first five tests:

T5 = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86
= 338

Since Brinley can exclude the lowest score from the average, we need to find the total score of the remaining four tests. We subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests:

T4 = T5 - min(T5)
= 338 - 71
= 267

Now, we can find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test by subtracting the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score required for the semester:

T6 = T - T4
= 558 - 267
= 291

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 291 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

The final answer is: $\boxed{291}$"
"To determine the total distance traveled by Michael, we can break down his cycling activities into two distinct periods.

During the initial four weeks, Michael cycled 25 kilometers per session, 5 times a week. This can be represented as a simple multiplication problem:

25 km/session * 5 sessions/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 km

This yields a total distance of 500 kilometers for the first period.

Subsequently, Michael altered his cycling routine, opting to ride 60 kilometers per session, 2 times a week, for a duration of 3 weeks. This can be calculated as follows:

60 km/session * 2 sessions/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 km

To obtain the total distance traveled, we sum the distances from both periods:

500 km + 360 km = 860 km

Therefore, the total distance traveled by Michael is 860 kilometers."
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we must first calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately, then sum them.

The weight of the chocolate bars can be calculated as follows:

Weight of chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars × Weight of each chocolate bar
= 25 × 40g
= 25 × 40
= 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple can be calculated as follows:

Weight of each candied apple = Weight of each chocolate bar / 2
= 40g / 2
= 20g

The weight of the candied apples can be calculated as follows:

Weight of candied apples = Number of candied apples × Weight of each candied apple
= 80 × 20g
= 80 × 20
= 1600g

The total weight of the bag of candy is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples:

Total weight of the bag of candy = Weight of chocolate bars + Weight of candied apples
= 1000g + 1600g
= 2600g

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose purchased over the three-day period, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

Let's denote the number of cakes she bought on Monday as M, Tuesday as T, and Wednesday as W. We are given that M = 4. 

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, so T = 3M = 3(4) = 12.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, so W = 5T = 5(12) = 60.

To find the total number of cakes she bought, we can simply add the number of cakes she bought each day: M + T + W = 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To determine the cost of each cup, we can establish a relationship between the cost of the cups and the plates. Let's denote the cost of each cup as $c. We are given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is sold at $6000 each.

The total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000. Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups. To find the cost of each cup, we can set up the equation:

20 * 12 * c = 34,800

Solving for c, we get:

c = 34,800 / (20 * 12)
c = 34,800 / 240
c = 145

Therefore, the cost of each cup is $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"To determine the number of times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to earn and subtract the amount she already has.

Let's denote the total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes as C, the amount Sara already has as A, the amount she earns from babysitting as B, and the amount she earns from mowing the lawn as M. We also need to denote the number of times she mows the lawn as n.

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is C = $30 + 2 * $20 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has A = $10.

She earns B = $5 each time she babysits and M = $4 each time she mows the lawn.

We can express the total amount she needs to earn as C - A = $70 - $10 = $60.

The amount she earns from babysitting is 4 * B = 4 * $5 = $20.

The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is (C - A) - 4 * B = $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns M = $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can express the number of times she needs to mow the lawn as n = (C - A - 4 * B) / M = ($60 - $20) / $4 = $40 / $4 = 10.

Therefore, the number of times Sara must mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We are given that W = R + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is 42, with each red chicken producing 3 eggs and each white chicken producing 5 eggs. This can be represented by the equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

Therefore, the number of red chickens is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the time Gary spends walking around the edge of the local park, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(l + w)
P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a constant speed of 3 miles/hour, we can calculate the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the edge of the local park.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. According to the problem statement, the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, which can be expressed as x + 50. The total number of customers by the third day is given as 500.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of customers by the third day as the sum of the customers on the first two days and the customers on the third day:

x + (x + 50) + y = 500

However, we are tasked with finding the number of customers on the third day, denoted as y. To isolate y, we can first combine like terms on the left-hand side of the equation:

2x + 50 + y = 500

Next, we can subtract 50 from both sides of the equation to isolate the terms involving x:

2x + y = 450

Now, we need to find the value of x, which represents the number of customers on the first day. We know that the total number of customers by the third day is 500, and the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 50) = 500 - y

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 50 = 500 - y

Substituting the expression for y from the previous equation (2x + y = 450), we get:

2x + 50 = 500 - (2x + 50)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 50 = 500 - 2x - 50

Combine like terms:

4x = 500

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 125

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into the equation 2x + y = 450 to find the value of y:

2(125) + y = 450

Simplifying the equation, we get:

250 + y = 450

Subtract 250 from both sides:

y = 200

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 200.

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's analyze the problem using a mathematical model. We can denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as $x$ gallons and the initial amount of water in the big pool as $2x$ gallons, since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago.

The rate at which the water is leaking from both pools is 4 gallons/minute. Since 4 minutes have passed, the total amount of water leaked from both pools is $4 \cdot 4 = 16$ gallons.

Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as $S$ and the current amount of water in the big pool as $B$. We can express the current amount of water in each pool as follows:

$$S = x - 4$$
$$B = 2x - 4$$

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

$$B = 4S$$

Substituting the expressions for $B$ and $S$, we get:

$$2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)$$

Simplifying the equation:

$$2x - 4 = 4x - 16$$

Subtracting $2x$ from both sides:

$$-4 = 2x - 16$$

Adding 16 to both sides:

$$12 = 2x$$

Dividing both sides by 2:

$$6 = x$$

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. The amount of water in the small pool now is $S = x - 4 = 6 - 4 = 2$ gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of hours Lori needs to work to purchase the shoes and the belt, we must first calculate the total cost of the items she wishes to acquire.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the cost of the belt, which can be expressed as:

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Next, we need to divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage to find the number of hours she must work to earn the required amount.

Let's denote Lori's hourly wage as w. Then, the number of hours she needs to work, denoted as h, can be calculated as:

h = Total cost / w
h = $352.00 / $8.00
h = 44

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn the required amount to purchase the shoes and the belt."
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay in monthly installments and then subtract that from the initial amount borrowed plus the additional 10% interest.

Let's denote the initial amount borrowed as $P = $2000 and the monthly payment as $M = $165. The total amount to be paid in 12 months is given by the formula for the future value of an annuity:

FV = M * [(1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r]

where FV is the future value, M is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments.

However, since Janeth is paying the interest in addition to the principal, we need to calculate the total amount to be paid, which includes the principal and the interest. The interest rate is 10% per annum, so the monthly interest rate is r = 0.10/12 = 0.008333.

The total amount to be paid is the sum of the principal and the interest, which is $2000 + ($2000 * 0.10) = $2200.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months using the formula for the future value of an annuity:

FV = $165 * [(1 - (1 + 0.008333)^(-12)) / 0.008333]
FV ≈ $1980.19

Now, let's calculate the remaining balance:
Total amount to be paid: $2200
Amount paid in 12 months: $1980.19
Remaining balance: $2200 - $1980.19 ≈ $219.81

The final answer is: $219.81"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. Given that there are 4 roses in the vase and 7 more dahlias than roses, we can express the number of dahlias as 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we can simply add the number of roses and dahlias: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15.

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"Given that Harriet's current age is 21 years, we can deduce the ages of the other two individuals using the provided relationships. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as 2 * 21 = 42 years. Similarly, Adrian's age is three times that of Harriet, which yields 3 * 21 = 63 years.

To determine the average age of the three in three years, we first need to calculate their ages at that point in time. Adding 3 years to each of their current ages, we obtain:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

Now, we can calculate the average age by summing their ages and dividing by 3:
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

The final numerical answer is: 45"
"To determine the number of points Jojo scored, we can utilize a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the points scored by Jojo as $J$, Naomi as $N$, Yuri as $Y$, and Brianna as $B$. We are given the following equations:

1. $N = 68$
2. $Y = \frac{1}{2}N + 10$
3. $B = N + 17$
4. $N + Y + B + J = 251$

Substituting the first three equations into the fourth equation, we get:

$68 + \left(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 68 + 10\right) + \left(68 + 17\right) + J = 251$

Simplifying the equation, we have:

$68 + 34 + 10 + 85 + J = 251$

Combine like terms:

$197 + J = 251$

Subtract 197 from both sides:

$J = 54$

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the total time spent by Carmen on these puzzles, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. Specifically, we will utilize the distributive property of multiplication over addition to calculate the total time.

Let's denote the time spent on crossword puzzles as C and the time spent on sudoku puzzles as S. We are given that C = 10 minutes and S = 5 minutes. Additionally, we know that Carmen solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 sudoku puzzles.

The total time spent on crossword puzzles can be calculated as 3C, and the total time spent on sudoku puzzles can be calculated as 8S. Therefore, the total time spent is the sum of these two quantities:

Total time = 3C + 8S
= 3(10) + 8(5)
= 30 + 40
= 70 minutes

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the current water level in the tank, we first need to calculate the amount of water remaining after Celine used 90 liters for her garden. This can be done by subtracting the amount used from the initial tank capacity.

Let's denote the initial tank capacity as $C = 120$ liters and the amount used as $U = 90$ liters. The remaining water in the tank is then given by:

$R = C - U = 120 - 90 = 30$ liters

Next, we are told that Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. This means the collected rainwater is $2R = 2 \times 30 = 60$ liters.

To find the total amount of water in the tank now, we add the remaining water and the collected rainwater:

$T = R + 2R = 30 + 60 = 90$ liters

Therefore, the current water level in the tank is 90 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the total number of flowers planted by Andy, we need to calculate the sum of geraniums and petunias. 

Let's denote the number of geraniums as G and the number of petunias as P. We are given that G = 90 and P = G - 40. 

Substituting the value of G into the equation for P, we get P = 90 - 40 = 50.

Now, we can calculate the total number of flowers by adding G and P: G + P = 90 + 50 = 140.

Therefore, the total number of flowers planted by Andy is 140.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we can calculate the amount spent in the second year by taking a third of the initial expenditure.

The initial expenditure on advertising for the first year is $15,000. To find a third of this amount, we can use the following calculation:

$$\frac{1}{3} \times 15,000 = \frac{15,000}{3} = 5,000$$

Therefore, the company spent $5,000 on advertising in the second year.

To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we can add the expenditures for both years:

$$15,000 + 5,000 = 20,000$$

The total amount spent on advertising for the two years is $20,000.

The final answer is: $20,000"
"To determine the total cost of the rentals, we can apply the concept of linear functions to model the cost of each rental. Let's denote the hourly cost of the canoe as $30 and the hourly cost of the banana boat raft as $18. The time Carlos uses the canoe is 3 hours, and the time Benji uses the banana boat raft is 5 hours.

The cost function for Carlos can be represented as C(t) = 30t, where t is the time in hours. Substituting t = 3, we get C(3) = 30(3) = $90.

Similarly, the cost function for Benji can be represented as B(t) = 18t, where t is the time in hours. Substituting t = 5, we get B(5) = 18(5) = $90.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of Carlos' canoe rental to the cost of Benji's banana boat raft rental: Total Cost = C(3) + B(5) = 90 + 90 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To determine the total duration of Andrew's trip, we need to consider the time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and the time it takes to return from Rochester to New Jersey by car.

Given that it takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester, we can infer that the return trip by car will take half the time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 days.

Therefore, the total duration of the trip is the sum of the time spent traveling to Rochester by bus and the time spent returning by car, which is 6 + 3 = 9 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the probability of selecting a water-type Pokémon card from James' collection, we must first calculate the updated number of cards after the specified transactions.

Initially, James has 30 fire-type, 20 grass-type, and 40 water-type cards, resulting in a total of 90 cards.

After losing 8 water-type cards, the number of water-type cards decreases to 40 - 8 = 32, and the total number of cards becomes 90 - 8 = 82.

Subsequently, after purchasing 14 grass-type cards, the number of grass-type cards increases to 20 + 14 = 34, and the total number of cards becomes 82 + 14 = 96.

Now, we can calculate the probability of selecting a water-type card using the formula:

P(Water-type) = (Number of water-type cards / Total number of cards) × 100

P(Water-type) = (32 / 96) × 100

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 16:

P(Water-type) = (2 / 6) × 100

P(Water-type) = (1 / 3) × 100

P(Water-type) = 33.333...

Rounded to the nearest integer, the probability of selecting a water-type card is 33%.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: $\boxed{33}$"
"To determine the amount Chad still owes, we must calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50.  Chad also selects extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which totals 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.  The total cost of the extra items is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.

The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.  Chad upgrades his meal for an additional $3.00, resulting in a new total of $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

To find the amount Chad still owes, we subtract the gift card value from the total cost: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To determine the time required to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place pieces. 

Let's denote Kalinda's rate as $K$ and her mom's rate as $M$. We are given that Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, so $K = 4$ pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, so $M = \frac{1}{2}K = \frac{1}{2}(4) = 2$ pieces per minute.

The combined rate at which they can place pieces is the sum of their individual rates, which is $K + M = 4 + 2 = 6$ pieces per minute.

To find the time required to complete the puzzle, we can use the formula:

$$t = \frac{N}{r}$$

where $t$ is the time in minutes, $N$ is the total number of pieces, and $r$ is the combined rate.

Plugging in the values, we get:

$$t = \frac{360}{6} = 60 \text{ minutes}$$

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

$$t = \frac{60}{60} = 1 \text{ hour}$$

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

Initially, the watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. This can be calculated as follows:

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36 watermelons.

Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining after two months is:

120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. This can be calculated as follows:

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63 watermelons.

To find the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we subtract the number of watermelons harvested from the total remaining:

84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

Therefore, the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks is 21.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the total cost of the fleet of cars, we must consider the initial purchase price, the tax liability, and the registration fees.

First, we calculate the total cost of the cars: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000.

Next, we calculate the tax liability, which is 10% of the total cost of the cars. This can be expressed as 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fee for each car is $1000, so the total registration fee for the fleet is 12 cars * $1000 per car = $12,000.

To find the total cost, we sum the initial purchase price, the tax liability, and the registration fee: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

Therefore, the total cost of the fleet of cars, including tax and registration, is $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To determine the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we first need to establish the number of shells she collected on Monday. Given that Robert collects 20 shells on Monday, and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, we can express this relationship as:

Kylie's shells on Monday = Robert's shells on Monday + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 20 + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 25

Next, we need to calculate the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, which is 2 times the number of shells she collected on Monday. This can be expressed as:

Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 × Kylie's shells on Monday
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 × 25
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 50

Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday."
"Given that Dax observed half as many bugs as ants in the garden, and there were 50 ants, we can determine the total number of insects by first calculating the number of bugs. 

To find the number of bugs, we can use the ratio of bugs to ants, which is 1:2. This ratio indicates that for every 2 ants, there is 1 bug. Therefore, we can calculate the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2.

Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we can find the total number of insects by adding the number of bugs and ants.

Total number of insects = Number of bugs + Number of ants
Total number of insects = 25 + 50
Total number of insects = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To determine the number of penguins still left sunbathing, we can apply a straightforward mathematical approach. Given that there are 36 penguins initially, we can calculate the number of penguins that leave the sunbathing area by considering the fractions that jump in the ocean and go inside the cave.

One-third of the penguins jump in the ocean, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12$ penguins. Similarly, another one-third of the penguins go inside the cave, which is also equal to $\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12$ penguins.

The total number of penguins that leave the sunbathing area is the sum of these two fractions, which is $12 + 12 = 24$ penguins.

To find the number of penguins still left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: $36 - 24 = 12$ penguins.

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of vines Steve needs to support his and his girlfriend's cherry tomato consumption, we must first calculate their combined weekly tomato intake. 

Given that Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, we can calculate his weekly consumption as follows:

Steve's weekly consumption = 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can infer that his girlfriend's daily consumption is half of his, which is 3 tomatoes/day. Therefore, her weekly consumption is:

Girlfriend's weekly consumption = 3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The combined weekly consumption of Steve and his girlfriend is the sum of their individual consumptions:

Combined weekly consumption = Steve's weekly consumption + Girlfriend's weekly consumption
= 42 tomatoes/week + 21 tomatoes/week
= 63 tomatoes/week

Given that each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can calculate the number of vines required to meet their combined weekly consumption as follows:

Number of vines = Combined weekly consumption / Tomatoes per vine
= 63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine
= 21 vines

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to support his and his girlfriend's cherry tomato consumption.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we must first calculate the total number of slices required to accommodate all 20 friends, ensuring each receives 4 slices. This can be achieved by multiplying the total number of friends by the number of slices per friend.

Let's denote the total number of friends as $n = 20$ and the number of slices per friend as $s = 4$. The total number of slices required is then given by the product of these two values:

$$\text{Total slices required} = n \cdot s = 20 \cdot 4 = 80$$

Since pizzas are sold in slices of 8, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza to determine the minimum number of pizzas needed. Let's denote the number of slices per pizza as $p = 8$. The number of pizzas required is then given by:

$$\text{Number of pizzas required} = \frac{\text{Total slices required}}{p} = \frac{80}{8} = 10$$

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends receives 4 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of pens Ram gets, we can model this scenario as a geometric series. Let's denote the number of pens Ram buys as $n$. In this case, $n = 25$. 

The number of new pens he can make from the ink of the first set of pens is $\frac{n}{5}$. This is because he can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens. So, the number of new pens from the first set is $\frac{25}{5} = 5$.

Now, he has 5 empty pens left. He can use the ink from these 5 pens to make $\frac{5}{5} = 1$ new pen.

To find the total number of pens, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens he can make from the first set and the number of new pens from the remaining 5 empty pens: $n + \frac{n}{5} + \frac{5}{5} = 25 + 5 + 1 = 31$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To determine the amount of money Johnny had after a year, we can apply the concept of compound growth. Initially, Johnny's allowance of $20 is augmented by an additional $10, resulting in a total of $30. This sum then undergoes a tripling in value over the course of a year.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Initial Amount = $20 + $10 = $30

Compound Growth = 3 × Initial Amount
= 3 × $30
= $90

Therefore, after a year, Johnny's investment has grown to $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"Given the problem, we can establish a linear relationship between the ages of the three girls. Let's denote Jessa's age as J, Joan's age as J', and Mary's age as M. We are given that Jessa is 20 years old, so J = 20.

We also know that Joan is five years older than Jessa, which can be expressed as J' = J + 5. Substituting the value of J, we get J' = 20 + 5 = 25.

Furthermore, Mary is two years younger than Joan, so M = J' - 2. Substituting the value of J', we get M = 25 - 2 = 23.

To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we can simply add their individual ages: J + J' + M = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To determine the number of students who exited through exit C, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

Initially, there were 1000 students in the hall. We are given that 30% of the students exited through exit A. This can be calculated as follows:

30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students exited through exit A.

The remaining students in the hall are then 1000 - 300 = 700.

Next, we are told that 3/5 of the remaining students exited through exit B. This can be calculated as follows:

3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students exited through exit B.

Now, we need to find the number of students who exited through exit C. Since the remaining students after exit B are the ones who exited through exit C, we can calculate this as follows:

Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280 students exited through exit C.

Therefore, the number of students who exited through exit C is 280.

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a relationship between the number of candies each individual possesses. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as R, James has as J, and John has as H. We are given the following information:

1. H = 54 (John has 54 candies)
2. H = 2R (John has twice as many candies as Robert)
3. J = R + 6 (James has 6 more candies than Robert)

From equation (2), we can express R in terms of H: R = H / 2 = 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we can substitute the value of R into equation (3) to find J: J = 27 + 6 = 33.

To determine the difference in the number of candies between John and James, we subtract J from H: H - J = 54 - 33 = 21.

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"In this scenario, we can model the problem as a simple combinatorial problem. Let's denote the number of books Dolly has as D and the number of books Pandora has as P. Given that Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own, the total number of books read by Dolly can be calculated as D + P + P (since she reads Pandora's book) = 2D + P. Similarly, the total number of books read by Pandora can be calculated as D + P + D (since she reads Dolly's book) = D + 2P.

Given that Dolly has 2 books (D = 2) and Pandora has 1 book (P = 1), we can substitute these values into the equations to find the total number of books read by each person. For Dolly, the total number of books read is 2D + P = 2(2) + 1 = 5. For Pandora, the total number of books read is D + 2P = 2 + 2(1) = 4.

However, this approach counts each book twice, since each person reads both of their own books. To find the total number of unique books read, we need to subtract the number of books each person reads themselves from the total. The total number of books read is (2D + P) + (D + 2P) - 2(D + P) = 2D + P + D + 2P - 2D - 2P = D + P.

Substituting the given values, we get D + P = 2 + 1 = 3. However, this is the number of books each person reads, not the total number of books read. Since each book is read twice (once by each person), we need to multiply this by 2 to get the total number of books read.

The total number of books read is 2(D + P) = 2(3) = 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the time Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

Let's begin by calculating the total number of letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is $2 \times 3 = 6$ letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is $6 \times 5 = 30$ pages.

As Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is $6 \times 5 = 30$ pages.

In total, Mike writes $30 + 30 = 60$ pages a week.

Given that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is $60 \times 6 = 360$ minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: $\frac{360}{60} = 6$ hours.

Therefore, the total time Mike spends writing a week is 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes used for his daily calls and the extra minutes, then subtract that from his total minutes.

First, let's calculate the total minutes used for his daily calls. Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day and there are 30 days in the month, we can use the formula:

Total minutes used for daily calls = 15 minutes/day * 30 days
= 15 * 30
= 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has 300 extra minutes of calls this month. Therefore, the total minutes used is the sum of the minutes used for daily calls and the extra minutes:

Total minutes used = 450 minutes + 300 minutes
= 750 minutes

Now, we can find the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan by subtracting the total minutes used from the total minutes in the plan:

Remaining minutes = Total minutes in the plan - Total minutes used
= 1000 minutes - 750 minutes
= 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach, utilizing basic algebraic manipulations to isolate the variable representing the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Let's denote the initial number of fries Griffin had as $G$, the number of fries Kyle took as $K$, the number of fries Billy took as $B$, the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as $x$, and the number of fries Colby took as $C$. We are given that $G = 24$, $K = 5$, and $B = 2K = 10$. We also know that $C = K - 3 = 2$.

We can express the number of fries Griffin had after each transaction as follows:

1. After Kyle took $K$ fries, Griffin had $G - K = 24 - 5 = 19$ fries.
2. After Billy took $B$ fries, Griffin had $19 - B = 19 - 10 = 9$ fries.
3. After Ginger gave $x$ fries to Griffin, Griffin had $9 + x$ fries.
4. After Colby took $C$ fries, Griffin had $9 + x - C = 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x$ fries.

We are given that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation $7 + x = 27$ to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Solving the equation $7 + x = 27$, we get $x = 27 - 7 = 20$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's analyze the given problem. We have two aquariums, one containing 4 snails and the other containing 32 snails. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is 28, which is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Therefore, the total number of fish is 2x.

We can set up the equation based on the given information:

28 = 2(2x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

28 = 4x

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 4:

x = 28/4

x = 7

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total cost incurred by the makeup artist, we must first calculate the daily cost, then multiply it by the number of days worked per week, and finally, by the number of weeks.

Given that the makeup artist charges $250 per hour and requires 6 hours to complete the makeup each day, the daily cost can be calculated as follows:

Daily cost = Hourly rate × Number of hours worked per day
= $250 × 6
= $1500

Since the makeup artist works 4 days a week, the weekly cost is:

Weekly cost = Daily cost × Number of days worked per week
= $1500 × 4
= $6000

The movie production spans 5 weeks, so the total cost incurred by the makeup artist is:

Total cost = Weekly cost × Number of weeks
= $6000 × 5
= $30,000

After completing the movie, the makeup artist receives a 10% discount on the total cost. To calculate the discount, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (expressed as a decimal):

Discount = Total cost × Discount percentage
= $30,000 × 0.10
= $3000

The final amount paid by the makeup artist is the total cost minus the discount:

Amount paid = Total cost - Discount
= $30,000 - $3000
= $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To determine the amount each person paid for the party supplies, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party. This involves summing the individual expenses for the cake, presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags.

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Given that Isabelle and her two parents split the cost evenly, we have a total of 3 individuals sharing the expenses. To find the amount each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$\frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of individuals}} = \frac{\$96}{3}$
$\frac{\$96}{3} = \$32$

Therefore, each person paid $32."
"To determine the total cost of the onions, we must first calculate the total weight of the onions purchased by the chef. Given that each bag weighs 50 pounds and the chef bought 4 bags, we can calculate the total weight as follows:

Total weight = Number of bags × Weight per bag
Total weight = 4 bags × 50 pounds/bag
Total weight = 200 pounds

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the onions. The cost per pound of onions is $1.50. Therefore, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Total cost = Total weight × Cost per pound
Total cost = 200 pounds × $1.50/pound
Total cost = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister, we can first calculate the total number of cookies each individual consumed. 

Let's denote the number of cookies eaten by Sue's sister on Monday as $x$. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, the number of cookies eaten by Sue on Monday is $4x$. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, which is $2(13) = 26$ cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation $4x + 26 = 46$ to find the value of $x$.

Solving for $x$, we have:
$4x + 26 = 46$
$4x = 46 - 26$
$4x = 20$
$x = 5$

Now that we know the value of $x$, we can calculate the total number of cookies eaten by Sue and her sister. Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, for a total of $5 + 13 = 18$ cookies. Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, which is $4(5) = 20$ cookies, and 26 cookies on Tuesday, for a total of $20 + 26 = 46$ cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by Sue's sister is $18 \times 200 = 3600$ calories, and the total calories consumed by Sue is $46 \times 200 = 9200$ calories. Therefore, the difference in calories consumed is $9200 - 3600 = 5600$ calories.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5600}$"
"Given that each class in the school has 20 students and there are 3 classes, we can calculate the total number of students in the school as 20 * 3 = 60.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We are given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. Therefore, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33.

However, this implies that the number of boys in the third class is 30 - 33 = -3, which is not possible. This inconsistency suggests that the given information is incorrect or incomplete.

However, if we assume that the given information is correct, we can proceed with the calculation. In this case, the number of boys in the third class is -3, but this is not a feasible solution.

To resolve this inconsistency, let's re-examine the given information. We know that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and each class has 20 students. We can use this information to find the number of boys in the third class.

Let's denote the number of boys in the third class as x. Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the third class is 0.5 * 20 = 10.

We are given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. Therefore, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

The total number of girls in the school is 30, and the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the number of boys in the third class is x, the total number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

However, we know that the number of boys in the third class is 10, which is not equal to 17. This inconsistency suggests that the given information is incorrect or incomplete.

However, if we assume that the given information is correct, we can proceed with the calculation. In this case, the number of boys in the third class is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the current number of apps on Travis's tablet, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. Initially, Travis had 61 apps. He then deleted 9 apps, resulting in a reduction of his app collection. This can be represented as:

61 - 9 = 52

Subsequently, Travis downloaded 18 new apps, which can be added to the updated total:

52 + 18 = 70

Therefore, the current number of apps on Travis's tablet is 70."
"To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we can break down the information provided into two distinct events: the first event, where Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars, and the second event, where he killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night.

Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed today as x. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, we have the equation x = 15 - 3, which simplifies to x = 12.

Given that he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x = 3(12) = 36.

The total number of wolves killed is the sum of the wolves killed in both events: 10 (last night) + 36 (today) = 46.

The total number of cougars killed is the sum of the cougars killed in both events: 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27.

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is 46 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 73.

The final answer is: $\boxed{73}$"
"To determine the floor Bill is on, we can apply a simple arithmetic operation. Given that Bill starts on the 3rd floor and rides the elevator up to the floor that's equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6, we can express this as an algebraic expression:

Let x be the starting floor. Then, the target floor is given by the expression 4x + 6.

Substituting x = 3 into the expression, we get:

4(3) + 6 = 12 + 6 = 18

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To determine the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to calculate the number of times Anne went down the slide. Given that Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can express this as:

Let x be the number of times Mitchel went down the slide. Then, the number of times Anne went down the slide is x - 0.3x = 0.7x.

We are given that x = 30. Therefore, the number of times Anne went down the slide is 0.7(30) = 21.

Since Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, we can express this as:

Number of times Robert went down the slide = 4 × Number of times Anne went down the slide
= 4 × 21
= 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to calculate the total number of cows added to each stall. Given that Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls, we can calculate the number of cows added to each stall as follows:

Let's denote the number of cows added to each stall as x. Then, the total number of cows added is 10x. Since Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows, we can set up the equation:

10x = 40

Solving for x, we get:

x = 40 / 10
x = 4

Now that we know each stall has 4 additional cows, we can calculate the total number of cows in each stall by adding the initial 20 cows to the 4 new cows:

Number of cows in each stall = 20 + 4
= 24

To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:

Number of cows in 8 stalls = 24 * 8
= 192

The final answer is: $\boxed{192}$"
"To determine the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then sum them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the coins. We have 100 pennies, 40 nickels, and 20 dimes. The values of these coins can be calculated as follows:

- 100 pennies = 100 \* $0.01 = $1.00
- 40 nickels = 40 \* $0.05 = $2.00
- 20 dimes = 20 \* $0.10 = $2.00

Next, we need to calculate the value of the dollar bills. We have 40 dollar bills, each with a value of $1.00.

- 40 dollar bills = 40 \* $1.00 = $40.00

Now, let's add the values of the coins and the dollar bills together to find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank:

$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Brady has a total of $45.00 in his piggy bank.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To determine the total weight of the redwood, we must first calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. Given that the redwood is 200 feet tall, we can divide the total height by the length of each section to obtain the number of sections: 

$$\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}.$$

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we can calculate the total weight of the redwood by multiplying the number of sections by the weight of each section:

$$20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}.$$

However, termites have consumed 30% of the wood, so we must subtract 30% of the total weight from the total weight to find the final weight. To calculate 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3:

$$0.3 \times 8000 = 2400 \text{ pounds}.$$

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000 to find the final weight:

$$8000 - 2400 = 5600 \text{ pounds}.$$

The final weight of the redwood is 5600 pounds."
"To determine the total amount Nancy has to pay for the overdue books, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books can be calculated using the formula:

Cost = Number of books * Cost per book

Given that Nancy owes $0.50 per book and she has 8 books, the cost of the overdue books is:

Cost = 8 * $0.50
Cost = $4.00

Additionally, there is a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is the sum of the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee:

Total amount = Cost + Flat fee
Total amount = $4.00 + $2.00
Total amount = $6.00

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To solve this problem, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of apples that Jamal has as $J_a$ and the number of bananas that Jamal has as $J_b$. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can express this as:

$$A_a = J_a + 8$$

where $A_a$ represents the number of apples that Andrea has. We are given that Andrea has 52 apples, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

$$52 = J_a + 8$$

Solving for $J_a$, we get:

$$J_a = 52 - 8 = 44$$

We are also given that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so we can express this as:

$$J_b = J_a + 4$$

Substituting the value of $J_a$ we found earlier, we get:

$$J_b = 44 + 4 = 48$$

We are also given that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can express this as:

$$A_b = \frac{1}{2}J_b$$

Substituting the value of $J_b$ we found earlier, we get:

$$A_b = \frac{1}{2}(48) = 24$$

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have:

$$\text{Total Fruits} = A_a + J_a + A_b + J_b = 52 + 44 + 24 + 48$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$\text{Total Fruits} = 168$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour required, we need to calculate the total number of cookies Carla is making and then divide that by the number of cookies per cup of flour.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we can express this as a ratio: 12 cookies : 2 cups of flour. To find the amount of flour needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion:

(12 cookies / 2 cups) = (66 cookies / x cups)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

12x = 66 * 2

12x = 132

Now, we can divide both sides by 12 to find x:

x = 132 / 12

x = 11

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to calculate two thirds of the total number of pennies, which is 9,300. This can be expressed as:

(2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200

Since each penny is valued at $0.01, we can multiply the result by 0.01 to obtain the total dollar amount:

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

Therefore, the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62.

The final answer is: $62"
"To determine the total number of marbles Maddison possesses, we must first calculate the initial number of marbles she has in her possession. Given that she has 5 boxes, each containing 50 marbles, we can calculate the total as follows:

Initial marbles = Number of boxes × Number of marbles per box
Initial marbles = 5 × 50
Initial marbles = 250

Subsequently, Maddison receives 20 marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles she now possesses, we add the initial number of marbles to the number of marbles received:

Total marbles = Initial marbles + Marbles received
Total marbles = 250 + 20
Total marbles = 270

Therefore, Maddison now has a total of 270 marbles."
"To determine the difference in the number of trees between Harry's and Ferdinand's yards, we can establish a sequence of relationships between the number of trees each individual possesses.

Let's denote the number of trees in Chris's yard as $C$, the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard as $F$, and the number of trees in Harry's yard as $H$. We are given that $C = 6$.

Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so we can express this relationship as $F = \frac{1}{2}C$. Substituting the value of $C$, we get $F = \frac{1}{2}(6) = 3$.

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. This relationship can be expressed as $H = 2F + 5$. Substituting the value of $F$, we get $H = 2(3) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11$.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we can calculate $H - F = 11 - 3 = 8$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the combined amount of money the three girls have, we can utilize a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

Let's denote the amount of money Carmen has as C. Given that Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, we can express Samantha's amount as C + $25. Similarly, since Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, Daisy's amount can be represented as (C + $25) + $50.

We are given that Carmen has $100. Therefore, we can substitute C = $100 into the expressions for Samantha's and Daisy's amounts. This yields Samantha's amount as $100 + $25 = $125 and Daisy's amount as ($100 + $25) + $50 = $175.

Now, to find the total amount of money the three girls have combined, we can add their individual amounts: C + (C + $25) + ((C + $25) + $50). Substituting C = $100, we get $100 + ($100 + $25) + ($100 + $25 + $50) = $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To determine the total cost of the house, we must consider the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. The selling price of the property is $350,000. The brokerage fee, which is typically a percentage of the selling price, is 5%. This can be calculated as 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500. The transfer fee, another percentage of the selling price, is 12%, which translates to 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total cost of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find the difference between the total cost and Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000, we subtract the budget from the total cost: $409,500 - $400,000 = $4,500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees, which amount to 3% of the selling price. This can be expressed as:

Transfer fees = 0.03 \* Selling price
= 0.03 \* $400,000
= $12,000

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price:

Brokerage fee = 0.05 \* Selling price
= 0.05 \* $400,000
= $20,000

The total fees paid by Mr. Tan are the sum of the transfer fees and the brokerage fee:

Total fees = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee
= $12,000 + $20,000
= $32,000

Now, we can calculate the net selling price by subtracting the total fees from the selling price:

Net selling price = Selling price - Total fees
= $400,000 - $32,000
= $368,000

Finally, we subtract the remaining loan amount from the net selling price to determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds:

Net proceeds = Net selling price - Remaining loan amount
= $368,000 - $250,000
= $118,000

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To determine the total time required to cook the chicken, we must first calculate the time it takes to heat the oil to the desired temperature of 400 degrees. Given that it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, we can calculate the additional time required to reach 400 degrees.

The time required to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes. To calculate this, we can express the additional time as a percentage of the initial time:

Additional time = 40% of 20 minutes
= 0.4 × 20 minutes
= 8 minutes

Therefore, the total time required to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:

20 minutes (initial heating) + 8 minutes (additional heating)
= 28 minutes

Once the oil has reached 400 degrees, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Therefore, the cooking time is:

Cooking time = 28 minutes (heating time) - 5 minutes
= 23 minutes

The total time required to cook the chicken, from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, is the sum of the heating time and the cooking time:

Total time = 20 minutes (initial heating) + 28 minutes (heating to 400 degrees) + 23 minutes (cooking)
= 71 minutes

The final answer is: 71"
"To determine the total expenditure on advertising, we can apply the principle of linear algebra. Let's denote the cost of a newspaper ad as $N and the cost of a television ad as $T. We are given that N = $5 and T = $75. The number of newspaper ads purchased is denoted as n, which is 50, and the number of television ads purchased is denoted as t, which is 15.

The total expenditure on newspaper ads can be calculated as the product of the cost of a single ad and the number of ads purchased: N * n = $5 * 50 = $250.

Similarly, the total expenditure on television ads can be calculated as the product of the cost of a single ad and the number of ads purchased: T * t = $75 * 15 = $1125.

To find the total expenditure on all ads, we can add the expenditures on newspaper and television ads: N * n + T * t = $250 + $1125 = $1375.

The final answer is: $1375"
"Given that a juggler can juggle 16 balls, and half of the balls are golf balls, we can deduce the number of golf balls as follows:

Let G represent the total number of golf balls. Since half of the balls are golf balls, we can express this as:

G = Total balls / 2
G = 16 / 2
G = 8

Now, we are told that half of the golf balls are blue. Let B represent the number of blue golf balls. We can express this as:

B = G / 2
B = 8 / 2
B = 4

Therefore, there are 4 blue golf balls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total number of M&Ms Mary obtained, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them together.

Let's denote the number of M&Ms in the first bag as $x$. We are given that the first bag contains 300 M&Ms, so $x = 300$.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, which can be expressed as $x + 12$. Since we know $x = 300$, the second bag contains $300 + 12 = 312$ M&Ms.

The third bag has a hole in it, resulting in half the number of M&Ms as the first bag. This can be represented as $\frac{x}{2}$. Substituting $x = 300$, we find that the third bag contains $\frac{300}{2} = 150$ M&Ms.

Now, we can calculate the total number of M&Ms by summing the contents of each bag: $x + (x + 12) + \frac{x}{2}$. Substituting the known values, we get $300 + 312 + 150 = 762$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{762}$"
"To determine the total number of windows in the houses, we can break down the problem into manageable components. 

First, we calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms. Since each house has 3 bedrooms and each bedroom has 2 windows, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is given by the product of the number of bedrooms per house and the number of windows per bedroom, multiplied by the total number of houses. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

Total windows in bedrooms = (3 bedrooms/house) * (2 windows/bedroom) * (2 houses) = 12 windows

Next, we consider the additional windows in each house that are not connected to bedrooms. There are 4 such windows in each house, and since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:

Total additional windows = (4 windows/house) * (2 houses) = 8 windows

To find the total number of windows in the houses, we sum the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the total number of additional windows:

Total windows = Total windows in bedrooms + Total additional windows
= 12 + 8
= 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the change received by the mother, we need to calculate the total cost of the items purchased and subtract this amount from the amount she paid.

The total cost of the items can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Cost of cocoa + Cost of laundry + Cost of pasta
Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35
Total cost = $14.00

Now, to find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

Change = Amount paid - Total cost
Change = $20 - $14.00
Change = $6.00

Therefore, the change received by the mother is $6.00."
"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, we can utilize a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of stitches for each sleeve as $s$, the number of stitches for the collar as $c$, and the number of stitches for the rosette as $r$.

We are given that the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, the collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, and the rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$\begin{cases}
s + s + c + r = 1800 \\
c = \frac{1}{10} \cdot 900 \\
r = 2c
\end{cases}$$

Simplifying the second equation, we have $c = 90$. Substituting this value into the third equation, we get $r = 2 \cdot 90 = 180$.

Substituting the values of $c$ and $r$ into the first equation, we have:

$$2s + 90 + 180 = 1800$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$2s + 270 = 1800$$

Subtracting 270 from both sides, we have:

$$2s = 1530$$

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

$$s = 765$$

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 765 stitches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{765}$"
"To determine the total expenditure on seeds, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then summing these values.

The cost of the tomato seeds can be calculated as follows:

20 packets of tomato seeds * $40 per packet = 20 × 40 = $800

Similarly, the cost of the celery seeds is:

80 packets of celery seeds * $30 per packet = 80 × 30 = $2400

Therefore, the total cost of the seeds is the sum of the costs of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds:

$800 + $2400 = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we can break down the information provided.

Let's denote the number of lines in the solo song as $S = 54$. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so the total number of lines in the first scene is $2S = 2 \times 54 = 108$. Since only a third of these lines are Sean's, we can calculate his lines from the first scene as $\frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36$.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so the total number of lines in the second scene is $S + 6 = 54 + 6 = 60$. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so we can calculate his lines from the second scene as $\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48$.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: $S + 36 + 48 = 54 + 36 + 48 = 138$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{138}$"
"To determine the number of cards with the letter D, we can apply a stepwise approach to calculate the proportion of cards with each letter.

First, we calculate the number of cards with the letter A: $\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32$ cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are $80 - 32 = 48$. Then, we calculate the number of cards with the letter B: $\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24$ cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are $48 - 24 = 24$. Then, we calculate the number of cards with the letter C: $\frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15$ cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: $80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9$ cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we can calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Let's denote the time it takes to dig a small hole as $t_s = 3$ minutes and the time it takes to dig a large hole as $t_l = 10$ minutes. We are given that Matthew needs to dig $n_s = 30$ small holes and $n_l = 15$ large holes.

The total time it takes to dig the small holes is given by the product of the time per hole and the number of holes: $t_{\text{small}} = n_s \cdot t_s = 30 \cdot 3 = 90$ minutes.

Similarly, the total time it takes to dig the large holes is given by the product of the time per hole and the number of holes: $t_{\text{large}} = n_l \cdot t_l = 15 \cdot 10 = 150$ minutes.

The total time it takes to dig all the holes is the sum of the time for small holes and large holes: $t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{small}} + t_{\text{large}} = 90 + 150 = 240$ minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60: $t_{\text{total}} = \frac{240}{60} = 4$ hours.

Therefore, the total time it takes Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is 4 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Given that the sum of Mico and Marco's ages is 20, we can express this as an equation: M + m = 20, where M represents Mico's current age and m represents Marco's current age.

To determine the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to consider the future ages of both individuals. In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be m + 10. Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (m + 10).

Substituting M + m = 20 into the equation (M + 10) + (m + 10), we get (20 + 10) + (20 + 10) = 30 + 30 = 60.

Thus, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. We can model this problem using a system of linear equations.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can rewrite the second equation as R + 9 = 3S + 27.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides yields 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides yields 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3 yields S = 6.

Therefore, Sam's current age is 6 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total amount Peter paid, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately and then sum them.

The cost of the popsicles can be calculated as the product of the number of popsicles and the price per popsicle: 20 * $0.25 = $5.00.

Similarly, the cost of the ice cream bars is the product of the number of ice cream bars and the price per ice cream bar: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars: $5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00.

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is $7.00.

The final answer is: $7"
"To determine the total number of spots on the snakes in the park, we first need to calculate the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas separately. 

The number of spots on a cobra is given as 70. Since there are 40 cobras in the park, the total number of spots on the cobras can be calculated as follows:

Total spots on cobras = Number of cobras × Number of spots per cobra
= 40 × 70
= 2800

Given that the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we can calculate the number of spots per mamba as follows:

Number of spots per mamba = Number of spots per cobra / 2
= 70 / 2
= 35

Now, we can calculate the total number of spots on the mambas:

Total spots on mambas = Number of mambas × Number of spots per mamba
= 60 × 35
= 2100

To find the total number of spots on all the snakes in the park, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas:

Total spots = Total spots on cobras + Total spots on mambas
= 2800 + 2100
= 4900

Finally, we need to find half the total number of spots:

Half the total spots = Total spots / 2
= 4900 / 2
= 2450

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the total amount Maddy will spend on pizzas, we must first calculate the total number of individuals she needs to accommodate. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, yielding a total of 15 individuals. Each team member brings 2 guests, resulting in 12 * 2 = 24 additional individuals. Therefore, the total number of people Maddy needs to provide for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Given that each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas required is 39 / 3 = 13.

Since each pizza costs $15, the total expenditure can be calculated as 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we must first calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the spaces between the gemstones.

Given that each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and there are 8 of them, the total length occupied by the gemstones is $8 \cdot 1 = 8$ inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. 

The space between the gemstones is filled with sterling silver beads, and each bead is $\frac{1}{4}$ inch long. To find the number of beads, we need to find the total length of the spaces between the gemstones. Since there are 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them. The total length of these spaces is $7 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{7}{4} = 1.75$ inches.

Now, we subtract the length occupied by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the spaces: $25 - 8 = 17$ inches.

However, we already know that the length of the spaces is 1.75 inches. To find the number of beads, we need to divide the length of the spaces by the length of each bead: $\frac{1.75}{\frac{1}{4}} = 1.75 \div \frac{1}{4} = 1.75 \cdot \frac{4}{1} = 7$.

Therefore, Katerina uses 7 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot, we first need to calculate the number of stories written in the first week and the second week separately.

Let's denote the number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot in the first week as A, B, and M, respectively. We are given that A = 20, B = 40, and M = 60.

The total number of stories written in the first week is the sum of the individual contributions from each family member, which is A + B + M = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120.

In the second week, each family member doubles the number of stories they wrote in the first week. Therefore, the number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot in the second week are 2A, 2B, and 2M, respectively.

Substituting the values of A, B, and M, we get 2A = 2(20) = 40, 2B = 2(40) = 80, and 2M = 2(60) = 120.

The total number of stories written in the second week is the sum of the individual contributions from each family member, which is 2A + 2B + 2M = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240.

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week: 120 + 240 = 360.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the brother's age in 3 years, we first need to establish his current age. Given that Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can express this relationship as a simple algebraic equation: 

Let B represent the brother's age. Then, B = 2 * 9, since the brother's age is twice Ann's age. 

B = 2 * 9
B = 18

Therefore, the brother's current age is 18 years. To find his age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age.

Brother's age in 3 years = B + 3
= 18 + 3
= 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left after purchasing a can of pop, we need to calculate the total value of her initial assets and then subtract the cost of the pop.

Kelly possesses 5 quarters and 2 dimes. The value of a quarter is $0.25, and the value of a dime is $0.10. Therefore, the total value of her quarters is 5 \* $0.25 = $1.25, and the total value of her dimes is 2 \* $0.10 = $0.20.

The total amount Kelly has is the sum of the value of her quarters and dimes, which is $1.25 + $0.20 = $1.45.

Now, if she buys a can of pop for $0.55, we can calculate the amount of money she has left by subtracting the cost of the pop from her total assets:

$1.45 - $0.55 = $0.90

Therefore, Kelly has $0.90 left after purchasing the can of pop.

The final answer is: $0.90"
"To determine the number of rows of 5-star configurations on the flag, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of 5-star rows as 'x'. The total number of stars in the 8-star rows is 3 * 8 = 24, and the total number of stars in the 6-star rows is 2 * 6 = 12. The total number of stars in the 5-star rows is 5x.

The total number of stars on the flag is given as 76. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of stars:

24 + 12 + 5x = 76

Simplifying the equation, we get:

36 + 5x = 76

Subtracting 36 from both sides of the equation yields:

5x = 40

Dividing both sides of the equation by 5 gives us:

x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5-star configurations on the flag.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks required to transport 80 flagstones, we must first calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Given that each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, the total weight can be calculated as follows:

Total weight = Number of flagstones × Weight per flagstone
Total weight = 80 flagstones × 75 pounds/flagstone
Total weight = 6000 pounds

Next, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks to determine the number of trucks needed:

Number of trucks = Total weight / Weight capacity per truck
Number of trucks = 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck
Number of trucks = 3

Therefore, three trucks will be required to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Given that the car in the fast lane is traveling at a constant velocity of 60 miles per hour, and it covers a total distance of 480 miles, we can calculate the time taken using the fundamental kinematic equation:

t = d / v

where t is the time, d is the distance, and v is the velocity.

Substituting the given values, we get:

t = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its velocity is 30 miles per hour. To find the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance, we can use the same kinematic equation:

t = d / v

Substituting the given values, we get:

t = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

Therefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance is 16 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic equations.

Let x be the total number of medals given out for counting. We are given that Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals. Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

We are also given that together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This can be expressed as an equation:

39 = x - 10x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

39 = -9x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x by dividing both sides of the equation by -9:

x = 39 / -9
x = -4.33

However, the number of medals cannot be negative, as it represents a count. This suggests that the original statement ""10 times less medals"" might be interpreted as ""10 times more medals"" or ""10 times the number of medals they have."" Let's re-examine the problem.

If we assume that together, they have 10 times more medals than have been given out for counting, we can set up the equation:

39 = 10x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 39 / 10
x = 3.9

However, this still doesn't make sense, as the number of medals cannot be a decimal. Let's re-examine the problem again.

If we assume that together, they have 10 times the number of medals they have, we can set up the equation:

39 = x/10

Solving for x, we get:

x = 39 * 10
x = 390

This solution makes sense, as the number of medals is a whole number.

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Given that each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, we can calculate the total number of chocolate bars as follows:

$$\text{Total chocolate bars} = 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars}.$$

Next, we need to find out how many chocolate bars will be allocated to the adults. Since each adult receives 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars allocated to the adults is:

$$\text{Chocolate bars allocated to adults} = 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars}.$$

Now, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars remaining for the children. This can be calculated as follows:

$$\text{Remaining chocolate bars} = \text{Total chocolate bars} - \text{Chocolate bars allocated to adults} = 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ chocolate bars}.$$

Since there are 8 children, we can find out how many chocolate bars each child will receive by dividing the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children:

$$\text{Chocolate bars per child} = \frac{\text{Remaining chocolate bars}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{16}{8} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars}.$$

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine Susan's earnings for the online task, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's calculate the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a duration of 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

The time she works can be expressed as:

t = 3 hours - 0.5 hours
t = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes first. 

t (in minutes) = 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour
t (in minutes) = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

Number of intervals = t (in minutes) / 10 minutes
= 150 minutes / 10 minutes
= 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

Earnings = Number of intervals * Earnings per interval
= 15 intervals * $5/interval
= $75

The final answer is: $75"
"Given the scenario, we can model the points of each player as a function of the round number. Let's denote the points of Mike, Jim, and Tony as $M_r$, $J_r$, and $T_r$ respectively, where $r$ represents the round number.

Initially, after 3 rounds, we have:
- $M_3 = 21$
- $J_3 = M_3 - 3 = 18$
- $T_3 = 2M_3 = 42$

In the fourth round, every player receives an extra point if they have more than 20 points. This can be represented as:
- $M_4 = M_3 + \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } M_3 > 20 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$
- $J_4 = J_3 + \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } J_3 > 20 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$
- $T_4 = T_3 + \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } T_3 > 20 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$

Substituting the initial values, we get:
- $M_4 = 21 + \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } 21 > 20 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} = 22$
- $J_4 = 18 + \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } 18 > 20 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} = 18$
- $T_4 = 42 + \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } 42 > 20 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} = 43$

Now, we can calculate the total points after the fourth round:
$M_4 + J_4 + T_4 = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83$

The final answer is: $\boxed{83}$"
"To determine the number of unwashed oranges, we need to calculate the total number of oranges washed by the sons and subtract this from the initial quantity.

Let's denote the age of the oldest son as $A$. Given that the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, his age can be represented as $\frac{A}{2}$.

We are given that the oldest son is 8 years old, so $A = 8$. Therefore, the youngest son's age is $\frac{8}{2} = 4$ years.

The total number of oranges washed by the sons is the sum of the oranges washed by each son, which is $A + \frac{A}{2} = 8 + 4 = 12$.

Now, to find the number of unwashed oranges, we subtract the total number of oranges washed from the initial quantity of 15 oranges: $15 - 12 = 3$.

Therefore, the number of unwashed oranges is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total count of activities performed by Darren over the two days, we can calculate the number of exercises for each day and then sum them.

Let's denote the number of pushups, squats, and dumbbell presses on the first day as P1, S1, and D1, respectively. On the second day, the number of pushups, squats, and dumbbell presses are P2, S2, and D2, respectively.

Given that:
- P1 = 100
- S1 = 50
- D1 = 20

On the second day, we have:
- P2 = P1 + 20 = 100 + 20 = 120
- S2 = S1 - 10 = 50 - 10 = 40
- D2 = 2 * D1 = 2 * 20 = 40

Now, we can calculate the total number of activities for each day:
- Total for Day 1 = P1 + S1 + D1 = 100 + 50 + 20 = 170
- Total for Day 2 = P2 + S2 + D2 = 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

The total count of activities over the two days is the sum of the total activities for each day:
Total count of activities = Total for Day 1 + Total for Day 2 = 170 + 200 = 370

The final answer is: $\boxed{370}$"
"To determine the duration a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household with 5 members who consume rice for both lunch and dinner, we first calculate the daily rice consumption.

Each individual consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. Therefore, the daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals/day = 0.4 kg/day.

For a household with 5 members, the total daily consumption is 5 * 0.4 kg/day = 2 kg/day.

To find the duration the rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the daily consumption (2 kg/day).

$$\frac{42\, \text{kg}}{2\, \text{kg/day}} = 21\, \text{days}$$

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the duration in weeks by dividing the total number of days by 7.

$$\frac{21\, \text{days}}{7\, \text{days/week}} = 3\, \text{weeks}$$

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and subtract that from his target.

Let's denote the number of crates sold on Monday and Friday as x, since he was closed on those days. The number of crates sold over the weekend is given as 20, and the number of crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday are 15, 12, and 18, respectively.

Total crates sold = x + x + 20 + 15 + 12 + 18
Total crates sold = 2x + 65

We know that Sam's target is 120 crates. To find the number of crates he was off from his target, we need to set up an equation and solve for x.

2x + 65 = 120

Subtracting 65 from both sides of the equation gives us:

2x = 55

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us:

x = 27.5

However, since x represents the number of crates sold on Monday and Friday, and we cannot sell a fraction of a crate, we will round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, x = 27.

Now, we can find the total number of crates sold:

Total crates sold = 2x + 65
Total crates sold = 2(27) + 65
Total crates sold = 54 + 65
Total crates sold = 119

To find the number of crates Sam was off from his target, we subtract the total number of crates sold from the target:

Crates off target = Target - Total crates sold
Crates off target = 120 - 119
Crates off target = 1

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk, we can employ the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is given by:

$$S = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (2a + (n-1)d$$

where $a$ is the first term, $d$ is the common difference, and $n$ is the number of terms.

In this scenario, the first term $a$ is $200, the common difference $d$ is $50, and the number of terms $n$ is $6$ (3 bids from the other people and 3 bids from Carmen).

Plugging in the values, we get:

$$S = \frac{6}{2} \cdot (2 \cdot 200 + (6-1) \cdot 50)$$

Simplifying the expression, we have:

$$S = 3 \cdot (400 + 5 \cdot 50)$$

$$S = 3 \cdot (400 + 250)$$

$$S = 3 \cdot 650$$

$$S = 1950$$

The final answer is: $1950"
"To determine the annual cost of the driving service, we must consider the total miles driven, the cost per mile, and the monthly bonus provided to the driver.

First, we calculate the total miles driven per year. Since John commutes to work and back each day, the daily round-trip distance is 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles. With a 5-day workweek, the weekly mileage is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. Over the course of 50 weeks in a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Next, we calculate the total driving cost. Given that John is charged $2 per mile, the annual driving cost is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

In addition to the driving cost, John provides a $150 monthly bonus to the driver. To find the annual bonus, we multiply the monthly bonus by 12: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

The total annual cost of the driving service is the sum of the driving cost and the annual bonus: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year.

The final numerical answer is: $31800"
"To determine the amount of time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we must first calculate the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday. Given that he exercised for 16 minutes on Monday and 23 minutes on Sunday, we can compute the combined time as follows:

Let $M$ represent the time Peter exercised on Monday and $S$ represent the time he exercised on Sunday. Then, the combined time is given by $M + S$.

$M = 16$ minutes
$S = 23$ minutes

Combined time $= M + S = 16 + 23 = 39$ minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we can express this as $2 \times (M + S)$.

$2 \times (M + S) = 2 \times 39 = 78$ minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{78}$"
"The problem of determining the number of pieces of paper required for a 32-page tabloid can be approached from a combinatorial perspective. When folding a piece of paper to create a tabloid, we are essentially creating a two-sided structure, where each side can accommodate a specific number of pages.

To solve this problem, we can consider the number of pages that can be accommodated on each side of the folded paper. Since each side can have an equal number of pages, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to determine the number of pages per side.

However, this approach assumes that the pages are evenly distributed between the two sides. In reality, the pages are arranged in a specific order, with the first page on the left back, the second page on the left front, and so on. This creates a pattern where the pages are not evenly distributed between the two sides.

A more accurate approach is to consider the number of pages that can be accommodated on each side of the folded paper, taking into account the specific page arrangement. Since the pages are arranged in a sequence, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to determine the number of pages on each side.

Let's consider the first 16 pages, which are arranged as follows:

Page 1 (left back), Page 2 (left front), Page 3 (left back), Page 4 (left front), ..., Page 16 (left back)

Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, we can calculate the number of pages on the left side:

n = 16 (number of pages)
a = 1 (first term)
l = 16 (last term)
d = 2 (common difference)

The sum of the first 16 pages on the left side is given by:

S = n/2 (a + l)
= 16/2 (1 + 16)
= 8 (1 + 16)
= 8 × 17
= 136

Since each page is counted twice (once on the left side and once on the right side), we need to divide the total sum by 2 to get the actual number of pages on the left side:

Pages on left side = 136/2
= 68

Similarly, we can calculate the number of pages on the right side:

Pages on right side = 68

Since each piece of paper can accommodate two sides, we need two pieces of paper for the first 16 pages and another two pieces of paper for the last 16 pages.

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2 (for the first 16 pages) + 2 (for the last 16 pages) = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount of money Annika has left after spending at the town fair, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total amount spent on food and snacks, which is half of the initial $50. This can be expressed as:

Total spent on food and snacks = (1/2) × $50
= $25

Additionally, Annika spent $10 on rides. Therefore, the total amount spent is the sum of the money spent on food and snacks and the money spent on rides:

Total amount spent = $25 + $10
= $35

Now, to find the amount of money Annika has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

Amount left = Initial amount - Total amount spent
= $50 - $35
= $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we can utilize a system of linear equations to model the given information.

Let's denote the number of books sold in the first year as $x$. Since Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year, the number of books sold in the current year is $\frac{x}{2}$. We are given that the number of books sold in the current year is 45, so we can set up the equation:

$$\frac{x}{2} = 45$$

Solving for $x$, we find that $x = 90$. This means that Elise sold 90 books in the first year.

We are also given that there are 50 unsold books and that the total number of books is 250. Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is:

$$\text{Books sold in the second year} = 250 - 50 - 90 = 110$$

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:

$$\text{Total money earned in the second year} = 110 \times 20 = \boxed{2200}$$"
"To determine Watson's total earnings in April, we must first calculate his weekly earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

Given that Watson works a 10-hour shift each day and earns $10 per hour, his daily earnings are $10/hour * 10 hours/day = $100/day. Since he works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are $100/day * 5 days/week = $500/week.

Additionally, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are $500/week (hourly wage) + $300/week (bonus) = $800/week.

Since April has 4 weeks, Watson's total earnings for the month are $800/week * 4 weeks = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To determine the number of people John lost to in the arm wrestling competition, we can calculate the percentage of individuals he did not defeat. Since he beat 80% of the 20 people, we can find the number of people he lost to by subtracting the number of people he beat from the total number of participants.

Let's denote the total number of people as $n = 20$ and the percentage of people he beat as $p = 80\% = 0.8$. The number of people he beat is then given by $n \cdot p = 20 \cdot 0.8 = 16$. 

To find the number of people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of participants: $n - n \cdot p = 20 - 16 = 4$.

Therefore, John lost to $\boxed{4}$ people.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the total loaves produced are sold in the morning. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Morning sales = (2/3) × Total loaves
= (2/3) × 60
= 40 loaves

Now, we need to find the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales. This can be calculated as:

Remaining loaves = Total loaves - Morning sales
= 60 - 40
= 20 loaves

Next, we determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon. It is given that half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Afternoon sales = (1/2) × Remaining loaves
= (1/2) × 20
= 10 loaves

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the rate at which Joey loses weight and then determine how long it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we can divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we can set up a proportion to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

Let x be the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. We know that Sandy loses 1/4 of the weight in the same amount of time as Joey. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy loses 2/4 = 0.5 pounds per week.

We can set up the following proportion:

2 pounds/week (Joey's rate) = 8 pounds / x weeks (Sandy's time)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 8

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 4

However, this is the time it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds, not Sandy. Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we need to multiply the time it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds by 4:

x = 4 * 4
x = 16

"To determine the total savings from purchasing 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk, we need to calculate the savings on each item and then sum them.

First, let's consider the tubs of ice cream. The original price of 2 tubs is $13 per tub, so the total original price is 2 \* $13 = $26. The discounted price of 2 tubs is $11 per tub, so the total discounted price is 2 \* $11 = $22. The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

Next, let's consider the packets of milk. The original price of 4 packets is $1 per packet, so the total original price is 4 \* $1 = $4. The discounted price of 4 packets is $1 - $0.5 per packet, so the total discounted price is 4 \* ($1 - $0.5) = 4 \* $0.5 = $2. The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is the sum of the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk, which is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the total number of new limbs Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum will cause a person to grow after 15 days, we can employ a mathematical approach. 

First, let's consider the growth rate of extra arms. Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, we can model this as an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1 (one extra arm every 3 days). The number of terms in this sequence can be calculated as 15 / 3 = 5, representing the number of 3-day intervals within the 15-day period. Therefore, the total number of extra arms is the sum of the arithmetic sequence: 5 terms, with the first term being 1 (the first extra arm grown after 3 days) and the common difference being 1.

The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference. Substituting the values, we get:

S = 5/2 * (2*1 + (5-1)*1) = 5/2 * (2 + 4) = 5/2 * 6 = 15

However, this represents the total number of extra arms grown, but we are interested in the number of new limbs. Since each extra arm is a new limb, the total number of extra arms is indeed the correct count.

Next, let's consider the growth rate of extra legs. The person grows an extra leg every 5 days, which can be modeled as another arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1. The number of terms in this sequence is 15 / 5 = 3, representing the number of 5-day intervals within the 15-day period. The first term is 1 (the first extra leg grown after 5 days), and the common difference is 1. Using the same formula as before, we can calculate the sum of this sequence:

S = 3/2 * (2*1 + (3-1)*1) = 3/2 * (2 + 2) = 3/2 * 4 = 6

Now, we can find the total number of new limbs by adding the number of extra arms and extra legs: 15 + 6 = 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the amount Theo has available for buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we need to calculate the total expenses incurred so far and subtract the desired savings from his initial budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 suits × $100 = $600.

Next, we calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases × $50 = $150.

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since the cost of a business suit is $100, 5 times this amount is 5 × $100 = $500. Therefore, the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, we calculate the total cost incurred so far: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

To find the remaining budget, we subtract the total cost from the initial budget: $6000 (initial budget) - $1950 (total cost so far) = $4050.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract this amount from the remaining budget to determine how much he has available for gifts: $4050 (remaining budget) - $2000 (amount to save) = $2050.

Therefore, the amount available for buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is $2050.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information.

Let's denote the total number of family members as $n = 5$. Out of these, three individuals consume 3 eggs each day, while the remaining $n - 3 = 2$ individuals consume 2 eggs each day.

The total number of eggs consumed by the three individuals who eat 3 eggs each day is $3 \times 3 = 9$ eggs per day.

The total number of eggs consumed by the remaining two individuals who eat 2 eggs each day is $2 \times 2 = 4$ eggs per day.

Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day is $9 + 4 = 13$ eggs.

Since the family consumes eggs every day, the total number of eggs consumed in a week (7 days) is $13 \times 7 = 91$ eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{91}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a linear relationship between the ages of Trent, Jane, and Quinn. Let's denote Quinn's age as Q, Jane's age as J, and Trent's age as T. We are given that T = J + 5 and J = Q - 3.

Since we know Quinn's age is 30, we can substitute Q = 30 into the equation J = Q - 3 to find Jane's age. This yields J = 30 - 3 = 27.

Now, we can substitute J = 27 into the equation T = J + 5 to find Trent's age. This gives us T = 27 + 5 = 32.

Therefore, Trent's age is 32.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between the ages of Noah and Cera six years ago. Let's denote Noah's current age as N and Cera's current age as C. We are given that Cera is currently 46 years old, so C = 46.

Six years ago, Cera's age was C - 6 = 40, and Noah's age was N - 6. We are also given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so we can write the equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6)

Substituting C = 46 into this equation, we get:

N - 6 = (1/2)(40)
N - 6 = 20
N = 26

Now that we know Noah's current age, we can find the population of Chile six years ago. We are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so it was 3000(N - 6) = 3000(20) = 60000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population is twice the population six years ago, which is 2(60000) = 120000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120000}$"
"To determine the number of players on the defense, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D.

Given that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. Additionally, the number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, which is D/2.

The total number of players on the team is 105. Therefore, we can express this as an equation:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Now, we can solve for D by dividing both sides of the equation by 7:

D = 210/7

D = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the number of people attending Martha's Christmas party, we must first calculate the total number of individuals invited. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of families with 6 people by 6, and the number of families with 4 people by 4.

Let's denote the number of families with 6 people as $F_6$ and the number of families with 4 people as $F_4$. We are given that $F_6 = 2$ and $F_4 = 3$. Therefore, the total number of people invited is given by:

$Total\ people\ invited = (F_6 \times 6) + (F_4 \times 4)$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$Total\ people\ invited = (2 \times 6) + (3 \times 4) = 12 + 12 = 24$

However, 8 people were unable to attend due to illness. This reduces the total number of people to:

$Total\ people\ invited - 8 = 24 - 8 = 16$

Furthermore, 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't attend had previous commitments. This is equivalent to:

$\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2$ people

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't attend due to previous commitments is 2.

To find the number of people attending the party, we subtract the number of people who couldn't attend due to previous commitments from the total number of people who could attend:

$16 - 2 = 14$

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we must first calculate the total number of marbles. Initially, the store had 50 marbles. Solomon then acquired 20 marbles from Johanna, resulting in a total of 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.

Subsequently, Solomon's father gifted him 2/5 times the number of marbles he purchased from Johanna. To calculate this, we multiply the number of marbles purchased from Johanna (20) by 2/5:

$$\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{2 \times 20}{5} = \frac{40}{5} = 8$$

Therefore, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. The total number of marbles in the store is now 70 + 8 = 78.

Given that each marble weighs 2 kilograms, we can calculate the total weight of the marbles by multiplying the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble:

$$78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To determine the cost of filling the pool, we must first calculate its volume. The pool is a rectangular prism, and its volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = L × W × H

where V is the volume, L is the length, W is the width, and H is the height of the pool.

Given the dimensions of the pool:

L = 6 feet
W = 4 feet
H = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

V = L × W × H = 6 × 4 × 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost per cubic foot is $0.1. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated as:

Total cost = V × Cost per cubic foot
= 120 × $0.1
= $12

The final answer is: $12"
"Given the problem statement, we can model the number of children in the classroom using a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of boys as B, the number of girls as G, and the number of nongendered children as N.

We are given that the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, which can be expressed as:
G = 3B

We are also given that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, which can be expressed as:
N = (1/10)B

Furthermore, we are given that the classroom has 30 boys, so we can substitute this value into the equations:
B = 30
G = 3B = 3(30) = 90
N = (1/10)B = (1/10)(30) = 3

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we can add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total children = B + G + N = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123.

P : W = 1 : 3

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. To find the number of electric poles required, we can set up a proportion using the given ratio:

P / W = 1 / 3
P / 45 = 1 / 3

To solve for P, we can cross-multiply:

3P = 45
P = 45 / 3
P = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"Given the scenario, we can approach this problem by first determining the total number of people who left the party. We know that 1/4 of the initial 40 people left, which can be calculated as follows:

$$\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10$$

This means that 10 people left the party. Since we are given that 22 men stayed at the party, we can determine the number of men who left as follows:

$$25 - 22 = 3$$

Since 3 men left, the number of women who left is the difference between the total number of people who left (10) and the number of men who left (3):

$$10 - 3 = 7$$

Now, we can find the number of women who remained at the party by subtracting the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

$$15 - 7 = 8$$

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a series of relationships between the costs of the magazine, book, and pen. Let's denote the cost of the book as B, the cost of the magazine as M, and the cost of the pen as P.

We are given that the magazine costs half as much as the book, which can be expressed as M = B/2. We also know that the book costs $4, so B = $4. Substituting this value into the equation for the magazine's cost, we get M = $4/2 = $2.

Furthermore, we are told that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. This relationship can be expressed as P = M - $1. Substituting the value of M, we get P = $2 - $1 = $1.

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we first need to calculate the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes of pencils, each containing 8 pencils (as we will derive below), and 2 loose pencils, totaling 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils.

First, let's calculate the number of pencils in each box. We can set up an equation to represent the total number of pencils Jam has:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 x 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the weakening of the iced coffee, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

Let's denote the initial volume of the coffee as V. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and weakens it by 12 milliliters. We want to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, so the number of ice cubes required can be calculated as follows:

Number of ice cubes = (Initial temperature - Final temperature) / Cooling effect per ice cube
= (100 - 35) / 13
= 65 / 13
= 5

The weakening caused by the ice cubes is then given by the product of the number of ice cubes and the weakening effect per ice cube:

Weakening due to ice cubes = Number of ice cubes * Weakening effect per ice cube
= 5 * 12
= 60 milliliters

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the cream:

Total weakening = Weakening due to ice cubes + Weakening due to cream
= 60 + 15
= 75 milliliters

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"Given the scenario, we can model the problem as a ratio of old records to new records. The ratio is 2:1, indicating that 2 old records are traded for 1 new record. Let's denote the number of new records as $n$ and the number of old records as $o$. We are given that the total number of new records is 7, so $n = 7$. We can express the number of old records in terms of the number of new records as $o = 2n$.

Substituting $n = 7$ into the equation, we get $o = 2(7) = 14$. However, this represents the total number of old records traded. Since there are 5 people, we can find the number of old records each person brought in by dividing the total number of old records by the number of people.

Number of old records per person = $\frac{o}{5} = \frac{14}{5} = 2.8$

Since we cannot trade a fraction of a record, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are interested in the total number of old records, so we can multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people.

Total number of old records = Number of old records per person $\times$ Number of people
Total number of old records = $2.8 \times 5 = 14$

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total amount of money the company pays to all programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can express this as a mathematical equation:

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) × Total number of employees

Substituting the given value of the total number of employees (100), we get:

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) × 100
= 2 × 20
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers. The salary of junior programmers is given as $2000 per month. Therefore:

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers × Salary of junior programmers
= 40 × $2000
= $80,000

Next, we need to find the salary of senior programmers. It is given that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. Therefore:

Salary of senior programmers = Salary of junior programmers + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers:

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers × Salary of senior programmers
= 60 × $2400
= $144,000

Finally, we can find the total amount paid to all programmers by adding the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers:

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80,000 + $144,000
= $224,000

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were x people on the bus. 
At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5. 
At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2. 
Then, 8 more people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6. 
We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, we can apply a step-by-step approach, utilizing basic arithmetic operations.

Initially, Oscar possesses 24 lollipops. Upon consuming 2 on his way to school, the number of lollipops remaining is given by:

24 - 2 = 22

Subsequently, Oscar distributes 14 lollipops to his friends, resulting in:

22 - 14 = 8

Next, Oscar purchases twice the number of lollipops he distributed, which is 2 * 14 = 28. Therefore, the total number of lollipops he now has is:

8 + 28 = 36

Following this, Oscar consumes 3 lollipops that night, leading to:

36 - 3 = 33

Lastly, he consumes 2 more lollipops in the morning, yielding:

33 - 2 = 31

Thus, Oscar is left with 31 lollipops.

The final numerical answer is: 31"
"To determine the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we first need to calculate the remaining charge percentage. Given that the phone is currently at 60% charged, the remaining charge is 100% - 60% = 40%.

The charging rate is 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find the time it takes to charge 40%, we can use the formula:

Time = (Remaining Charge) / (Charging Rate)

Substituting the values, we get:

Time = 40% / (1 percentage-point / 3 minutes)

To simplify the expression, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

Time = (40/100) / (1/3)

Time = 0.4 / (1/3)

Time = 0.4 * 3

Time = 1.2 hours

Therefore, it will take 1.2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.2}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Erin has left, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. Initially, Erin possesses 7 lollipops. Her mother subsequently donates 10 additional lollipops, resulting in a total of 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Subsequently, Erin relinquishes 3 lollipops to Ella. To calculate the remaining number of lollipops, we subtract 3 from the total: 17 - 3 = 14.

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops remaining.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Given the customer's loyalty card rewards structure, we can calculate the amount paid on the current shopping trip by first determining the rewards earned from the last shopping trip. The customer spent $80 on the last shopping trip, which yields a rewards value of $80 / $20 = 4 rewards.

On the current shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. The rewards earned from the last shopping trip are $4, and the coupon discount is twice this amount, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total discount applied to the current shopping trip is the sum of the rewards and the coupon discount, which is $4 + $8 = $12.

To find the amount paid, we subtract the total discount from the amount spent on the current shopping trip: $43 - $12 = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine which job offers a higher net pay, we must consider the total income, property tax, and income tax for each position.

Job A:
- Total income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
- Since no property tax is mentioned for Job A, we can proceed with the income tax calculation.
- Income tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Total income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Income tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

To find the difference in net pay, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To determine the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we first need to calculate the proportion of ruined castles. Given that 40% of the 220 castles in Scotland are ruins, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 40 by 100.

40% = 40/100 = 0.4

Now, we can calculate the number of ruined castles by multiplying the total number of castles by this decimal.

Number of ruined castles = 0.4 * 220
= 88

Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we can find the number of unmanned ruined castles by dividing the number of ruined castles by 2.

Number of unmanned ruined castles = 88 / 2
= 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost of each offer, taking into account the advance payment and the monthly installments.

Let's denote the total cost of Furniture United's offer as CU and the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer as CH. We can express these costs as follows:

CU = AP + (M \* I)
CH = AP + (M \* I)

where AP is the advance payment, M is the number of monthly installments, and I is the monthly installment amount.

For Furniture United's offer:
- AP = $1,350
- M = 6
- I = $350
CU = $1,350 + (6 \* $350)
CU = $1,350 + $2,100
CU = $3,450

For Cozy Homes' offer:
- AP = $1,100
- M = 9
- I = $250
CH = $1,100 + (9 \* $250)
CH = $1,100 + $2,250
CH = $3,350

Now, we can calculate the cost difference between the two offers by subtracting the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer from the total cost of Furniture United's offer:

ΔC = CU - CH
ΔC = $3,450 - $3,350
ΔC = $100

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine the equitable distribution of paintball guns among the individuals, we must first calculate the total number of guns available. This can be achieved by summing the individual quantities of guns possessed by each person.

Let's denote the number of guns as follows:
- DJ: 8 guns
- Nick: 10 guns
- RJ: 1 gun
- Richard: 5 guns

The total number of guns is the sum of these individual quantities:
Total number of guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

Now, to find the number of guns each person would have if they were shared equally, we divide the total number of guns by the number of individuals.

Number of people = 4

Equitable distribution of guns = Total number of guns / Number of people
= 24 / 4
= 6

Therefore, each person would have 6 guns if the guns were shared equally."
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge, we can apply the principles of linear algebra and combinatorial arithmetic.

Let's denote the amount of sugar needed for a batch of suckers as S and the amount of sugar needed for a batch of fudge as F. We are given that S = 30 ounces and F = 70 ounces.

To find the total amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge, we can use the following equation:

Total sugar = (8S) + F

Substituting the given values, we get:

Total sugar = (8 * 30) + 70

Using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can rewrite the equation as:

Total sugar = 240 + 70

Now, we can add the two values to find the total amount of sugar needed:

Total sugar = 310

Therefore, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

The final answer is: 310"
"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we can apply the concept of percentage changes to the initial stock price. 

Let's denote the initial price of each share as $8. The stock price increases by 50% in the first year, which can be calculated as follows:

Initial price = $8
Increase in the first year = 50% of $8 = 0.5 \* $8 = $4
Price after the first year = Initial price + Increase = $8 + $4 = $12

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%, which can be calculated as follows:

Decrease in the second year = 25% of $12 = 0.25 \* $12 = $3
Price after the second year = Price after the first year - Decrease = $12 - $3 = $9

Since Maria buys 8 shares, the total value of her shares after the second year can be calculated as follows:

Total value = Number of shares \* Price after the second year
= 8 \* $9
= $72

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To determine the difference in the number of hot dogs consumed by John and Luke, we must first establish the quantities consumed by each individual. 

Let's denote the number of hot dogs Luke ate as L. Given that Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, the number of hot dogs Thomas consumed can be expressed as 3L. Since John ate half the amount Thomas ate, the number of hot dogs John consumed is (3L)/2.

We are given that Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Therefore, L = 2. Substituting this value into the expressions for Thomas and John's consumption, we get:

- Thomas ate 3L = 3(2) = 6 hot dogs.
- John ate (3L)/2 = (3(2))/2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find the difference in the number of hot dogs consumed by John and Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as x. Since the last group has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can express this as an equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining like terms, we get:

3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation yields:

3x = 210

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

x = 70

Now, to find the number of students in the last group, we subtract 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's analyze the problem using a systematic approach.

Given that Farmer Brown has 60 animals on his farm, consisting of chickens and cows, and that he has twice as many chickens as cows, we can establish a relationship between the number of chickens (H) and cows (C) as follows:

H = 2C

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, which implies that the sum of the number of chickens and cows is 60:

H + C = 60

Substituting H = 2C into the second equation, we get:

2C + C = 60

Combining like terms, we obtain:

3C = 60

To find the value of C, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

C = 60/3
C = 20

Now that we have the value of C, we can find the value of H by substituting C into the equation H = 2C:

H = 2(20)
H = 40

Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, the total number of legs of the chickens is 2H = 2(40) = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows is 4C = 4(20) = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is the sum of the legs of the chickens and cows:

Total legs = 80 + 80
Total legs = 160

Therefore, the total number of legs of all the animals on Farmer Brown's farm is 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the number of balls Josh has left to juggle after the talent show, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. This is an arithmetic sequence with a first term of 3 and a common difference of 1. The number of balls after 4 weeks can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:

a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d

where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, n is the number of terms, and d is the common difference.

Plugging in the values, we get:

a_5 = 3 + (5 - 1)1
a_5 = 3 + 4
a_5 = 7

So, Josh has 7 balls after 4 weeks of practice.

However, when Josh walks on stage, he drops 3 balls. Two of them are caught by people in the crowd, but one gets lost. This means he loses 1 ball.

To find the number of balls Josh has left, we subtract the number of balls lost from the total number of balls:

7 - 1 = 6

Therefore, Josh starts juggling with 6 balls.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the weights of the blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird as B, T, S, and R, respectively. We are given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, so we can express the relationships between the weights as follows:

1. B = 50 (since the blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog)
2. T = 50 (since the green toad weighs the same as the pink frog)
3. S = 50 + 10 = 60 (since the yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog)
4. R = 50 - 20 = 30 (since the red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog)

We are also given that the container weighs 20 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal can be expressed as:

Total weight = B + T + S + R + 20

Substituting the values of B, T, S, and R, we get:

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20
Total weight = 210

"To determine the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run based on his coach's advice.

Let's denote the original daily distance as $d = 5000$ meters. The coach wants Tyson to run $1/5$ times more meters in a day, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{5}d$. To find this value, we perform the following calculation:

$$\frac{1}{5}d = \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000$$

Therefore, the new daily distance is the sum of the original distance and the additional distance, which is $d + \frac{1}{5}d = 5000 + 1000 = 6000$ meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, the total distance covered in June can be calculated as the product of the new daily distance and the number of days:

$$\text{Total Distance} = 6000 \times 30 = 180,000 \text{ meters}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{180000}$"
"Given the scenario, we can establish the prices of the juice boxes as follows:

Let's denote the price of Juice Box A as $A$. We are given that Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so its price can be expressed as $A + 5$. Similarly, Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so its price is $A + 7$.

We are tasked with finding the difference between the prices of Juice Box C and Juice Box B. This can be calculated as follows:

Difference = Price of Juice Box C - Price of Juice Box B
= (A + 7) - (A + 5)
= A + 7 - A - 5

"To determine the total number of legs of the restaurant's tables, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of legs for the tables with 4 legs: 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs. 

Next, we calculate the total number of legs for the tables with 3 legs: 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs.

Now, we add the number of legs from both types of tables to obtain the total: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs.

The total number of legs of the restaurant's tables is 310."
"To determine the number of cookies Jenny eats, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, let's calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son. Since he eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, we can express this as a product of the daily consumption rate and the number of days: 4 cookies/day * 5 days = 20 cookies.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her husband. His daily consumption rate is 1 cookie, and he consumes cookies for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 1 cookie/day * 7 days = 7 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies consumed by both her son and husband by adding their individual consumptions: 20 cookies (son) + 7 cookies (husband) = 27 cookies.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 are used by her son and husband, we can find the number of cookies Jenny eats by subtracting the total consumption from the total number of cookies in the bag: 36 cookies - 27 cookies = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To determine the total cost of the shirts, we first need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 40% of the original price of $30.

Discount = 40% of $30
= 0.4 * $30
= $12

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to obtain the discounted price of one shirt.

Discounted price of one shirt = $30 - $12
= $18

Since Davos purchased 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2 to obtain the total cost.

Total cost = $18 * 2
= $36

Therefore, the total amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts is $36."
"To determine the percentage increase in revenue, we first need to calculate the original daily revenue from tractor sales and the current daily revenue from silo sales.

The original daily revenue from tractor sales is given by the product of the number of tractors sold and the price per tractor: 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day.

The current daily revenue from silo sales is given by the product of the number of silos sold and the price per silo: 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day.

The difference in daily revenue is $1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day.

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:

Percentage increase = ((New value - Original value) / Original value) * 100

Substituting the values, we get:

Percentage increase = (($1100 - $1000) / $1000) * 100
= ($100 / $1000) * 100
= 10%

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now compared to when they made tractors.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the annual expenditure on the dog, we must first calculate the monthly expenses and then multiply by 12. 

The cost of food per month can be calculated as follows:
Food cost per week = $25
Number of weeks in a month = 4
Food cost per month = 25 \* 4 = $100

The monthly expenses for the dog can be calculated by adding the cost of treats and medicine to the food cost:
Treats cost per month = $20
Medicine cost per month = $100
Total cost per month = 100 + 20 + 100 = $220

Now, we can calculate the annual expenditure by multiplying the total monthly cost by 12:
Total cost per year = 220 \* 12 = $2640

The final answer is: $2640"
"To determine the total time required for Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the duration of each event and sum them up.

First, let's identify the duration of each activity:

- Monday's yoga class: 1 hour
- Tuesday's cooking class: Since the cooking class lasts three times as long as Monday's yoga, we can express this as 3 × 1 = 3 hours
- Wednesday's cheese-tasting event: This event lasts for half an hour, which can be represented as 0.5 hours
- Thursday's museum tour: The museum tour takes half the time of the cooking class, so we can calculate this as 3 ÷ 2 = 1.5 hours
- Friday's errands: Peyton has 2 hours allocated for errands

Now, let's add up the time for all activities:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

Therefore, the total time required for Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7.5}$"
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots required for the garden and subtract that from the number she already purchased.

Let's denote the number of plant pots needed for the daisies as D and the number needed for the roses as R. We are given that D = 30 and R = 2D. Substituting the value of D, we get R = 2(30) = 60.

The total number of plant pots required is the sum of the pots needed for the daisies and the roses: T = D + R = 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April already purchased 100 plant pots, we can calculate the number of plant pots left over by subtracting the total number of plant pots required from the number she bought: P_left = 100 - 90 = 10.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount Andrea saved, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount Andrea saved as 'x'. 

Initially, Andrea had $36. After spending $11 on a sweater and giving her brother $4, she was left with $21. This can be represented by the equation:

36 - x - 11 - 4 = 21

Simplifying the equation, we get:

36 - x - 15 = 21

Combine like terms:

21 - x = 21

Subtract 21 from both sides:

-x = 0

Multiply both sides by -1:

x = 0

However, this result is counterintuitive, as it suggests Andrea saved nothing. Let's re-examine the equation and consider the possibility that the initial amount Andrea had was not $36, but rather the amount she saved plus the $11 sweater and the $4 given to her brother. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 11 + 4 = 36

Combine like terms:

x + 15 = 36

Subtract 15 from both sides:

x = 21

Therefore, Andrea saved $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the time John spent sightseeing, we can approach this problem by first calculating the total time spent on all activities and then finding the proportion of time allocated to sightseeing.

Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as $T$. The time spent boating is given as 6 hours, and the time spent swimming is half of that, which is $6/2 = 3$ hours. The time spent watching shows is 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours, resulting in a total of $3 \times 2 = 6$ hours.

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is $6 + 3 + 6 = 15$ hours. We are given that this accounts for 70% of the total time, as the remaining 30% is spent watching shows. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

$$0.30T = 15$$

Solving for $T$, we get:

$$T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50$$

Now that we have the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:

$$\text{Time spent sightseeing} = 0.40 \times T = 0.40 \times 50 = 20$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount Annabelle still needs to save for the phone, we must first calculate her total earnings from both jobs and then subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

Let's begin by calculating her earnings from the first job, where she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work:

$$
\text{Earnings from first job} = \text{hourly wage} \times \text{number of hours worked} = \$10 \times 20 = \$200
$$

Next, we calculate her earnings from the second job, where she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work:

$$
\text{Earnings from second job} = \text{hourly wage} \times \text{number of hours worked} = \$5 \times 15 = \$75
$$

Now, we can find her total earnings by adding her earnings from both jobs:

$$
\text{Total earnings} = \text{earnings from first job} + \text{earnings from second job} = \$200 + \$75 = \$275
$$

Since Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, we can find the amount she still needs to save by subtracting her total earnings from the cost of the phone:

$$
\text{Amount still needed} = \text{cost of phone} - \text{total earnings} = \$400 - \$275 = \$125
$$

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $125 to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $125"
"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the height of the shortest tree as $s$, the height of the second tree as $s + 5$, and the height of the tallest tree as $t$.

Given that the shortest tree has a height of 6 feet, we can set $s = 6$. The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so its height is $s + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11$ feet.

The combined height of the two shorter trees is $s + (s + 5) = 2s + 5$. Substituting the value of $s$, we get $2(6) + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17$ feet.

Now, we are given that the height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. Therefore, we can express this relationship as $t = 2(2s + 5)$. Substituting the value of $s$, we get $t = 2(2(6) + 5) = 2(12 + 5) = 2(17) = 34$ feet.

Thus, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the amount of money Dean has left, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Initially, Dean's mother provided him with $28. He then spent $12 on toy cars (6 toy cars * $2) and $5 on teddy bears (5 teddy bears * $1). The total amount spent is $12 + $5 = $17.

Subsequently, his mother gave him an additional $10, bringing the total amount he has to $28 + $10 = $38. To find the amount of money Dean has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the total amount he has: $38 - $17 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and subtract it from her dad's budget.

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

However, we need to subtract Morgan's cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 
To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.83 ≈ 1

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the arcade tokens in the cost per friend. The cost per friend is actually $30 + $5 = $35. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $35 = 1.57

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.57 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $55 - $5 = $50. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$50 / $35 = 1.43

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.43 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the go-karts in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $50 - $20 = $30.

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.29 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the arcade tokens in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $10 - $5 = $5. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$5 / $35 = 0.14

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.14 ≈ 0

"To determine the amount of money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate her daily savings and then multiply it by the number of days she saves.

First, let's calculate her daily savings. Marisa receives $5 as pocket money every day and spends $1 on 4 lollipops, each costing $0.25. Therefore, her daily savings can be calculated as follows:

Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Cost of lollipops
Daily savings = $5 - $1
Daily savings = $4

Now, we need to find the total savings over 5 days. This can be calculated by multiplying her daily savings by the number of days:

Total savings = Daily savings x Number of days
Total savings = $4 x 5
Total savings = $20

Therefore, Marisa saves $20 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the amount of candy Billy purchased, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the pounds of candy he bought as 'x'. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the total expenditure on candy is 1.5x.

Billy's initial capital is $10. After purchasing the candy, he has 10 - 1.5x dollars remaining. He then allocates half of this amount towards gumballs, which cost $0.05 each. Since he buys 40 gumballs, the total expenditure on gumballs is 40 \* 0.05 = $2.

We can express the amount spent on gumballs as half of the remaining capital after purchasing the candy, which is (10 - 1.5x)/2. Setting this equal to the cost of the gumballs, we have:

$$\frac{10 - 1.5x}{2} = 2$$

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction yields:

$$10 - 1.5x = 4$$

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

$$-1.5x = -6$$

Dividing both sides by -1.5, we find:

$$x = 4$$

Therefore, Billy purchased 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the age of Carver's son, we can establish an equation based on the given information. Let 'x' represent the son's age. According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice the son's age. This relationship can be expressed as:

2x - 5 = 45

To solve for 'x', we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

2x - 5 + 5 = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to isolate 'x':

(2x) / 2 = 50 / 2
x = 25

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the number of days between services for the train, we first need to calculate the total distance traveled in one trip and then divide that by the service interval.

The distance between the first and second cities is 75 miles, the distance between the second and third cities is 100 miles, and the distance between the third and first cities is 50 miles less than the sum of the first two distances. Therefore, the distance between the third and first cities is $75 + 100 - 50 = 125$ miles.

The total distance traveled in one trip is the sum of the distances between the three cities: $75 + 100 + 125 = 300$ miles.

Since the train travels this route three times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is $3 \times 300 = 900$ miles.

The train requires service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance traveled: $\frac{18,000}{900} = 20$ days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount of stuffing required for Mark's custom dog beds, we need to calculate the amount needed for each type of bed and then sum the total.

First, let's establish the amount of stuffing required for each type of bed. A bed for a Rottweiler requires 8 pounds of stuffing, while a bed for a chihuahua requires 2 pounds. The amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing required for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed. This can be calculated as follows:

Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of stuffing required for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 

Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To determine the total duration of John's trip, we must first calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey. 

The distance to John's friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. Using the formula for time, $t = \frac{d}{s}$, where $t$ is time, $d$ is distance, and $s$ is speed, we can calculate the time taken to reach his friend's house as follows:

$$t_{\text{to friend's house}} = \frac{d_{\text{to friend's house}}}{s} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{40}{14} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours}.$$

However, John had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. Therefore, the total distance to his friend's house is 210 miles. The time taken to drive to his friend's house, including the detour, is:

$$t_{\text{to friend's house with detour}} = \frac{d_{\text{to friend's house with detour}}}{s} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{21}{7} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}.$$

Next, we calculate the time taken to drive back home. The distance is 240 miles, and the speed is 80 mph. Using the same formula, we get:

$$t_{\text{back home}} = \frac{d_{\text{back home}}}{s} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}.$$

The total time taken for the trip is the sum of the times for each leg:

$$t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{to friend's house with detour}} + t_{\text{back home}} = 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}.$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we can employ a straightforward approach using set theory and basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the total number of fourth-graders as $T$, the number of girls as $G$, the number of boys as $B$, and the number of absent students as $A$. We are given that $T = 96$, $G = 43$, and $A = 5 + 4 = 9$. 

We can calculate the number of students present on Friday as $T - A = 96 - 9 = 87$. Since we know that the number of girls present is $G - 5 = 43 - 5 = 38$, we can find the number of boys present by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students present: $87 - 38 = 49$.

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49.

The final answer is: $\boxed{49}$"

Total = G + 2G
Total = 3G
Total = 3(6)
Total = 18

Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test to pass, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the points scored on the third test as x.

Given that Jane must score at least 42 points in total, and she has already scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test, we can set up the following inequality:

15 + 18 + x ≥ 42

Combining like terms, we get:

33 + x ≥ 42

Subtracting 33 from both sides of the inequality yields:

x ≥ 9

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test to meet the minimum requirement.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of individuals kicked out of the Walmart for reasons other than refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, or physical violence, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach.

Let's denote the number of individuals kicked out for refusing to wear masks as $M$, the number of individuals kicked out for shoplifting as $S$, and the number of individuals kicked out for physical violence as $V$. We are given that $M = 3$.

The number of individuals kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of individuals kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5, which can be expressed as $S = 4M - 5$. Substituting the value of $M$, we get $S = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7$.

The number of individuals kicked out for physical violence is three times the number of individuals kicked out for shoplifting, which can be expressed as $V = 3S$. Substituting the value of $S$, we get $V = 3(7) = 21$.

We are also given that the total number of individuals kicked out is 50. Therefore, the number of individuals kicked out for other reasons, denoted as $O$, can be calculated as $O = 50 - (M + S + V)$. Substituting the values of $M$, $S$, and $V$, we get $O = 50 - (3 + 7 + 21) = 50 - 31 = 19$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine Erin's points before the given scenario, we can establish a relationship between Erin's and Sara's points. Let's denote Erin's points before as x. 

Given that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8, we can express Erin's current points as 3 * 8 = 24. However, we are given that Erin currently has 14 points. 

We can set up an equation to represent the relationship between Erin's points before and after the given scenario:

x + 14 = 24

To find Erin's points before, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation:

x = 24 - 14
x = 10

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before the given scenario.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. Therefore, the total cost of the picture frames is:

44 \* $20 = $880

Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the logo on each frame. The etching costs 20% of the frame's cost, which is $20. To find 20% of $20, we multiply $20 by 0.20:

$20 \* 0.20 = $4

Since there are 44 frames, the total cost of etching is:

44 \* $4 = $176

Now, we add the cost of the picture frames and the etching to get the total cost of the picture frames and etching:

$880 + $176 = $1056

In addition to the picture frames and etching, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. Therefore, the total cost of the pins is:

2 \* $5 = $10

Furthermore, 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 11 seniors. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. Therefore, the total cost of the cords is:

11 \* $12 = $132

Finally, we add the cost of the picture frames and etching, the pins, and the cords to get the total cost of the senior gifts:

$1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198

The final answer is: $1198"
"To determine the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we must first calculate the materials cost, which is the original cost minus the savings from making it yourself.

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

The savings from making it yourself is 20% of the original cost, which can be calculated as follows:

Savings = 0.20 \* $400
Savings = $80

Therefore, the materials cost is the original cost minus the savings:

Materials Cost = Original Cost - Savings
Materials Cost = $400 - $80
Materials Cost = $320

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we can break down the problem into manageable components.

Let's denote the number of pairs sold on Friday as $F$, the number of pairs sold on Saturday as $S$, and the number of pairs sold on Sunday as $U$. We are given that $F = 14$.

On Saturday, the store sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, so $S = 2F = 2(14) = 28$.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, so $U = \frac{1}{2}S = \frac{1}{2}(28) = 14$.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 6 from the total number of pairs sold on Sunday to account for the returns. Therefore, the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday is $U - 6 = 14 - 6 = 8$.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pairs sold by adding the number of pairs sold on each day: $F + S + (U - 6) = 14 + 28 + 8 = 50$.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we can multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold:
$50 \times 2 = 100$

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the total hours of dance practice per week, we can calculate the hours for each day and then sum them up.

Hallie's dance practice schedule consists of 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. On Saturdays, her practice is twice as long as the Tuesday session, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total hours of dance practice per week by adding the hours from each day: 1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours.

Therefore, Hallie has 5 hours of dance practice per week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to calculate the value of the faulty pieces and subtract it from the total amount spent.

Given that the total amount spent is $400,000 and the value of the faulty pieces is 40% of the total amount, we can express this as a mathematical equation:

Total Amount Spent = Value of Functioning Pieces + Value of Faulty Pieces

We know that the value of the faulty pieces is 40% of the total amount spent, which can be represented as:

Value of Faulty Pieces = 0.4 × Total Amount Spent

Substituting the given value of the total amount spent, we get:

Value of Faulty Pieces = 0.4 × $400,000 = $160,000

Now, we can find the value of the functioning pieces by subtracting the value of the faulty pieces from the total amount spent:

Value of Functioning Pieces = Total Amount Spent - Value of Faulty Pieces
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

Therefore, the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To determine the total milk collected by Mary, we can break down the problem into two parts: the milk collected from the first half of the sheep and the milk collected from the other half.

Let's denote the number of sheep as $n$. Since Mary has 30 sheep, we have $n = 30$. The milk collected from the first half of the sheep is given by $\frac{n}{2} \cdot 1 = \frac{30}{2} \cdot 1 = 15$ kg. Similarly, the milk collected from the other half of the sheep is given by $\frac{n}{2} \cdot 2 = \frac{30}{2} \cdot 2 = 30$ kg.

The total milk collected is the sum of the milk from the two halves, which is $15 + 30 = 45$ kg.

Therefore, Mary collects $\boxed{45}$ kg of milk every day."
"To determine the number of pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we establish the initial number of rolls, which is a dozen, denoted as 12. After feeding her 6 children, we subtract the number of rolls consumed from the initial quantity to find the remaining rolls: 12 - 6 = 6.

Next, we consider the number of pieces each remaining roll was broken into, which is 8. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of remaining rolls by the number of pieces per roll: 6 rolls * 8 pieces/roll = 48 pieces.

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we can employ a straightforward approach by first identifying the number of pupils who like blue and then subtracting that from the total number of pupils to find the remaining pupils who like green and yellow.

Given that half of the class likes blue, we can express this as:

Number of pupils who like blue = Total number of pupils / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

The remaining pupils who do not like blue are 40 - 20 = 20.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, which can be calculated as:

Number of pupils who like green = (Total number of remaining pupils) / 4
= 20 / 4
= 5

Now, to find the number of pupils who like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:

Number of pupils who like yellow = Total number of pupils - (Number of pupils who like blue + Number of pupils who like green)
= 40 - (20 + 5)
= 40 - 25
= 15

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15."
"To determine the total number of apples picked over the three days, we can start by analyzing the revenue generated from the apples sold on Monday. Given that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday and earned $56 at a price of $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples picked on that day as follows:

Let x be the number of apples picked on Monday. Then, the revenue equation can be expressed as:

Revenue = Price per apple × Number of apples
$56 = $4x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by $4:

x = $56 ÷ $4
x = 14

Therefore, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 × 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked on each day:

Total apples = Apples picked on Monday + Apples picked on Tuesday + Apples picked on Wednesday
Total apples = 14 + 12 + 24
Total apples = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we must first calculate the total number of socks she has washed. Since she washed 10 pairs of socks, we can calculate the total number of socks from the pairs as follows:

10 pairs of socks = 10 x 2 = 20 socks

Additionally, she washed 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks Lindsay has washed is:

20 socks (from pairs) + 15 socks (loose) = 35 socks

Now, to find the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks that need washing:

50 (total socks) - 35 (socks washed) = 15

Therefore, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"To determine the number of cookies left for Rachel, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. Initially, Rachel possesses 23 cookies. Subsequently, she receives 42 cookies from Janet, resulting in a total of 23 + 42 = 65 cookies.

However, her brother consumes 44 cookies, which necessitates a subtraction from the total. Therefore, the number of cookies left for Rachel can be calculated as follows:

65 (total cookies) - 44 (cookies eaten by brother) = 21

Thus, the number of cookies left for Rachel is 21.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the monthly payment, we can utilize the formula for calculating the monthly payment (M) on a loan, which is given by:

M = P[r(1 + r)^n]/[(1 + r)^n - 1]

where:
- P is the principal amount ($3,650)
- r is the monthly interest rate (10%/year / 12 months/year = 0.008333)
- n is the number of payments (5 months)

However, since the interest rate is relatively low and the loan period is short, we can approximate the monthly payment using the formula for simple interest:

M = P + (P * r * n)

First, we calculate the total interest:
I = P * r * n
= $3,650 * 0.008333 * 5
= $152.49

Then, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount to be paid:
Total Amount = P + I
= $3,650 + $152.49
= $3,802.49

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
M = Total Amount / n
= $3,802.49 / 5
= $760.50

The final answer is: $760.50"
"To determine the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe, we first calculate the distance each individual covered. Cho's speed was 14 kilometers per hour, and she hiked for 8 hours. Using the formula for distance, which is speed multiplied by time (d = rt), we can calculate Cho's distance as follows:

d = rt
d = 14 km/h * 8 h
d = 112 km

Next, we calculate Chloe's distance. Her speed was 9 kilometers per hour, and she hiked for 5 hours. Using the same formula, we can calculate Chloe's distance as follows:

d = rt
d = 9 km/h * 5 h
d = 45 km

To find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance:

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
Difference = 112 km - 45 km
Difference = 67 km

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

The final answer is: $\boxed{67}$"
"To determine the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they possess.

Let's denote the number of silver pesos Axel has as S_A = 50 and the number of gold pesos he has as G_A = 80. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so the number of silver pesos she has is S_A = 2S_A = 2 * 50 = 100. 
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so the number of gold pesos she has is G_A + 40 = 80 + 40 = 120.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is S_A + S_A = 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is G_A + (G_A + 40) = 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is (S_A + S_A) + (G_A + (G_A + 40)) = 150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To determine the profit per hour that Millie makes from her lemonade stand, we need to calculate the total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Since Millie sells each cup of lemonade for $1 and she can make 36 cups of lemonade (3 pitchers * 12 cups per pitcher), the total revenue is given by the equation:

Total Revenue = Number of Cups * Price per Cup
Total Revenue = 36 cups * $1/cup = $36

Next, we need to calculate the total cost, which is the cost of the supplies. The cost of the supplies is $18.

Now, we can calculate the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Total Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Total Profit = $36 - $18
Total Profit = $18

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she can make 36 cups in total, the number of hours she spends selling all the lemonade is given by the equation:

Number of Hours = Total Cups / Cups per Hour
Number of Hours = 36 cups / 4 cups/hour
Number of Hours = 9 hours

Finally, we can calculate the profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours:

Profit per Hour = Total Profit / Number of Hours
Profit per Hour = $18 / 9 hours
Profit per Hour = $2/hour

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can set up the equation:

$$\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8$$

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

$$x = 12.8 \cdot \frac{5}{2}$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$x = 32$$

Therefore, the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had is 32 hectares.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"Given that the choir consists of 52 members, with a 50% male and 50% female distribution, we can calculate the number of female members as follows:

Let $M$ denote the number of male members and $F$ denote the number of female members. We are given that $M = F = 0.5 \times 52 = 26$.

Since the choir decides to perform with just its female members, we are interested in the number of female members. However, on the day of the performance, half the people performing cannot make it to the show due to their bus breaking down. This implies that $\frac{1}{2}F$ female members are unable to perform.

Let $N$ denote the number of female members who are able to perform. Then, we have:

$$N = F - \frac{1}{2}F = \frac{1}{2}F = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13$$

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is the sum of the number of female members who are able to perform and the number of teachers:

$$\text{Total number of people who sang} = N + 3 = 13 + 3 = 16$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

"To determine the total number of messages James delivers, we can utilize a straightforward arithmetic approach. Given that James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson, and 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu, we can calculate the number of messages to Mr. Yu by multiplying the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) × 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can find the total number of messages James delivers by adding the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

"To determine the amount of money David saves by purchasing a ride bracelet instead of individual ride tickets, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Let's denote the cost of a single ride ticket as $2 and the number of rides as 9. The total cost for Dasha to ride all 9 rides using individual tickets is given by the product of the cost per ride and the number of rides:

$$\text{Cost for Dasha} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \times 2 = 36$$

On the other hand, David purchases a ride bracelet for $30, which grants him access to 9 rides. Therefore, the cost for David is simply the cost of the ride bracelet:

$$\text{Cost for David} = 30$$

To find the amount of money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha:

$$\text{Savings} = \text{Cost for Dasha} - \text{Cost for David} = 36 - 30 = 6$$

Therefore, David saves $6 by purchasing a ride bracelet instead of individual ride tickets.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the amount of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts. 

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts: 
6 (family) + 4 (friends) + 2 (teachers) = 12 gifts

Now, let's divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

This calculation assumes that the ribbon is used uniformly for each gift bow, without any waste or excess. In a real-world scenario, there may be some variation in the amount of ribbon used for each bow, depending on the size and design of the bow. However, for the purpose of this calculation, we can assume a uniform distribution of ribbon.

"Given the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, we can express this as a fraction, 5/11, representing the proportion of popsicles each person has. The total number of popsicles they have together is 165. To find the number of popsicles each person has, we can use the concept of weighted averages.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as B and the number of popsicles Sam has as S. We can set up the following equation based on the given ratio:

B/S = 5/6

We also know that the total number of popsicles is 165, so we can write the equation:

B + S = 165

To solve for B and S, we can use the substitution method. From the first equation, we can express B as (5/6)S. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

(5/6)S + S = 165

Combine like terms:

(11/6)S = 165

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction:

11S = 990

Divide both sides by 11:

S = 90

Now that we have found S, we can find B by substituting S into one of the original equations:

B = (5/6)S
B = (5/6)(90)
B = 75

Now, let's find the difference in the number of popsicles between Sam and Betty:

Difference = S - B
Difference = 90 - 75
Difference = 15

"To determine the cost savings of canceling the cable subscription and opting for streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus individually is $10 each, but since Tim bundles them, he receives a 20% discount. To calculate the discount, we can use the following formula:

Discount = (Discount Rate) × (Original Price)
Discount = 0.20 × $20
Discount = $4

The bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is the original price minus the discount:
Bundled Cost = Original Price - Discount
Bundled Cost = $20 - $4
Bundled Cost = $16

The total cost of the streaming services is the sum of the cost of Netflix and the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
Total Cost = Cost of Netflix + Bundled Cost
Total Cost = $10 + $16
Total Cost = $26

To find the cost savings, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
Cost Savings = Cost of Cable Package - Total Cost of Streaming Services
Cost Savings = $60 - $26
Cost Savings = $34

Therefore, Tim saves $34 by canceling his cable subscription and opting for streaming services.

The final answer is: $34"
"To determine the percentage of time spent editing, we first need to calculate the total time spent on the song. The time spent writing is 4 hours, the time spent recording is half of that, which is 2 hours, and the time spent editing is 90 minutes, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours.

Total time spent = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we can use the formula:

Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time spent) × 100

Substituting the values, we get:

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) × 100

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 0.5:

Percentage of time spent editing = (3 / 15) × 100

Now, we can simplify the fraction further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

Percentage of time spent editing = (1 / 5) × 100

To convert the fraction to a percentage, we can multiply the numerator by 100 and divide by the denominator:

Percentage of time spent editing = (1 × 100) / 5 = 20%

Therefore, the percentage of time spent editing is 20%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"

The capacity of the shelving system is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Next, we need to find double the number of books in the shelving system. This can be calculated as 2 * 36 = 72 books.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so we add 20 to the result: 72 + 20 = 92 books.

Therefore, Wendy needs to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"To determine the current number of Valentine's Day cards Erica possesses, we must first calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards her father brought, and then account for the cards she distributed and received.

Erica initially had 20 Valentine's cards. Her father brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, each containing 15 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards her father brought is 2 * 15 = 30.

Combining the initial number of cards Erica had with the cards her father brought, we get 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

Erica then distributed 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, resulting in a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards given away.

Subtracting the cards Erica distributed from the total number of cards she had, we get 50 - 29 = 21 cards remaining.

Finally, Erica received 17 cards from family and friends, so the current number of cards she possesses is 21 + 17 = 38.

The final numerical answer is: 38"
"To determine the number of slices left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices given away by Jenny. 

Let's denote the total number of slices as $n$. Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is $\frac{1}{3}n$, and 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is $\frac{1}{4}n$. 

The total number of slices given away is the sum of the slices given to Bill and Mark, which is $\frac{1}{3}n + \frac{1}{4}n$. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12. Therefore, the total number of slices given away is $\frac{4}{12}n + \frac{3}{12}n = \frac{7}{12}n$.

We are given that the total number of slices is 12, so $n = 12$. Therefore, the total number of slices given away is $\frac{7}{12} \cdot 12 = 7$.

Jenny also eats 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gives away and eats is 7 + 2 = 9.

The number of slices left is $n - 9 = 12 - 9 = 3$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of days Mark must save to purchase the bike, we can employ a straightforward financial planning approach. Given that Mark earns a daily income of $10 and desires to acquire a bike costing $300, we can calculate the required time frame using the following formula:

Number of days = Total amount required / Daily income

In this scenario, the total amount required is the cost of the bike, which is $300, and the daily income is $10.

Number of days = $300 / $10
= 30

Therefore, Mark must save for 30 days to accumulate the necessary funds to purchase the bike.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total number of bugs in Nancy's woodshed, we can break down the problem into manageable components. Let's denote the number of spiders as S, millipedes as M, and stink bugs as T.

Given that the number of spiders (S) is 90, we can express the number of millipedes (M) as 1/3 of S, which is M = (1/3)S. Substituting the value of S, we get M = (1/3)(90) = 30.

Next, we are told that the number of stink bugs (T) is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12, which can be expressed as T = 2M - 12. Substituting the value of M, we get T = 2(30) - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48.

To find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs: S + M + T = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

Therefore, the total number of bugs in Nancy's woodshed is 168.

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"Given the problem statement, we can establish a linear relationship between the ages of the three individuals. Let's denote Erica's age as E, Beth's age as B, and Alice's age as A. We are given the following information:

1. A = B + 7
2. B = E + 5
3. E = 30

Substituting equation (3) into equation (2), we get:

B = 30 + 5
B = 35

Now, substituting the value of B into equation (1), we get:

A = 35 + 7
A = 42

To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age:

A - E = 42 - 30
A - E = 12

Therefore, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total calories consumed by John, we must first calculate the total volume of milk he drank. Given that each glass of milk is 8 ounces and John consumed 2 glasses, the total volume of milk is 2 × 8 = 16 ounces.

Since milk contains 3 calories per ounce, we can calculate the total calories consumed by multiplying the total volume of milk by the calories per ounce: 16 ounces × 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories.

Therefore, the total calories consumed by John is 48 calories.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the annual earnings of the builder, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the total number of days he works in a year.

First, let's calculate the total number of days he works in a year. Since he works 4 weeks every month and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of weeks he works in a year is 4 * 12 = 48 weeks. Given that he works 6 days every week, the total number of days he works in a year is 48 * 6 = 288 days.

Now, let's find his daily earnings. He gets paid $50 every day. Therefore, his daily earnings can be represented as $50.

To find his total earnings in a year, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he works in a year:

Total earnings = $50 * 288

Using the distributive property of multiplication, we can rewrite this expression as:

Total earnings = 50 * 288
               = 50 * (24 * 12)
               = (50 * 24) * 12
               = 1200 * 12
               = 14400

Therefore, the builder's total earnings in a year is $14400.

The final answer is: $14400"
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we must first calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the amount of each ingredient by 4.

Total flour required = 4 × 3 cups = 12 cups
Total milk required = 4 × 1 cup = 4 cups

Given that flour is sold in 2-cup bags and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we can calculate the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy by dividing the total amount of each ingredient by the amount in each container.

Number of bags of flour = Total flour required ÷ Flour in each bag = 12 cups ÷ 2 cups/bag = 6 bags
Number of bottles of milk = Total milk required ÷ Milk in each bottle = 4 cups ÷ 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles

To find the difference between the number of bags of flour and the number of bottles of milk, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour.

Difference = Number of bags of flour - Number of bottles of milk = 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4 bags

Therefore, Mark needs to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the energy savings resulting from reducing the usage of a 900-watt air conditioner, we must first calculate the energy consumption per day and then subtract the new energy consumption from the original energy consumption.

The original energy consumption per day can be calculated as the product of the power rating of the air conditioner (900 watts) and the duration of usage (8 hours). This yields an energy consumption of 900 W * 8 h = 7200 Wh or 7.2 kWh.

If Mel reduces the usage time by 5 hours, the new energy consumption per day is 900 W * 3 h = 2700 Wh or 2.7 kWh.

The energy savings per day can be calculated as the difference between the original and new energy consumption: 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To determine the total energy savings over a period of 30 days, we multiply the daily energy savings by the number of days: 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

Therefore, the total energy savings over 30 days is 135 kWh.

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"To determine the average number of stripes on the zebras, we need to calculate the total number of stripes and divide it by the total number of zebras.

Let's denote the number of stripes on the two zebras with 17 stripes each as $2 \times 17 = 34$. The third zebra has 36 stripes. The fourth zebra has half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is $\frac{36}{2} = 18$.

The total number of stripes is the sum of the stripes on all four zebras: $34 + 36 + 18 = 88$.

The total number of zebras is 4.

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: $\frac{88}{4} = 22$.

Therefore, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 22.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese required for the muffaletta sandwiches, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people. Given that each sandwich serves 4 people, we can use the following equation:

Number of sandwiches = Total number of people / Number of people per sandwich
= 20 people / 4 people per sandwich
= 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, the total amount of each ingredient needed is:

Meat: 5 pounds
Cheese: 5 pounds

The cost of the meat is calculated as follows:

Cost of meat = Quantity of meat * Price per pound
= 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound
= $35.00

The cost of the cheese is calculated as follows:

Cost of cheese = Quantity of cheese * Price per pound
= 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound
= $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of their individual costs:

Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese
= $35.00 + $15.00
= $50.00

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people is $50.00."
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the initial relationship between the number of corns and cannolis in Allan's house. Let's denote the number of cannolis as C. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, the number of corns can be represented as 2C.

Given that Allan has a total of 40 cannolis, we can set up the equation:

C = 40

Now, we can find the initial number of corns by substituting the value of C into the expression for the number of corns:

Number of corns = 2C
= 2(40)
= 80

Next, Allan buys 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. This means he buys 60 cannolis and 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

To find the new total number of corns and cannolis, we add the initial quantities to the quantities purchased:

New total number of corns = Initial number of corns + Number of corns bought
= 80 + 20
= 100

New total number of cannolis = Initial number of cannolis + Number of cannolis bought
= 40 + 60
= 100

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is the sum of the new total number of corns and cannolis:

Combined total = New total number of corns + New total number of cannolis
= 100 + 100
= 200

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the total number of steps Elliott aims to walk as $T$, the steps completed before the jog as $S$, and the steps taken during the jog as $J$. We are given that $T = 10,000$, $S = 5,000$ (half of $T$) + $1,000$ (steps taken with a friend), and $T - S - J = 2,000$ (steps left after the jog).

First, we calculate the total steps completed before the jog: $S = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000$.

Next, we can express the equation $T - S - J = 2,000$ as $10,000 - 6,000 - J = 2,000$.

Simplifying the equation, we get $-J = 2,000 - 6,000$, which further simplifies to $-J = -4,000$.

Multiplying both sides by $-1$ to solve for $J$, we obtain $J = 4,000$.

Therefore, Elliott took $\boxed{4000}$ steps during his jog."
"To determine the time Toby will arrive at the airport, we must first calculate the time it takes for him to read the book. Given that the book contains 45 pages with 200 words per page, the total number of words is 45 × 200 = 9000 words.

Toby's reading rate is 300 words per minute. Therefore, the time required to read the book is 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes.

Additionally, it takes 10 minutes to travel to the airport. Consequently, the total time Toby will spend on reading and traveling is 30 minutes (reading) + 10 minutes (traveling) = 40 minutes.

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, we can calculate the time by which he will arrive early by subtracting the total time spent from the required arrival time: 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total amount paid in May. The company hired 40 employees, each working 40 hours a week for 4 weeks. The total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. Therefore, the total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount paid in June. Since 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. Therefore, the total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

$168,000"
"To determine the amount of money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased. The taffy was on sale with a promotion that can be expressed as a discount on the second pound. Specifically, the second pound is 50% off the regular price of $3. This can be calculated as $3 - (0.5 \* $3) = $3 - $1.50 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

In addition to the taffy, Sally purchased a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each. The total cost of the magnets is 4 \* $0.25 = $1.

The total cost of the items Sally bought is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so we can calculate the amount of money she has left by subtracting the total cost from her initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final numerical answer is: $3"
"To determine the total amount spent by Tim on fireworks, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework, then apply the discount.

Let's denote the cost of the first package of fireworks as $400 and the cost of the second package as $800, since it is twice the cost of the first package. The total cost of the fireworks is therefore $400 + $800 = $1200.

To calculate the discount, we need to find 20% of $1200, which is given by the expression 0.20 \* $1200 = $240. Subtracting this discount from the total cost of the fireworks yields the discounted cost: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150. Therefore, the total amount spent by Tim is the sum of the discounted cost of the fireworks and the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she will consume over a 30-day period. Given that she eats 2 cookies per night, we can calculate the total number of cookies as follows:

Total cookies = 2 cookies/night * 30 nights
Total cookies = 2 * 30
Total cookies = 60 cookies

Since Shannon's recipe yields 1 dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the number of dozens needed by dividing the total number of cookies by 12:

Number of dozens = Total cookies / 12
Number of dozens = 60 / 12
Number of dozens = 5

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to consider the intersection of two independent events: the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and the probability of a candle being more dangerous and potentially exploding.

Let's denote the total number of candles as $N = 50000$. The probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is $p_{\text{wet dog}} = 0.05$, and the probability of a candle being more dangerous and potentially exploding is $p_{\text{explode}} = 0.01$.

However, the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is conditional on it being more dangerous. Therefore, we need to find the probability of a candle being more dangerous and smelling like wet dog, denoted as $p_{\text{wet dog and explode}}$. This can be calculated using the formula for conditional probability:

$$p_{\text{wet dog and explode}} = p_{\text{wet dog}} \cdot \frac{p_{\text{explode | wet dog}}}{p_{\text{wet dog}}}$$

Since $p_{\text{wet dog}} = 0.05$ is the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog given that it is more dangerous, we can rewrite the formula as:

$$p_{\text{wet dog and explode}} = 0.05 \cdot \frac{0.01}{0.05}$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$p_{\text{wet dog and explode}} = 0.01$$

Now, we can find the expected number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode by multiplying the probability by the total number of candles:

$$N_{\text{wet dog and explode}} = p_{\text{wet dog and explode}} \cdot N = 0.01 \cdot 50000 = 500$$

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 500."
"To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which can be expressed as 0.3 * $20 = $6.

The discounted price of each blouse is then obtained by subtracting the discount amount from the regular price: $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is the product of the discounted price per blouse and the number of blouses purchased: 4 * $14 = $56.

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the information given. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as 'x'. We can then express the total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister as follows:

Let Jt be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees, Js be the number of apples she gathers from the shortest trees, and Ja be the number of apples she gathers from the average trees. Similarly, let St be the number of apples her sister gathers from the tallest trees, Ss be the number of apples she gathers from the shortest trees, and Sa be the number of apples she gathers from the average trees.

Given that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, we have Jt = 30. Since she gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, we have Js = 30/2 = 15. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so St = 2 * 30 = 60. Her sister also gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so Ss = 3 * 15 = 45.

We are also given that her sister does not gather any apples from the average trees, so Sa = 0.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is Jt + Js + Ja = 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x. The total number of apples gathered by her sister is St + Ss + Sa = 60 + 45 + 0 = 105.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, we can write the equation:

(45 + x) + 105 = 500

Now, let's solve for x:

45 + x + 105 = 500
x + 150 = 500
x = 350

Therefore, Joanne gathers 350 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We are given two pieces of information: the total number of heads (180) and the total number of bumps (304).

The first piece of information can be represented as an equation:

C + D = 180

The second piece of information can be represented as another equation, taking into account the fact that camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump:

2C + D = 304

We can solve this system of linear equations using the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation eliminates the variable D:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we have found the value of C, we can substitute it into the first equation to solve for D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, the number of dromedaries in the herd is 56.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To determine the total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the journey into distinct segments and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

First, let's consider the initial four days, during which Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. The total distance covered in this period is given by the product of the daily distance and the number of days:

$$\text{Distance}_\text{first 4 days} = 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}$$

Next, we examine the subsequent two days, during which Tom traveled 30% of the distance covered in the first four days. This can be calculated as follows:

$$\text{Distance}_\text{next 2 days} = 0.3 \times \text{Distance}_\text{first 4 days} = 0.3 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km}$$

On the following day, Tom did not travel at all, so the distance covered is zero.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. Since there are seven days in a week, the total distance covered in this period is:

$$\text{Distance}_\text{second week} = 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}$$

To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we sum the distances covered in each segment:

$$\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance}_\text{first 4 days} + \text{Distance}_\text{next 2 days} + \text{Distance}_\text{following day} + \text{Distance}_\text{second week}$$

$$\text{Total distance} = 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{3140}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a proportional relationship between the sizes of the lockers. Let's denote the size of Timothy's locker as T, Zack's locker as Z, and Peter's locker as P. We are given that P = 5 cubic inches.

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can express this relationship as:

Z = 4P

Substituting the given value of P, we get:

Z = 4(5) = 20 cubic inches

Now, we are told that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, which can be expressed as:

Z = (1/2)T

Substituting the value of Z, we get:

20 = (1/2)T

To solve for T, we can multiply both sides by 2:

T = 2(20) = 40 cubic inches

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the elevation at which Stanley's comb landed, we can subtract the distance it fell from his initial elevation. This is a straightforward application of basic arithmetic.

Let's denote Stanley's initial elevation as $S = 10,000$ feet and the distance the comb fell as $d = 4,000$ feet. The elevation at which the comb landed is then given by:

$$E_{comb} = S - d = 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 \text{ feet}$$

Now, to find the distance Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's current elevation. Let's denote Oliver's elevation as $O = 3,000$ feet. The distance Oliver must climb is then given by:

$$D_{climb} = E_{comb} - O = 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 \text{ feet}$$

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To determine the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we can apply a straightforward arithmetic operation. Let's denote the initial capital as C, the amount received from the first bank as B1, and the amount received from the second bank as B2.

Given that B1 = $4000 and B2 = 2 * B1 = 2 * $4000 = $8000, we can calculate the total amount received from the banks as B1 + B2 = $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Now, to find the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we add the initial capital to the amount received from the banks: C + (B1 + B2) = $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"To determine the number of cats left on the rock, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats arrived and carried away 5 cats each, resulting in a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cats being removed. This leaves us with 50 - 20 = 30 cats on the rock.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To calculate the number of cats that ran, we can multiply 3/5 by the remaining number of cats: $\frac{3}{5} \cdot 30 = 18$. 

Now, to find the number of cats left on the rock, we subtract the number of cats that ran from the remaining number of cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the service, we can break down the cost into three distinct periods based on the pricing structure.

The first period consists of 6 months at $8 per month, resulting in a total cost of $8 \* 6 = $48.

The second period spans 8 months at $12 per month, yielding a total cost of $12 \* 8 = $96.

The final period comprises the remaining 10 months at $14 per month, leading to a total cost of $14 \* 10 = $140.

To obtain the total cost for 2 years, we sum the costs of the three periods: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J.

Given that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can express this relationship as:

J = T - 6

We are also given that Cole saved a total of $6, with 1/3 of the savings coming from the jogger jeans and 2/3 from the tattered jeans. This can be represented as:

(1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6

To eliminate the fractions, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

J + 2T = 18

Now, we can substitute the expression for J from the first equation into the second equation:

(T - 6) + 2T = 18

Combine like terms:

3T - 6 = 18

Add 6 to both sides:

3T = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

T = 8

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans:

J = T - 6
= 8 - 6
= 2

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and sum them together. 

The capacity of the 4 buses can be calculated as 4 \* 60 = 240 employees. This is a straightforward application of the distributive property of multiplication.

Similarly, the capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 \* 30 = 180 employees, and the capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 \* 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we can add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570.

The final answer is: $\boxed{570}$"
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we must first establish the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as $B$. Since each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than each store-bought feeder, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is $B + 10$. 

Given that Lillian made 3 homemade feeders and bought 3 store-bought feeders, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is $3(B + 10)$, and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is $3B$.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted to the homemade and store-bought feeders, which is $3(B + 10) + 3B$. 

Simplifying the expression, we get $3B + 30 + 3B = 6B + 30$. 

We are given that each bird feeder attracts 20 birds until Lillian notices that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. This implies that the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 20, and the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 30. Therefore, $B = 20$.

Substituting $B = 20$ into the expression $6B + 30$, we get $6(20) + 30 = 120 + 30 = 150$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which is $4. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25, resulting in $1. Therefore, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

Next, we need to find the cost of the cake. The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is $4. To find half of $4, we divide $4 by 2, resulting in $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To determine the initial number of Pokémon cards Kenny had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the total number of cards as x.

Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, which means he sold 2/3 of the cards. Since he made $50 from selling the cards, and each card is sold for $1.5, we can set up the following equation:

$$\frac{2}{3}x \cdot 1.5 = 50$$

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to isolate x:

$$x = 50 \cdot \frac{3}{2}$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$x = 75$$

Therefore, Kenny started with 75 Pokémon cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog, we must first calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared by the caterer. 

Given that the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the number of hotdogs prepared for these 18 guests as 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs. 

For the remaining half of the guests (also 18), the caterer prepared 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs. 

Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, when 40 guests arrived, each wanting a second hotdog, the total number of hotdogs required is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, the shortage is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs. Consequently, 26 guests did not receive a second hotdog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we can start by calculating the number of letters in her sister's name. 

Let's denote the number of letters in Indras' name as $n$. We are given that $n = 6$. 

The number of letters in her sister's name is 4 more than half of the letters in Indras' name. Therefore, the number of letters in her sister's name is $\frac{n}{2} + 4 = \frac{6}{2} + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7$.

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is the sum of the number of letters in each name, which is $n + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the total cost of Charlotte's order, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations and percentage calculations.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. This involves adding the individual costs of the set of pot and pans, the set of mixing bowls, and the five separate utensils.

Let's denote the cost of the set of pot and pans as $P = 120.00, the cost of the set of mixing bowls as $B = 20.00, and the cost of the five separate utensils as $U = 5.00. The total cost before discount can be calculated as follows:

Total cost before discount = P + B + 5U
= 120.00 + 20.00 + 5(5.00)
= 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00
= 165.00

Next, we need to calculate the discount, which is 20% of the total cost before discount. This can be expressed as:

Discount = 0.20 × Total cost before discount
= 0.20 × 165.00
= 33.00

Now, we can calculate the total cost after the discount by subtracting the discount from the total cost before discount:

Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount
= 165.00 - 33.00
= 132.00

Therefore, the total cost of Charlotte's order after the 20% discount is $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To determine the amount of money Dora needs to purchase the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball, we must first calculate the total cost of the items she wishes to acquire. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. Therefore, the total cost of the items is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Dora has a total of $18, consisting of $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother. To find the amount of money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to purchase the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we must first establish the number of dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter slew. 

Prince Arthur, wielding a spear, slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who slew 100 dragons. The mathematical representation of this relationship is:

A = (3/4) * T

where A is the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew and T is the number of dragons Prince Thaddeus slew. Substituting the given value for T, we get:

A = (3/4) * 100
A = 75

Next, we need to find the number of dragons Prince Walter slew, which is twice the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew. This relationship can be represented as:

W = 2 * A

Substituting the value of A, we get:

W = 2 * 75
W = 150

Now, we can determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, which is one-fifth the number of dragons Prince Walter slew. This relationship can be represented as:

B = (1/5) * W

Substituting the value of W, we get:

B = (1/5) * 150
B = 30

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the amount of gasoline Josey needed to run her lawnmower, we must first calculate the volume of gas in one container and then find 1/4 of that volume.

Given that 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the volume of gas in one container as follows:

Volume of gas in one container = Total volume of gas / Number of containers
= 15 gallons / 5
= 3 gallons

Since 1 gallon is equivalent to 8 pints, we can convert the volume of gas in one container from gallons to pints by multiplying by 8:

Volume of gas in one container (in pints) = 3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon
= 24 pints

Now, we need to find 1/4 of the volume of gas in one container, which is the amount Josey needed to run her lawnmower:

Amount of gas needed = 1/4 * Volume of gas in one container
= 1/4 * 24 pints
= 6 pints

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of candy bars George purchased as x. The total amount spent on candy bars is then 0.75x dollars. 

Given that George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, we can express this as an equation:

0.99(5) = 1.20 + 0.75x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4.95 = 1.20 + 0.75x

Subtracting 1.20 from both sides of the equation yields:

3.75 = 0.75x

Dividing both sides by 0.75, we obtain:

x = 5

Therefore, George purchased 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we can employ a straightforward division operation. 

First, we calculate the number of lollipops Ray shared with his friends by subtracting the number he kept from the total. This can be expressed as:

Lollipops shared = Total lollipops - Lollipops kept
= 25 - 5
= 20

Next, we divide the number of lollipops shared by the number of friends to find out how many each friend received:

Lollipops per friend = Lollipops shared / Number of friends
= 20 / 4
= 5

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the principles of division and subtraction.

Given that the cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 equal pieces, we can calculate the weight of each piece by dividing the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces.

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Since Rory and her mom each consume a piece, the total weight of the cake they eat is equal to twice the weight of a single piece.

Total weight eaten = 2 * Weight of each piece
Total weight eaten = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we can subtract the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

Therefore, the weight of the remaining cake is 15 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of oranges each person will receive, we must first calculate the total number of oranges available for distribution. Sitti and Juris collectively possess 34 and 22 oranges, respectively. 

The total number of oranges can be calculated as follows:

Total oranges = Sitti's oranges + Juris's oranges
Total oranges = 34 + 22
Total oranges = 56

Next, we need to determine the total number of individuals who will be sharing the oranges. Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends will be participating in the distribution, resulting in a total of 8 individuals.

To find the number of oranges each person will receive, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of individuals:

Number of oranges per person = Total oranges / Total individuals
Number of oranges per person = 56 / 8
Number of oranges per person = 7

Therefore, each person will receive 7 oranges.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we must first calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

The cost of onions is a function of the quantity and unit price. Antoine requires 2 pounds of onions, but he wants to double this amount, so the quantity of onions needed is 2 * 2 = 4 pounds. Given that the onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Similarly, the cost of beef stock is a function of the quantity and unit price. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00. Therefore, the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of onions and beef stock, which is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, we can calculate the cost per serving by dividing the total cost of the ingredients by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

Therefore, the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup is $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the time difference in departure for Bernadette and Wayne, we can establish a relationship between their travel times. Let's denote the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater as $t_W$ and the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater as $t_B$. We are given that $t_B = 4t_W$.

Given that it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, we can express this as $t_W = 4$ minutes. Substituting this into the equation for Bernadette's travel time, we get $t_B = 4 \cdot 4 = 16$ minutes.

Since Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we can express her arrival time as $t_B - 5$. To find the time difference in departure, we need to find the time at which Bernadette should leave, which is $t_B - 5$ minutes before Wayne's arrival time, $t_W$. Therefore, Bernadette should leave $t_B - 5 - t_W$ minutes before Wayne.

Substituting the values of $t_B$ and $t_W$, we get $16 - 5 - 4 = 7$ minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"Given that the area of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 360 square feet and the length of his room is 3 yards, we can first convert the length to feet, as 1 yard is equivalent to 3 feet. Therefore, the length in feet is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Using the formula for the area of a rectangle, A = lw, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width, we can solve for the width:

A = lw
360 = 9w
w = 360 / 9
w = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room using the formula P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width:

P = 2(l + w)
P = 2(9 + 40)
P = 2(49)
P = 98 feet

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we can calculate the total number of beads each has. 

Let's denote the number of beads Elizabeth has as E and the number of beads Margareth has as M. Since each pack of beads contains 20 pieces, we can express the total number of beads each sister has as follows:

E = (1 pack of red beads) + (2 packs of clear beads)
E = 1 × 20 + 2 × 20
E = 20 + 40
E = 60

M = (3 packs of blue beads) + (4 packs of red beads)
M = 3 × 20 + 4 × 20
M = 60 + 80
M = 140

Now, we can find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
ΔM = M - E
ΔM = 140 - 60
ΔM = 80

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to consider the effects of the oven and the open window on the temperature.

The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. This can be represented by the equation:

ΔT_oven = 5 * t_oven

where ΔT_oven is the temperature increase due to the oven and t_oven is the time the oven is on in hours. Substituting t_oven = 3, we get:

ΔT_oven = 5 * 3 = 15 degrees

The window is open for 0.5 hours (30 minutes), and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. This can be represented by the equation:

ΔT_window = -2 * (t_window / 10)

where ΔT_window is the temperature decrease due to the open window and t_window is the time the window is open in hours. Substituting t_window = 0.5, we get:

ΔT_window = -2 * (0.5 / 10) = -0.5 degrees

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. The temperature increase due to the oven is 15 degrees, and the temperature decrease due to the open window is -0.5 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature of the house is:

T_final = T_initial + ΔT_oven + ΔT_window
= 40 + 15 - 0.5
= 54.5 degrees

The final answer is: $\boxed{54.5}$"
"To determine the time it took James to complete the run, we must first calculate his total time for the triathlon. Given that Jon's total time is 170 minutes and he won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Next, we need to find James' times for the swim and bike. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, his swim time is 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes. Additionally, James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so his bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we can calculate James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time: 180 - (36 + 85) = 180 - 121 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{59}$"
"To determine the length of Movie A, we can establish a sequence of relationships between the three movies. Let's denote the length of Movie C as $c$, Movie B as $b$, and Movie A as $a$. We are given that Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equivalent to 75 minutes. Therefore, we have:

$$c = 75 \text{ minutes}$$

We are also given that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so we can express the length of Movie B as:

$$b = c + 5$$

Substituting the value of $c$, we get:

$$b = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes}$$

Finally, we are told that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, we can express the length of Movie A as:

$$a = \frac{1}{4}b$$

Substituting the value of $b$, we get:

$$a = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 80 = 20 \text{ minutes}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount of change Michael has after purchasing hay for his horse, we must first calculate the distance the horse runs and the corresponding amount of hay consumed.

Given that the horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour (mph) for 30 minutes, we need to convert the time to hours. Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 30 minutes is equivalent to 0.5 hours.

The distance traveled by the horse can be calculated using the formula: distance = speed × time. Therefore, the distance traveled is 32 mph × 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse consumes 1/2 bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay consumed is 16 miles × 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 bails × $3/bail = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, totaling $30. To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final numerical answer is: $6"

Given that each glass requires 5 eggs, the total number of glasses that can be made is 50 ÷ 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the number of trays that can be filled is 10 ÷ 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the difference in points between Joey and Marcy after their respective turns in Scrabble, we need to calculate their updated scores.

Joey's initial score is 214 points. He scores 26 points during his turn, so his new score is given by:

Joey's score = 214 + 26
Joey's score = 240

Marcy's initial score is 225 points. She scores 10 points during her turn, so her new score is given by:

Marcy's score = 225 + 10
Marcy's score = 235

To find the difference in their scores, we subtract Marcy's score from Joey's score:

Difference = Joey's score - Marcy's score
Difference = 240 - 235
Difference = 5

Therefore, Joey is winning by 5 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the salesman's profit, we must first calculate the total revenue generated from the sale of the sneakers. The revenue from the flash sale on Monday can be calculated as follows:

Revenue from flash sale = Number of sneakers sold × Price per sneaker
= 17 × $20
= $340

Next, we calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store. Since there were 48 sneakers in the case initially and 17 were sold during the flash sale, the remaining number of sneakers is:

Remaining sneakers = Initial number of sneakers - Number of sneakers sold during flash sale
= 48 - 17
= 31

The revenue from the sale to the department store is then:

Revenue from department store sale = Number of remaining sneakers × Price per sneaker
= 31 × $25
= $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale:

Total revenue = Revenue from flash sale + Revenue from department store sale
= $340 + $775
= $1115

To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost of the case of sneakers from the total revenue:

Profit = Total revenue - Initial cost
= $1115 - $576
= $539

The final answer is: $539"
"To determine the total number of crayons purchased by Beatrice, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. We have two distinct categories of crayon packets: those containing 8 pieces each and those containing 16 pieces each.

First, we calculate the total number of crayons in the packets with 8 pieces each. This can be represented as 6 * 8, where 6 denotes the number of packets and 8 represents the number of crayons in each packet. Performing this multiplication yields 48.

Next, we calculate the total number of crayons in the packets with 16 pieces each. This can be represented as 4 * 16, where 4 denotes the number of packets and 16 represents the number of crayons in each packet. Performing this multiplication yields 64.

To obtain the total number of crayons, we add the number of crayons in both categories: 48 + 64.

48 + 64 = 112

Therefore, Beatrice purchased a total of 112 crayons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{112}$"
"To determine the regular price of popcorn, let's analyze the given information. We have two scenarios:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra.
2. The regular price of a soda is $3.
3. If you buy a regular ticket and don't buy the super ticket, you save $2.

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as $p. The cost of the super ticket can be expressed as $20 = $12 (regular ticket) + $p (popcorn) + $1 (extra for popcorn and soda) + $3 (soda). Simplifying this equation, we get:

$20 = $12 + $p + $1 + $3
$20 = $16 + $p
$p = $4

However, this is not the correct answer. The correct approach is to consider the difference in cost between the two scenarios. If you buy a regular ticket for $12 and a soda for $3, the total cost is $15. If you buy the super ticket for $20 and save $2, the total cost is $18. The difference between the two scenarios is $18 - $15 = $3.

This $3 difference is the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket. Since the super ticket includes the popcorn for $1 extra, the regular price of the popcorn is $3 - $1 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to establish the original cost of filling one balloon. Given that the total cost of filling 20 helium balloons was $900, we can express this as an equation: 20x = 900, where x represents the original cost of filling one balloon.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20, yielding x = 900 / 20 = 45. This indicates that the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Subsequently, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20, resulting in a new cost of 45 + 20 = 65 per balloon.

To calculate the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price, we multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by 170: 65 * 170 = 11050.

Therefore, the total cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase is $11,050.

The final answer is: $11,050"
"To determine the average speed of the car during the trip, we can utilize the formula for average speed, which is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

Given that the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours and 30 mph for 1 hour, we can calculate the distance traveled during each segment using the formula Distance = Speed x Time.

Distance1 = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles
Distance2 = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances traveled during each segment, which is 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.

The total time taken is the sum of the times taken for each segment, which is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

Therefore, the average speed of the car during the trip is 50 mph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total value of Jenna's jewels, we must first calculate the value of the sapphires she retains and the rubies she acquires through the trade.

Initially, Jenna possesses 8 sapphires. She engages in a trade, relinquishing 3 sapphires in exchange for 2 rubies. Consequently, she retains 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires.

The value of the sapphires she retains is calculated as 5 × $800 = $4000.

The value of the rubies she acquires is determined by 2 × $1200 = $2400.

To obtain the total value of her jewels, we sum the value of the retained sapphires and the acquired rubies: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To determine the total number of apples consumed by Marin and Nancy over a 30-day period, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the combined daily consumption of apples by Marin and Nancy. Since each individual consumes 4 apples per day, their combined daily consumption is 4 + 4 = 8 apples.

Next, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days to obtain the total consumption over the specified period. This can be expressed as:

Total consumption = Daily consumption × Number of days
Total consumption = 8 apples/day × 30 days

Using the distributive property of multiplication, we can simplify this expression to:

Total consumption = 8 × 30
Total consumption = 240 apples

Therefore, Marin and Nancy consume a total of 240 apples over the 30-day period.

The final answer is: 240"
"To determine the cost of potting soil for Bob's vegetable garden, we must first calculate the total volume of soil required. Given that each raised bed is a rectangular prism with dimensions 2 feet in width, 8 feet in length, and 2 feet in height, we can calculate the volume of one bed as follows:

Volume = length × width × height = 8 ft × 2 ft × 2 ft = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

Total Volume = 32 cubic feet/bed × 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags required is:

Number of Bags = Total Volume / Volume per Bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Given that each bag costs $12, the total cost of potting soil is:

Total Cost = Number of Bags × Cost per Bag = 160 bags × $12/bag = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To determine the total number of cards, we first need to calculate the number of green cards. Given that there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can express this relationship as:

Number of green cards = 1.6 × Number of red cards

Since there are 15 red cards, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Number of green cards = 1.6 × 15
= 1.6 × 15
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

The total number of cards is the sum of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of fairies remaining, we can break down the sequence of events.

Initially, Katelyn observed 50 fairies. Subsequently, her friend witnessed half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the existing group. This implies that 25 fairies joined the initial 50, resulting in a total of 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.

However, 30 fairies departed 10 minutes later. To calculate the number of fairies remaining, we subtract the number of departing fairies from the total: 75 - 30 = 45.

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is 45.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To determine the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to calculate the total number of puppies and the number of puppies with spots.

Let's denote the total number of puppies as $T$ and the number of puppies with spots as $S$. We are given that Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

We can express the total number of puppies as the sum of the number of puppies from Jennifer's dog and the number of puppies from Brandon's dog:

$$T = 8 + 12 = 20$$

Similarly, we can express the total number of puppies with spots as the sum of the number of puppies with spots from Jennifer's dog and the number of puppies with spots from Brandon's dog:

$$S = 3 + 4 = 7$$

Now, we can calculate the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100:

$$\text{Percentage of puppies with spots} = \frac{S}{T} \times 100 = \frac{7}{20} \times 100 = 35\%$$

Therefore, the percentage of puppies with spots is 35%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make to transport the feed, we must first calculate the total weight of the feed. This can be achieved by summing the weights of each type of feed.

The weight of the sugar cubes is 2 pounds, as the farmer purchases two 1-pound boxes. The weight of the carrots is 48 pounds, as four 12-pound bags are purchased. The weight of the hay is 3150 pounds, as 42 bales of 75 pounds each are bought. Lastly, the weight of the oats is 1300 pounds, as 20 sacks of 65 pounds each are purchased.

The total weight of the feed is therefore:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Total weight} &= 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 \\
&= 3400 \text{ pounds}
\end{aligned}
$$

Given that the farm truck has a capacity of 2250 pounds, we can calculate the number of trips required to transport the feed by dividing the total weight by the truck's capacity:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Number of trips} &= \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Truck capacity}} \\
&= \frac{3400}{2250} \\
&= 1.511\bar{1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the number of trips must be a whole number, we must round up to the nearest integer. Therefore, the farmer needs to make $\boxed{2}$ trips to transport all the feed."
"To determine Grayson's monthly earnings from recycling, we need to calculate the total value of the aluminum cans and plastic bottles she recycles in a month.

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings from each type of recyclable:

Aluminum cans: 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week
Plastic bottles: 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

The total weekly earnings can be found by summing the earnings from both types of recyclables:
Total weekly earnings = 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the total monthly earnings by multiplying the weekly earnings by 4:
Total monthly earnings = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month

Therefore, Grayson earns 84 cents per month from recycling.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the number of plants Shondra has, we can establish a sequence of relationships between the individuals' plant collections. 

Let's denote the number of plants Frederick has as F, the number of plants Toni has as T, and the number of plants Shondra has as S. We are given that F = 10 and T = F + 0.6F, since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick.

First, we calculate the number of plants Toni has:
T = F + 0.6F
T = 1.6F
T = 1.6(10)
T = 16

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Therefore, we can express the number of plants Shondra has as:
S = T - 7
S = 16 - 7
S = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the current amount Ali possesses, we must first calculate the amount Leila contributed to his initial funds. Given that Leila donated half of her $100, we can express this as a mathematical operation:

Leila's contribution = (1/2) × $100
= $50

Now, we can add this contribution to Ali's initial amount to find the total:

Total amount = Initial amount + Leila's contribution
= $21 + $50
= $71

Therefore, the current amount Ali possesses is $71.

The final answer is: $71"
"To determine the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to calculate the tip as a fraction of the cost of the pizza. Given that the tip is equal to 1/5 of the cost of the pizza, we can express this as a mathematical equation:

Tip = (1/5) × Cost of the pizza

Substituting the given cost of the pizza, which is $15, we can calculate the tip as follows:

Tip = (1/5) × $15
Tip = $3

Now, to find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza:

Total amount = Cost of the pizza + Tip
Total amount = $15 + $3
Total amount = $18

Therefore, the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"To determine Finley's final position in the 100-meter race, we can analyze her movements step by step. 

Initially, Finley starts in the first position. 

She then falls back 5 spots, which places her in the 6th position. This can be represented as:

Initial Position = 1
Fall back 5 spots = 1 - 5 = 6

Next, she moves ahead 2 spots, so her new position is:

New Position = 6 + 2 = 8

However, she then falls behind 3 spots, which changes her position to:

New Position = 8 - 3 = 5

Finally, she jumps ahead 1 spot to finish the race, resulting in a final position of:

Final Position = 5 + 1 = 6

Therefore, Finley finishes the race in the 6th position.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the number of students Miss Maria has, we must first calculate the total number of cards she possesses. Given that she has six decks of basketball cards, each containing 25 cards, the total number of basketball cards is 6 × 25 = 150.

Similarly, with five boxes of baseball cards, each containing 40 cards, the total number of baseball cards is 5 × 40 = 200.

The total number of cards is the sum of basketball and baseball cards, which is 150 + 200 = 350.

Since Miss Maria retains 50 cards, the number of cards she distributes to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

To find the number of students, we divide the total number of cards distributed by the number of cards each student receives, which is 300 ÷ 10 = 30.

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the difference in the amount paid by Kelly and Becky, we first need to calculate the total cost of the apples for each individual.

Becky purchased 20 apples at a cost of $0.45 per apple. The total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Number of apples × Cost per apple
Total cost = 20 × $0.45
Total cost = $9.00

Becky received a $1 discount, which can be subtracted from the total cost:

Total amount paid by Becky = Total cost - Discount
Total amount paid by Becky = $9.00 - $1.00
Total amount paid by Becky = $8.00

Kelly purchased 20 apples at a cost of $0.50 per apple. The total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Number of apples × Cost per apple
Total cost = 20 × $0.50
Total cost = $10.00

Kelly received a 10% discount on the total cost. To calculate the discount amount, we can multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (expressed as a decimal):

Discount = Total cost × Discount percentage
Discount = $10.00 × 0.10
Discount = $1.00

The total amount paid by Kelly can be calculated by subtracting the discount from the total cost:

Total amount paid by Kelly = Total cost - Discount
Total amount paid by Kelly = $10.00 - $1.00
Total amount paid by Kelly = $9.00

To find the difference in the amount paid by Kelly and Becky, we can subtract the total amount paid by Becky from the total amount paid by Kelly:

Difference = Total amount paid by Kelly - Total amount paid by Becky
Difference = $9.00 - $8.00
Difference = $1.00

The final answer is: $1."
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply it by the total number of rooms.

Let's denote the number of sheets as S, the number of comforters as C, the number of pillow cases as P, and the number of towels as T. We are given that:

- S = 2 (since each room has two sheets)
- C = 1 (since each room has one comforter)
- P = 2S (twice as many pillow cases as sheets)
- T = 2P (twice as many towels as pillow cases)

Substituting the value of S into the equation for P, we get P = 2(2) = 4. Then, substituting the value of P into the equation for T, we get T = 2(4) = 8.

Now, we can calculate the total number of items per room by adding the number of sheets, comforters, pillow cases, and towels: S + C + P + T = 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15.

To find the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we multiply the total number of items per room by the total number of rooms: 15 * 80 = 1200.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1200}$"
"To determine the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has on Sunday, we need to calculate the cumulative number of shoes he acquires and then subtract the shoes he discards on Saturday.

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes.

On Monday, he acquires 5 pairs of shoes, which is equivalent to 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes, which amounts to 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.

On Friday, he acquires 30 new pairs of shoes, resulting in an additional 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Thus, the total number of shoes he has after acquiring new pairs is 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he discards 180 shoes.

Therefore, the total number of shoes he has on Sunday is 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

The final numerical answer is: 120"
"To determine the number of pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles she has. Given that each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, we can calculate the total number of cupcakes as follows:

Total cupcakes = Number of jars × Cupcakes per jar
Total cupcakes = 6 × 8
Total cupcakes = 48

Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we can determine the number of pans needed by dividing the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per pan:

Number of pans = Total cupcakes ÷ Cupcakes per pan
Number of pans = 48 ÷ 12
Number of pans = 4

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles."
"To determine the amount of change Theo received, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased and subtract that from the amount she paid.

The cost of the pen is $2. The cost of the paper is $1 less than three times the price of the pen, which can be expressed as 3p - 1, where p is the price of the pen. Substituting the value of p, we get 3(2) - 1 = 6 - 1 = $5.

The total cost of the items is the sum of the cost of the pen and the paper, which is $2 + $5 = $7.

Since Theo gave the cashier $10, the change she received is $10 - $7 = $3.

Therefore, the amount of change Theo received is $3."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. 

First, we need to determine the total number of pencils initially in the class. Since there are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils, we can calculate the total number of pencils as follows:

Total pencils initially = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

Next, we need to find the number of pencils used after two months. It is given that 1/5 of the total pencils were used. We can express this as a fraction of the total pencils:

Pencils used = (1/5) * 300 = 60 pencils

Now, we can find the remaining pencils after two months by subtracting the pencils used from the total:

Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. We can calculate this as follows:

Pencils left = (1/3) * 240 = 80 pencils

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

$$\frac{1}{2}x + 2 = 5$$

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

$$\frac{1}{2}x = 5 - 2$$

$$\frac{1}{2}x = 3$$

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

$$x = 3 \cdot 2$$

$$x = 6$$

Therefore, Matt must eat 6 carrot sticks to have the opportunity to eat 5 cookies."
"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras, we first need to calculate the combined length of the remoras. Given that each remora is 6 inches in length, we can convert this to feet, as the shark's length is provided in feet.

Since 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches, we can express the length of each remora in feet as follows:

6 inches = 6/12 = 0.5 feet

With two remoras attached to the shark, the combined length of the remoras is:

2 * 0.5 = 1 foot

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras:

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

Therefore, the remoras occupy 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Given that three-fourths of the students at a particular grade level possess a desktop computer, we can infer that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. The proportion of students without a desktop computer can be represented as (1/4)x.

We are provided with the information that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, which is equivalent to (1/4)x. To determine the total number of students, we can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate x:

$$\frac{1}{4}x = 20$$

Multiplying both sides by 4:

$$x = 20 \times 4$$

$$x = 80$$

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the number of days Jason has to walk to break in his new shoes, we need to calculate the total number of days he has available in three weeks and then divide that by the number of days he can walk per week.

First, let's calculate the total number of days in three weeks:

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, we need to find out how many days he has to walk in total in 3 weeks.

To do this, we can divide the total number of days in three weeks by the number of days he can walk per week:

21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4

"To determine the number of books each child received, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. Given that Sarah spent $300 on books, with each book costing $15, we can calculate the total number of books purchased as follows:

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah distributed the books equally among her 4 children, we can find the number of books each child received by dividing the total number of books by 4:

Number of books each child got = Total number of books / 4
Number of books each child got = 20 / 4
Number of books each child got = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of kids in Gina's class who are not allergic to anything, we can utilize the principle of inclusion-exclusion from set theory. This principle allows us to calculate the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts by adding the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number allergic to peanuts, then subtracting the number allergic to both to avoid double-counting.

Let's denote the total number of kids in the class as $N$, the number of kids allergic to dairy as $D$, the number of kids allergic to peanuts as $P$, and the number of kids allergic to both as $B$. We are given that $N = 32$, $D = 9$, $P = 6$, and $B = 3$.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts is given by:

$D + P - B$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$9 + 6 - 3 = 12$

Now, to find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class:

$N - (D + P - B) = 32 - 12 = 20$

Therefore, the number of kids in Gina's class who are not allergic to anything is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of individuals participating in the tour, we must first calculate the total number of employees and then add the number of tour guides.

Given that the employees are divided into 3 groups of 200, we can calculate the total number of employees as follows:

Total number of employees = Number of groups × Number of employees per group
= 3 × 200
= 600

Next, we need to calculate the total number of tour guides. Since each group has 7 tour guides and there are 3 groups, the total number of tour guides is:

Total number of tour guides = Number of groups × Number of tour guides per group
= 3 × 7
= 21

Now, to find the total number of people going on the tour, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides:

Total number of people = Total number of employees + Total number of tour guides
= 600 + 21
= 621

Therefore, the total number of people going on the tour is 621.

The final answer is: 621"
"To determine the total cost of the trip, we must first calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel separately.

The cost of the plane tickets is a straightforward calculation, as each ticket costs $5000. Since there are two individuals, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 \* $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel, however, is a more complex scenario. The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day, but it is 20% more expensive due to the busy weekend. To calculate the new price, we can use the following formula:

New price = Normal price + (Normal price \* 0.20)

Substituting the given values, we get:

New price = $1500 + ($1500 \* 0.20)
New price = $1500 + $300
New price = $1800

Since the couple will be staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is:

Total hotel cost = New price \* Number of days
Total hotel cost = $1800 \* 3
Total hotel cost = $5400

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the trip by adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel:

Total cost = Cost of plane tickets + Total hotel cost
Total cost = $10,000 + $5400
Total cost = $16,400

The final answer is: $16,400"
"To determine the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he possesses.

Let's denote the number of tubes of blue paint Ben has as B. Given that Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, we can express this as J = B/2, where J represents the number of tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Since Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, we can substitute B = 4 into the equation, yielding J = 4/2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Next, we consider the number of tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, which can be expressed as J = 3B. Given that Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, we can substitute B = 3 into the equation, resulting in J = 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint: 2 + 9 = 11.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"Given the problem, we can approach it by first determining the weight of the 2010 penny relative to the 1959 penny. We are told that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny

We are also given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, to find the combined weight of the two pennies, we simply add the weights of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 + 36
Combined weight = 84 grains

Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the remaining amount required to reach their goal, we can calculate the difference between the target amount and the total earnings of Keegan and Tasha.

Let's denote the target amount as T = $200, Keegan's earnings as K = $83, and Tasha's earnings as S = $91. The total earnings can be calculated as the sum of Keegan's and Tasha's earnings: K + S = $83 + $91 = $174.

Now, we can find the remaining amount required by subtracting the total earnings from the target amount: T - (K + S) = $200 - $174 = $26.

Therefore, Keegan and Tasha need to earn an additional $26 to reach their goal.

The final answer is: $26"
"To determine the difference in the number of songs Luri and Gabriel can add to their respective portable media players, we first need to establish the number of songs each can currently store. Given that each player has a capacity of 100 songs, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we can calculate the number of songs Luri has by multiplying Gabriel's song count by 3, as Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. This yields 3 * 20 = 60 songs for Luri.

Now, we can calculate the number of additional songs each can store by subtracting the number of songs they already have from the total capacity of 100. For Gabriel, this is 100 - 20 = 80 additional songs. For Luri, it is 100 - 60 = 40 additional songs.

The difference in the number of additional songs Luri and Gabriel can store is 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we first need to calculate the number of oranges he consumed. Given that they picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them, we can express this as a fraction of the total number of oranges.

Let's denote the total number of oranges as $T = 60$. The fraction of oranges Stetson ate is $\frac{2}{5}$. Therefore, the number of oranges he consumed can be calculated as:

$$\frac{2}{5} \cdot T = \frac{2}{5} \cdot 60 = \frac{2 \cdot 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24$$

Now that we know Stetson ate 24 oranges, we can calculate the total amount of money he gave up. Since he gave up $10 for each orange, we can express this as a simple multiplication:

$$\text{Total Amount} = 24 \cdot 10 = 240$$

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"Given that Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes, we can express this relationship as an algebraic equation. Let's denote the cost of her shoes as S and the cost of her handbag as B.

We are given that S = $80. To find the cost of the handbag, we can express the relationship between the two as:

B = 3S - 20

Substituting the given value of S into the equation, we get:

B = 3(80) - 20
B = 240 - 20
B = 220

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total hours James runs in a week, we first need to calculate the total distance he covers in a week. Given that he runs 12 miles per day for 5 days a week, we can calculate this as follows:

Total miles run in a week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
= 60 miles/week

Next, we can use James' running speed to find the total hours he runs in a week. His speed is given as 10 miles per hour. We can calculate the total hours as follows:

Hours run in a week = Total miles run in a week / Speed
= 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
= 6 hours/week

Therefore, James runs 6 hours a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of bags of oats required to feed Uncle Ben's horses for five days, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by the horses in a day and then multiply it by the number of days.

First, we calculate the daily oats consumption per horse. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and Uncle Ben feeds his horses twice a day. Therefore, the daily oats consumption per horse is 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total daily oats consumption for all horses is 10 pounds/day * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

To find the total oats consumption for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days: 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Given that one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we can calculate the number of bags required as follows:

Number of bags = Total oats consumption / Oats per bag
= 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag
= 4 bags

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of girl Pomeranians, we can employ a straightforward approach by first identifying the proportion of Pomeranians among Jana's puppies and then calculating the corresponding proportion of girl Pomeranians.

Given that Jana has 27 puppies, we can express the number of Pomeranians as a fraction of the total:

Pomeranians = (2/3) × 27

To calculate this, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 1, effectively multiplying 27 by 2 and dividing by 3:

Pomeranians = (2 × 27) / 3
Pomeranians = 54 / 3
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians, which is one third of the total Pomeranians:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) × 18
Girl Pomeranians = 18 / 3
Girl Pomeranians = 6

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

The final answer is: 6"

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48°F, in Northlandia is 21°F, and in Midlandia is -3°F.

We can calculate the sum of these temperatures as follows:

-48 + 21 - 3 = -30

Now, we divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3:

-30 / 3 = -10

Therefore, the average highest temperature of the three countries is -10°F."
"To determine the number of days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we can employ a straightforward financial planning approach. 

First, we need to calculate the remaining amount the child needs to save, which is the difference between the total cost of the toy car and the amount already saved.

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Next, we can use the concept of time value of money to calculate the number of days it will take to save the remaining amount. Since the child promises to save a fixed amount daily, we can use the formula:

Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Number of days = $8 / $2
Number of days = 4

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of eggs that Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we can employ a simple mathematical approach. Given that each tray can accommodate 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, we can calculate the total capacity of the trays as follows:

Total capacity = Number of trays × Capacity per tray
Total capacity = 2 trays × 24 eggs/tray
Total capacity = 48 eggs

Now, we can subtract the total capacity from the total number of eggs Jaime has to find the number of eggs that won't fit:

Number of eggs that won't fit = Total number of eggs - Total capacity
Number of eggs that won't fit = 64 eggs - 48 eggs
Number of eggs that won't fit = 16 eggs

Therefore, the number of eggs that Jaime won't be able to place on the tray is 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total amount Sally spent on pizzas, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. The cost of the small pizza is $8, and the family-size pizza costs three times as much. This can be represented as:

Cost of small pizza = $8
Cost of family-size pizza = 3 × Cost of small pizza = 3 × $8 = $24

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent by adding the cost of both pizzas:

Total amount spent = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza
= $8 + $24
= $32

Therefore, the total amount Sally spent on pizzas is $32."
"To determine the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we must first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Given that the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors, which costs $4.00. However, she also has a $2.00 coupon, resulting in a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors: $\frac{\$2.00}{8} = \$0.25$.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $\$0.25 \times 100 = 25$ cents.

The final numerical answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total height of the human pyramid, we must consider the heights of each level and sum them up. 

Let's denote the height of each level as follows:

- The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

- The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

- The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

- The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 

536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

Therefore, the total height of the human pyramid is 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44.67}$"
"To determine the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of minutes she walked in a day and then multiplying it by the number of days she worked.

Given that Charisma walks 5 minutes every hour and works 8 hours a day, we can calculate the daily walking time as follows:

Daily walking time = 5 minutes/hour * 8 hours = 40 minutes/day

Since Charisma worked for 5 days, the total number of minutes she walked is:

Total walking time = Daily walking time * Number of days
= 40 minutes/day * 5 days
= 200 minutes

Therefore, the total number of minutes Charisma walked after 5 days at the office is 200 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize algebraic reasoning. Let's denote Angela's current age as A and Brett's current age as B. We are given that Brett is 14 years old, so B = 14. In four years, Brett's age will be B + 4, and Angela's age will be A + 4.

We are also given that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. This can be expressed as:

A + 4 = 3B

Substituting B = 14 into the equation, we get:

A + 4 = 3(14)

Expanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get:

A + 4 = 42

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation, we get:

A = 38

Therefore, Angela's current age is 38 years old.

"To determine the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then summing these values.

The cost of the morning rides can be calculated as the product of the number of days (14) and the cost per ride ($6), which yields:

14 \* $6 = $84

Similarly, the cost of the afternoon rides is the product of the number of days (14) and the cost per ride ($2), resulting in:

14 \* $2 = $28

To obtain the total cost, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides:

$84 + $28 = $112

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is $112.

The final answer is: $112"
"To determine the number of Greek orange pies that can be made, we need to calculate the total number of oranges available and then divide that by the number of oranges required for one pie.

Let's denote the number of oranges Ashley brought as A and the number of oranges Brianne brought as B. We are given that A = 5 * 10 = 50, since Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box. Additionally, we know that B = A + 20, as Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley.

Therefore, B = 50 + 20 = 70.

The total number of oranges available is the sum of the oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne, which is A + B = 50 + 70 = 120.

Since one Greek orange pie requires 3 oranges, the number of pies that can be made is given by the total number of oranges divided by the number of oranges per pie, i.e., (A + B) / 3.

Thus, the number of pies that can be made is 120 / 3 = 40.

"To determine the number of guests required for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

The cost of the first venue is a flat fee of $200 plus an additional $5 per guest for food, which can be expressed as:

C1 = 200 + 5x

The cost of the second venue is a per-person charge of $25, which includes food, so the total cost can be expressed as:

C2 = 25x

To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides yields:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 gives us:

x = 10

Therefore, the number of guests required for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects. So, the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. 

We can write the equation as: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: B + B = 2B, and 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the equation becomes: 2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

"To determine the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we can calculate the yards used by each individual and then sum them.

First, let's calculate the yards used by Mariah. Since she used 1/4 of a skein, we can express this as a fraction of the total yards in a skein:

$$\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91$$

Next, we'll calculate the yards used by her grandma, who used 1/2 of a skein:

$$\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182$$

Now, we can sum the yards used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total yards of yarn used:

"Given the problem, we can establish a series of relationships between the dimensions of the chair, rug, and couch. 

Let's denote the width of the chair as $c$, the width of the rug as $r$, and the length of the couch as $l$. We are given that the chair is 3 feet wide, so $c = 3$ feet.

The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so we can express its width as $r = c + 5$. Substituting the value of $c$, we get $r = 3 + 5 = 8$ feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. This relationship can be expressed as $l = 2r + 2$. Substituting the value of $r$, we get $l = 2(8) + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18$ feet.

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we can utilize a linear equation to model the given scenario. Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. Since Suzie purchased two packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x.

The cost of the grape gum is $2, and the cost of the green apple gum is half of that, which is $1. Therefore, the total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

Given that the total cost of all the gum is $7, we can set up the equation: 2x + 3 = 7.

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, 2x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2, x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2.

"To determine the optimal lumber purchase for Frederick's popsicle stick production, we must first calculate the cost-effectiveness of each type of wood. The cost-effectiveness can be measured by the number of popsicle sticks obtained per dollar spent.

For a 2 x 4 piece of wood, the number of sticks obtained per dollar is given by the ratio of the number of sticks to the cost:

$$\frac{200}{4} = 50$$

For a 2 x 8 piece of wood, the number of sticks obtained per dollar is given by the ratio of the number of sticks to the cost:

$$\frac{400}{6} \approx 66.67$$

Since 66.67 is greater than 50, the 2 x 8 piece of wood is the more cost-effective option.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24 budget:

$$\frac{24}{6} = 4$$

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood yields 400 sticks, 4 pieces of wood will yield a total of:

$$4 \times 400 = 1600$$

Therefore, the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1600}$"
"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's sled dogs, we must first calculate the total number of snowshoes required. Given that each dog has four legs and Mario has six dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12.

However, it's essential to note that this calculation assumes each dog requires a pair of snowshoes, which is a reasonable assumption given the context. If we were to consider the possibility of snowshoes being sold in pairs, we would need to adjust our calculation accordingly.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00, so the total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To determine the weekly expenditure on bus trips, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the cost of a single bus trip by the number of trips taken in a week.

Let's denote the cost of a single bus trip as $2.20 and the number of trips taken in a week as 5.

Weekly bus trip cost = Cost of a single bus trip × Number of trips in a week
= $2.20 × 5
= $11.00

Now, we can compare this to the cost of a weekly bus pass, which is $20. To find the amount saved by purchasing the weekly bus pass, we subtract the weekly bus trip cost from the cost of the weekly bus pass.

Amount saved = Cost of weekly bus pass - Weekly bus trip cost
= $20 - $11.00
= $9.00

Therefore, Janet would save $9.00 by buying a weekly bus pass for $20 instead of paying for individual bus trips.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Given the information provided, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of cows and sheep at the farm and the zoo.

Let F represent the number of cows at the farm, S represent the number of sheep at the farm, Z_c represent the number of cows at the zoo, and Z_s represent the number of sheep at the zoo.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. F = 30 (the farm has 30 cows)
2. Z_c = 2F (the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm)
3. Z_s = 2S (the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo)
4. Z_s = 20 (the zoo has 20 sheep)

Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get Z_c = 2(30) = 60.

Substituting equation (1) into equation (3), we get S = (1/2)F = (1/2)(30) = 15.

Now, we can substitute the value of S into equation (4) to verify the number of sheep at the zoo: Z_s = 2S = 2(15) = 30. However, we are given that Z_s = 20, which indicates an inconsistency in the problem statement.

Assuming the problem statement is correct, we can proceed with the given information. The total number of animals at the farm is F + S = 30 + 15 = 45. The total number of animals at the zoo is Z_c + Z_s = 60 + 20 = 80.

The total number of animals at both the farm and the zoo is 45 + 80 = 125.

The final answer is: 125"
"Let's analyze the problem. We are given that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. If Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'.

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can write the equation as:
x + y = 4(x + y)

However, this equation is not necessary to solve the problem. We can directly use the information that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, so we can write the equation as:
12 = 4x
4 = 4y

Simplifying the equations:
x = 3
y = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the required daily calorie deficit for Andy to achieve his weight loss goal, we must first calculate the total number of days he has available to lose the weight. Given that his birthday is on July 19th and today is December 31st, we can calculate the number of days as follows:

December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming a non-leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. Therefore, the total number of days is:

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Total days} &= 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 \\
&= 171 \text{ days}
\end{aligned}$$

Since Andy aims to lose 30 pounds, and it is well-established that a calorie deficit of 3500 calories is required to lose 1 pound, the total calorie deficit needed is:

$$\text{Total calorie deficit} = 30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105,000 \text{ calories}$$

To find the required daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:

$$\text{Daily calorie deficit} = \frac{105,000 \text{ calories}}{171 \text{ days}} \approx 613.5 \text{ calories/day}$$

Therefore, Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of approximately 613.5 calories to reach his weight loss goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{614}$"
"To determine Gerald's remaining funds after a week of work, we must first calculate his total earnings and then subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald's daily earnings are $30. Since he worked for an entire week, which consists of 7 days, his total earnings can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Daily Earnings} \times \text{Number of Days} \\
= \$30 \times 7 \\
= \$210
$$

Now, to find out how much Gerald has left after spending $100, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

$$
\text{Remaining Funds} = \text{Total Earnings} - \text{Amount Spent} \\
= \$210 - \$100 \\
= \$110
$$

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left."
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total distance she will run. Given that each lap is 0.25 km and she is required to run 8 laps, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

Total distance = Number of laps × Distance per lap
Total distance = 8 laps × 0.25 km/lap
Total distance = 2 km

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, considering that she requires 60 ml of water per kilometer:

Total water consumption = Total distance × Water consumption per kilometer
Total water consumption = 2 km × 60 ml/km
Total water consumption = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 120 ml of water after completing her run.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the amount of money Julie had left after her purchases, we can apply the concept of percentage reduction to the initial amount.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Julie had as $500. The first reduction is 20% of $500, which can be calculated as follows:

20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

This means Julie spent $100 on clothes, leaving her with:

$500 - $100 = $400

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. This can be calculated as:

25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Therefore, the amount spent on CDs is $100, leaving Julie with:

$400 - $100 = $300

Hence, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combining like terms, we get 4x = 120,000.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000.

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can calculate the cost of the house as 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To determine the profit earned by Tara on her canvas bags, we can employ a basic financial analysis framework. The profit is calculated as the difference between the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Tara purchased 8 packs of 5 canvas bags at $4 each. The total number of bags is 8 packs * 5 bags/pack = 40 bags. The total cost is then 40 bags * $4/bag = $160.

Next, we calculate the total revenue. Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue is 40 bags * $8/bag = $320.

Now, we can determine the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $320 - $160 = $160.

Therefore, the profit earned by Tara on her canvas bags is $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To determine the total number of punches thrown by Joe during the fight, we must first calculate the total duration of the fight in minutes. Given that the fight consists of 5 rounds, each lasting 3 minutes, the total duration can be computed as follows:

Total duration = Number of rounds × Duration per round
Total duration = 5 rounds × 3 minutes/round
Total duration = 15 minutes

Next, we can calculate the total number of punches thrown by multiplying the total duration by the average number of punches thrown per minute:

Total punches = Total duration × Average punches per minute
Total punches = 15 minutes × 25 punches/minute
Total punches = 375 punches

Therefore, the total number of punches thrown by Joe during the fight is 375.

The final answer is: $\boxed{375}$"
"To determine the number of cookies Kelsie made, we can establish a relationship between the number of cookies each individual made. Let's denote the number of cookies Josh made as $J$, the number of cookies Suzanne made as $S$, and the number of cookies Kelsie made as $K$.

Given that Suzanne made 36 cookies, we have $S = 36$. We are also told that Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, so $J = \frac{1}{4}S = \frac{1}{4}(36) = 9$.

Furthermore, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, which can be expressed as $K = 2J$. Substituting the value of $J$, we get $K = 2(9) = 18$.

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Ali has. This can be done by summing the values of the $10 bills and the $20 bills.

Let's denote the number of $10 bills as $n_{10}$ and the number of $20 bills as $n_{20}$. We are given that $n_{10} = 4$ and $n_{20} = 6$. Therefore, the total amount of money can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Total Money} = n_{10} \times 10 + n_{20} \times 20 = 4 \times 10 + 6 \times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160
$$

Next, we need to find the amount of money Ali gives to his sister, which is half of the total money. This can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Money Given to Sister} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Total Money} = \frac{1}{2} \times 160 = 80
$$

Now, we need to find the amount of money left after giving his sister half of the total money:

$$
\text{Money Left} = \text{Total Money} - \text{Money Given to Sister} = 160 - 80 = 80
$$

Finally, we need to find the amount of money Ali uses to buy dinner, which is 3/5 of the remaining money:

$$
\text{Money Used for Dinner} = \frac{3}{5} \times \text{Money Left} = \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48
$$

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:

$$
\text{Money Left After Dinner} = \text{Money Left} - \text{Money Used for Dinner} = 80 - 48 = 32
$$

The final answer is: $32"
"To determine the time it takes Royce to shingle a house, we first need to convert Rob's time from hours to minutes. Given that Rob takes 2 hours, we can calculate this as 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Now, we can express the relationship between Royce's and Rob's times as a linear equation. Let R be the time it takes Royce to shingle a house in minutes. We know that Royce takes double the time it takes Rob plus 40 minutes, which can be represented as R = 2(120) + 40.

Simplifying the equation, we get R = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

Therefore, the time it takes Royce to shingle a house is 280 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool required, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total skeins needed for each item and then summing these values.

Let's denote the number of children as $n$, the number of skeins required for a hat as $h$, a scarf as $s$, a sweater as $w$, a pair of mittens as $m$, and a pair of socks as $k$. Given that Martha has triplets, $n = 3$. The respective values for the number of skeins required for each item are $h = 2$, $s = 4$, $w = 12$, $m = 1$, and $k = 2$.

The total number of skeins required for each item can be calculated as follows:

- Hats: $n \cdot h = 3 \cdot 2 = 6$
- Scarves: $n \cdot s = 3 \cdot 4 = 12$
- Sweaters: $n \cdot w = 3 \cdot 12 = 36$
- Mittens: $n \cdot m = 3 \cdot 1 = 3$
- Socks: $n \cdot k = 3 \cdot 2 = 6$

Now, we can sum the total number of skeins required for each item to obtain the overall amount needed:
$6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63$

Therefore, Martha will need to purchase a total of 63 skeins of wool.

The final answer is: $\boxed{63}$"
"To determine the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

Let's denote the total number of math problems as $T = 100$. On Monday, Chris completes 12 problems, leaving him with $T - 12$ problems to complete.

On Tuesday, Chris completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is $3 \times 12 = 36$ problems. Therefore, the total number of problems completed by Tuesday is $12 + 36 = 48$.

The number of problems remaining after Tuesday is $T - 48 = 100 - 48 = 52$.

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is $\frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13$ problems. Therefore, the total number of problems completed by Wednesday is $48 + 13 = 61$.

The number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is $T - 61 = 100 - 61 = 39$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{39}$"
"To determine the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm, we need to calculate the individual rates at which each of them can pick strawberries and then sum these rates.

Let's denote the number of quarts Tony can pick per hour as $T$, the number of quarts Bobby can pick per hour as $B$, the number of quarts Kathy can pick per hour as $K$, and the number of quarts Ricky can pick per hour as $R$.

We are given that $T = 6$ quarts per hour. Since Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, we have $B = T - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5$ quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so $K = 2B = 2(5) = 10$ quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so $R = K - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8$ quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour by summing their individual rates:

$T + B + K + R = 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29$ quarts per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread left, we can apply basic principles of inventory management and arithmetic operations. 

Let's denote the initial number of loaves as I, the number of loaves sold as S, and the number of loaves returned as R. We are given that I = 200, S = 93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132, and R = 6.

The number of loaves left can be calculated as follows:

Loaves left = I - S - R
= 200 - 132 - 6
= 62

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread left is 62."
"To determine the number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant, we need to calculate the maximum number of rows for each type of tulip and then sum the results.

For the red tulips, we have 36 flowers and can fit 6 flowers in a row. The number of rows of red tulips can be calculated as follows:

Number of rows of red tulips = Total number of red tulips / Number of tulips per row
= 36 / 6
= 6

For the blue tulips, we have 24 flowers and can fit 8 flowers in a row. The number of rows of blue tulips can be calculated as follows:

Number of rows of blue tulips = Total number of blue tulips / Number of tulips per row
= 24 / 8
= 3

Since we can plant both types of tulips in separate rows, the total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is the sum of the rows of red and blue tulips.

Total number of rows = Number of rows of red tulips + Number of rows of blue tulips
= 6 + 3
= 9

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to consider the total amount of raisins available and the amount required for each batch of cookies.

Given that the jumbo bag of raisins contains 27 cups, and Heather intends to divide the raisins equally among oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of these items will receive 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Consequently, the remaining raisins for oatmeal cookies will be 27 - 9 = 18 cups.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 cup of raisins, we can calculate the number of batches by dividing the available raisins by the amount required per batch:

$$\frac{18}{\frac{3}{4}} = 18 \times \frac{4}{3} = 24$$

Therefore, Heather can make 24 batches of oatmeal cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we must first calculate her daily and weekly energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh), then multiply it by the cost per kilowatt hour.

Let's denote the daily energy consumption before adding the device as $E_{\text{before}}$ and the daily energy consumption after adding the device as $E_{\text{after}}$. Given that Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kWh and the new device consumes 2 kWh per day, we have:

$$E_{\text{before}} = 12 \text{ kWh/day}$$

$$E_{\text{after}} = 12 + 2 = 14 \text{ kWh/day}$$

To find the weekly energy consumption, we multiply the daily energy consumption by 7:

$$E_{\text{before, weekly}} = 7 \cdot E_{\text{before}} = 7 \cdot 12 = 84 \text{ kWh/week}$$

$$E_{\text{after, weekly}} = 7 \cdot E_{\text{after}} = 7 \cdot 14 = 98 \text{ kWh/week}$$

Given that the cost per kilowatt hour is $1.50, we can calculate the weekly energy cost before and after adding the device:

$$C_{\text{before}} = E_{\text{before, weekly}} \cdot 1.50 = 84 \cdot 1.50 = \$126$$

$$C_{\text{after}} = E_{\text{after, weekly}} \cdot 1.50 = 98 \cdot 1.50 = \$147$$

The difference in weekly electric bill is then:

$$\Delta C = C_{\text{after}} - C_{\text{before}} = 147 - 126 = \$21$$

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we can utilize the concept of work rate and the principle of inverse proportionality between the number of workers and the time required to complete a task.

Let's denote the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house as $T_1$ and the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house as $T_5$. We are given that one person can paint half a house in 5 days, which implies that $T_1 = 5 \times 2 = 10$ days to paint a whole house.

The work rate of one person is inversely proportional to the time it takes to complete the task. Therefore, the work rate of 5 people is 5 times the work rate of one person. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$\frac{1}{T_5} = 5 \times \frac{1}{T_1}$$

Substituting the value of $T_1$, we get:

$$\frac{1}{T_5} = 5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{2}$$

Solving for $T_5$, we find:

$$T_5 = 2$$

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house in hours is:

$$T_5 \times 24 = 2 \times 24 = 48$$

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of sofas and chairs Ophelia and Jenna possess.

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as C and the number of sofas as S. According to the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. S = 20 (Ophelia has 20 sofas)
2. C = S + 2 (Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs)
3. C = 3S (Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia)

"To determine the number of additional CDs Tom could have purchased if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to calculate the number of CDs he could have bought with the money spent on the headphone set and then subtract the number of CDs he actually bought.

Let's denote the cost of one CD as $4 and the cost of the headphone set as $44. The total amount Tom spent is $48.

The number of CDs Tom could have bought with the money spent on the headphone set is calculated as follows:

$$\text{Number of CDs that could have been bought with headphone set money} = \frac{\text{Cost of headphone set}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} = \frac{\$44}{\$4} = 11$$

The number of CDs Tom could have bought with the total amount he spent is:

$$\text{Number of CDs that could have been bought with total money} = \frac{\text{Total money spent}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} = \frac{\$48}{\$4} = 12$$

Therefore, the number of additional CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set is:

$$\text{Number of additional CDs} = \text{Number of CDs that could have been bought with total money} - \text{Number of CDs that could have been bought with headphone set money} = 12 - 11 = 1$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to consider the varying durations of his workout sessions. 

Let's denote the number of weeks where Josh spent 4 hours as $w_4$, the number of weeks where he spent 5 hours as $w_5$, and the number of weeks where he spent 6 hours as $w_6$. We are given that $w_4 + w_5 + w_6 = 8$.

We know that Josh spent 4 hours for 6 weeks, so the total hours spent during these weeks is $4w_4 = 4 \cdot 6 = 24$ hours. For the weeks where he spent 5 hours, the total hours spent is $5w_5 = 5 \cdot 2 = 10$ hours. Lastly, for the week where he spent 6 hours, the total hours spent is $6w_6 = 6 \cdot 1 = 6$ hours.

The total number of hours spent working out is the sum of the hours spent in each type of week: $4w_4 + 5w_5 + 6w_6$. Substituting the known values, we get $24 + 10 + 6 = 40$ hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, resulting in a reduction of 8 passengers. The number of passengers remaining is given by:

48 - 8 = 40

Subsequently, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. Therefore, the total number of passengers after the first stop is:

40 (remaining) + 40 (new passengers) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leading to a reduction of 21 passengers. The number of passengers remaining is:

80 - 21 = 59

Next, 3 times fewer passengers get on, which is equivalent to 3 times the number of passengers who got off (21) minus the number of passengers who got on. However, this can be interpreted as 21 - 3 * 21 = 21 - 63 = -42. Since the number of passengers cannot be negative, this implies that 63 more passengers got on.

Therefore, the total number of passengers after the second stop is:

59 (remaining) + 63 (new passengers) = 122

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote Jame's current age as $J$ and his cousin's current age as $C$.

From the problem statement, we know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is $J = 27 - 5 = 22$ years.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. We can represent this as an equation:

$$C + 8 = 2(J + 8) - 5$$

Substituting $J = 22$ into the equation, we get:

$$C + 8 = 2(22 + 8) - 5$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$C + 8 = 2(30) - 5$$

$$C + 8 = 60 - 5$$

$$C + 8 = 55$$

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:

$$C = 47$$

Now that we have the current ages of Jame and his cousin, we can find the difference between their ages:

$$\text{Difference} = J - C$$

$$\text{Difference} = 22 - 47$$

$$\text{Difference} = -25$$

Since age cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of the difference:

$$\text{Difference} = | -25 |$$

$$\text{Difference} = 25$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the cost of one monitor, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the cost of the computer as C, the cost of the printer as P, and the cost of one monitor as M.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. C + 2M + P = 2400 (Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer)
2. C - P = 400 (The printer cost $400 less than the computer)
3. C = 1100 (Given cost of the computer)

We can substitute the value of C from equation (3) into equation (2) to find the cost of the printer:
P = C - 400
= 1100 - 400
= 700

Now that we have the cost of the printer, we can substitute the values of C and P into equation (1) to find the cost of one monitor:
1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400
Combine like terms:
1800 + 2M = 2400
Subtract 1800 from both sides:
2M = 600
Divide both sides by 2:
M = 300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Given that 20 students were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys for a scavenger hunt, we can infer that there are 10 boys and 10 girls. The boys collected 60 seashells each, resulting in a total of 10 * 60 = 600 seashells.

The girls collected an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be expressed as 60 + 4 * 60. To calculate this, we first multiply 4 and 60, which yields 240. Then, we add 60 to this result, giving us 300. Therefore, the girls collected 300 more seashells than the boys.

To find the total number of seashells collected by the girls, we add the number of seashells collected by the boys to the additional seashells collected by the girls, resulting in 600 + 300 = 900 seashells.

Since there are 10 girls, we can determine the number of seashells collected by each girl by dividing the total number of seashells collected by the girls by the number of girls: 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of candies George had as x. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, the number of candies Nick had initially is 2x.

Given that George ate 5 candies, the number of candies he has left is x - 5. We are also given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation x - 5 = 3.

Solving for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation, yielding x = 8. This represents the initial number of candies George had.

Now, we can determine the number of candies Nick had initially by substituting x = 8 into the expression 2x, which gives us 2(8) = 16.

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine Anne's age, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Chenny's age as C, Alyana's age as A, and Anne's age as N. We are given that Chenny is 10 years old, so C = 10. Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, which can be expressed as A = C - 4. Substituting the value of C, we get A = 10 - 4 = 6.

Now, we are told that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. This relationship can be represented as N = A + 2. Substituting the value of A, we get N = 6 + 2 = 8.

Therefore, Anne's age is 8 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total thickness of the four books, we can calculate the thickness of each book individually and then sum them up.

Let's denote the thickness of the first book as $b_1$, the second book as $b_2$, the third book as $b_3$, and the fourth book as $b_4$. We are given the following information:

- $b_1 = 31$ mm
- $b_2 = 50$ mm
- $b_3 = b_2 - 5 = 50 - 5 = 45$ mm
- $b_4 = 2b_1 = 2 \times 31 = 62$ mm

Now, we can calculate the total thickness of the four books by summing up their individual thicknesses:

Total thickness $= b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 = 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188$ mm

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{188}$"
"To determine the number of vlogs Emma should make to complete her monthly target, we can utilize a simple subtraction operation. Given that Emma aims to create 72 vlogs per month and has already produced 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week, we can calculate the remaining vlogs needed as follows:

Total vlogs Emma aims to make: 72
Vlogs made in the first week: 18
Vlogs made in the second week: 21
Vlogs made in the third week: 15
Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Now, we can subtract the total vlogs made from the total vlogs Emma aims to make:
72 - 54 = 18

Therefore, Emma should create 18 more vlogs to meet her monthly target.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the total amount paid, we first need to calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. This can be achieved by multiplying the bill by the decimal equivalent of 20%, which is 0.20.

The calculation is as follows:

Tip = 0.20 * $50
Tip = $10

Next, we add the tip to the original bill to obtain the total amount paid.

Total amount = $50 (bill) + $10 (tip)
Total amount = $60

Therefore, the total amount paid is $60."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach, utilizing basic algebraic manipulations and logical reasoning.

Let's denote the eldest boy's initial share as $x. Since the total amount is shared among 3 boys, we can express the initial share as $18 / 3 = $6. Therefore, we have x = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, resulting in a new amount of $6 + $5 = $11. The following day, he added another $10, bringing his total to $11 + $10 = $21.

However, he then spent $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

To find the final amount, we are told that he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. This can be expressed as 3 * $13 = $39.

Therefore, the eldest boy now has $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"To determine the daily savings amount for the second half of the month, we can approach this problem by first establishing the total number of days in the first and second halves of April. Since April has 30 days, we can divide this total by 2 to find the number of days in each half, which yields 15 days per half.

Let's denote the daily savings amount for the first half as $y. Given that Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the daily savings amount for the second half will be 2y.

The total savings for the first half of the month is the product of the daily savings amount and the number of days, which is 15y. Similarly, the total savings for the second half is 15(2y) = 30y.

The total monthly savings target is $1125. Therefore, we can set up the equation 15y + 30y = 1125 to represent the sum of the savings for the first and second halves.

Combining like terms, we get 45y = 1125. To solve for y, we divide both sides of the equation by 45, yielding y = 1125 / 45 = 25.

Since the daily savings amount for the second half is twice the daily savings amount for the first half, we can calculate this as 2y = 2(25) = 50.

Therefore, Elvis must save $50 per day in the second half of the month to meet his target.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the change Verna received after purchasing fruits, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the amount she gave.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each can be calculated as 3 \* $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each can be calculated as 5 \* $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each can be calculated as 6 \* $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny, we can calculate their total earnings based on the given rates and the number of tasks completed.

Let's denote Jairus' rate as $0.8 per task and Jenny's rate as $0.5 per task. Both of them completed 20 tasks.

Jairus' total earnings can be calculated as follows:
Jairus' total = 0.8 * 20 = $16

Similarly, Jenny's total earnings can be calculated as follows:
Jenny's total = 0.5 * 20 = $10

Now, we can find the difference in their earnings by subtracting Jenny's total from Jairus' total:
Difference = Jairus' total - Jenny's total = 16 - 10 = $6

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount Brad receives as x. Since Jeff receives 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's share can be expressed as 4x.

The total amount they are dividing is $100, so the sum of their shares is equal to 100. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 100

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 100 / 5
x = 20

Now that we have found the value of x, we can determine Jeff's share by multiplying x by 4:

Jeff's share = 4x
= 4(20)
= 80

Therefore, Jeff receives $80.

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the daily distance and then multiplying it by the number of working days.

Given that Jeff's workplace is 3 miles away, the round-trip distance for a single day is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, we can calculate the total weekly distance by multiplying the daily distance by the number of working days: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

Therefore, Jeff walks a total of 30 miles in a week.

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we can break down the problem into manageable components. 

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which yields 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters. 

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once, which is equivalent to 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

Then, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is the sum of the letters from the first two steps: 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters she has written is the sum of the letters from the first two steps and the re-write: 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 letters.

"This scenario can be modeled as a geometric progression, where the number of families notified in each round is multiplied by a constant factor. In this case, the first term (a) is 3, and the common ratio (r) is also 3.

The number of families notified in the nth round can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of a geometric progression: a_n = a * r^(n-1).

To find the number of families notified in the fourth round, we substitute a = 3, r = 3, and n = 4 into the formula:

a_4 = 3 * 3^(4-1)
     = 3 * 3^3
     = 3 * 27
     = 81

Therefore, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81.

"To determine Mark's initial weight, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Mark's initial weight as $W_i$ and the total weight lost as $W_l$. We are given that Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight lost is:

$$W_l = 10 \text{ pounds/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 30 \text{ pounds}$$

We are also given that Mark's final weight is 70 pounds. Therefore, we can express Mark's initial weight as the sum of his final weight and the total weight lost:

$$W_i = W_f + W_l = 70 \text{ pounds} + 30 \text{ pounds}$$

Simplifying the expression, we find that Mark's initial weight is:

$$W_i = 100 \text{ pounds}$$

"To determine the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we must first establish the total number of toys in the larger play set. Given that James's play set has 80 toys and the larger play set is five times larger, we can calculate this by multiplying 80 by 5.

$$80 \times 5 = 400$$

Now, we know that Jonathan requires 2 more toys than he already has to achieve the total of 400 toys. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as $x$. We can set up the equation:

$$x + 2 = 400$$

To solve for $x$, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

$$x = 400 - 2$$

$$x = 398$$

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{398}$"
"To determine the total cost of the items Daniel wants to purchase, we need to calculate the cost of each item individually and then apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

- The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is given by the product of the number of notebooks and the cost per notebook: $1.50 \* 5 = $7.50.
- The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is given by the product of the number of pens and the cost per pen: $0.25 \* 2 = $0.50.
- The cost of 1 calculator at $12 each is simply $12.
- The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 each is simply $10.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the items by summing the individual costs: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

To apply the 10% discount, we need to find 10% of the total cost, which is 0.1 \* $30 = $3. Then, we subtract this amount from the total cost to get the final cost after the discount: $30 - $3 = $27.

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

The final answer is: $27"
"To determine the change Carly receives after purchasing the items, we must first calculate the total cost of the items. This can be achieved by multiplying the quantity of each item by its respective price and summing the results.

The cost of the hamburgers is calculated as follows:

5 hamburgers at $4 each: 5 \* 4 = $20

The cost of the potato fries is calculated as follows:

10 packs of potato fries at $0.30 each: 10 \* 0.30 = $3

The cost of the fruit drinks is calculated as follows:

5 cans of fruit drinks at $2 each: 5 \* 2 = $10

The total cost of the items is the sum of the individual costs:

Total cost = $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill:

Change = $50 - $33 = $17

Therefore, Carly receives $17 in change.

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we can break down the commission structure into two components: the base commission for the initial $1000 in sales and the additional commission for the sales exceeding $1000.

The base commission rate is 30% of the initial $1000 in sales, which can be calculated as follows:

Base Commission = 0.3 \* $1000 = $300

For the sales exceeding $1000, the additional commission rate is 10% of the amount exceeding $1000, which is $1500 in this case. This can be calculated as follows:

Additional Commission = 0.1 \* $1500 = $150

The total commission earned by Antonella is the sum of the base commission and the additional commission:

Total Commission = Base Commission + Additional Commission
= $300 + $150
= $450

Therefore, Antonella's total earnings are $450."
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to purchase, we must first calculate the total number of bottles required for his party. Given that he has 70 guests and wants to provide 2 bottles of water for each guest, the total number of bottles needed is 2 * 70 = 140.

Since Bill already has 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles, he has a total of 2 * 24 = 48 bottles. To find the number of additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles required: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to purchase 92 additional bottles of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{92}$"
"To determine the time difference in swimming 3 miles between a cold day and a hot day, we first need to establish the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in each condition.

Let's denote the time to swim a mile in cold water as $t_c$ and the time to swim a mile in warm water as $t_w$. We are given that $t_c = 16$ minutes. Additionally, we know that $t_w = 2t_c + 2$.

Substituting the value of $t_c$, we get $t_w = 2(16) + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34$ minutes.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in each condition. The time to swim 3 miles in cold water is $3t_c = 3(16) = 48$ minutes, and the time to swim 3 miles in warm water is $3t_w = 3(34) = 102$ minutes.

To find the difference in time between the two conditions, we subtract the time to swim 3 miles in cold water from the time to swim 3 miles in warm water:

$\Delta t = 3t_w - 3t_c = 102 - 48 = 54$ minutes.

Therefore, the time difference is 54 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the target savings by his weekly earnings.

First, let's calculate John's daily earnings, which can be determined by multiplying his hourly wage by the number of hours he works per day:

$$
\text{Daily Earnings} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Hours Worked per Day}
$$

Given that John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, his daily earnings are:

$$
\text{Daily Earnings} = \$2 \times 5 = \$10
$$

Next, we need to calculate his weekly earnings, which can be determined by multiplying his daily earnings by the number of days he works per week:

$$
\text{Weekly Earnings} = \text{Daily Earnings} \times \text{Days Worked per Week}
$$

Since John works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:

$$
\text{Weekly Earnings} = \$10 \times 4 = \$40
$$

Now, we can divide the target savings by his weekly earnings to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80:

$$
\text{Number of Weeks} = \frac{\text{Target Savings}}{\text{Weekly Earnings}} = \frac{\$80}{\$40} = 2
$$

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Given the scenario, we can calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub by multiplying the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3, as the six-inch sub is thrice as expensive.

Let's denote the cost of the foot-long fish sub as $F = $40. The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub can be expressed as 3F.

Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub: 3F = 3($40) = $120

To find the total cost for both subs, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.

Total cost = F + 3F = $40 + $120 = $160

Therefore, the total cost for both subs is $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To determine the total number of holes in the bag of buttons, we can employ a straightforward combinatorial approach. Let's denote the number of buttons with 2 holes as $n_2$ and the number of buttons with 4 holes as $n_4$. We are given that $n_2 = 7$.

The total number of buttons in the bag is 21, so we can express this as the sum of the number of buttons with 2 holes and the number of buttons with 4 holes: $n_2 + n_4 = 21$. Solving for $n_4$, we get $n_4 = 21 - n_2 = 21 - 7 = 14$.

Now, we can calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes as $2n_2 = 2 \cdot 7 = 14$. Similarly, the total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes is $4n_4 = 4 \cdot 14 = 56$.

The total number of holes in all the buttons is the sum of the holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes: $2n_2 + 4n_4 = 14 + 56 = 70$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the size of Peter's locker, we must first establish the relative sizes of the lockers. Given that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we can express the sizes of the other lockers as fractions of this value.

Let's denote Timothy's locker as T = 24 cubic inches. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so we can express this relationship as Z = T/2. Substituting the value of T, we get Z = 24/2 = 12 cubic inches.

Now, we need to find the size of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. We can express this relationship as P = Z/4. Substituting the value of Z, we get P = 12/4 = 3 cubic inches.

Therefore, the size of Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the amount by which Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we first need to establish the current and recommended coffee consumption levels.

Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as R. Given that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, her coffee intake can be expressed as R/2. Since Juan consumes 10 times the amount of coffee his wife drinks, his current coffee intake is 10 * (R/2) = 5R.

We are informed that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. Therefore, R = 4.

Now, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake:
Juan's current coffee intake = 5R = 5 * 4 = 20 cups.

To find the amount by which Juan must reduce his coffee intake, we subtract the recommended intake from his current intake:
Reduction in coffee intake = 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"To determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Given that there are 3 cages of hamsters, each containing 10 hamsters, we can calculate the total number of hamsters as follows:

3 cages * 10 hamsters/cage = 30 hamsters

Similarly, for the 3 cages of guinea pigs, each containing 5 guinea pigs, we can calculate the total number of guinea pigs as follows:

3 cages * 5 guinea pigs/cage = 15 guinea pigs

To obtain the total number of rodents, we can simply add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together:

30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

Therefore, the pet shop has a total of 45 rodents.

The final answer is: 45"
"To determine the average weight of the three friends, we must first calculate their individual weights and then compute the arithmetic mean of these values.

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, which can be expressed as $w_S = w_M - 20$, where $w_S$ is Susan's weight and $w_M$ is Mark's weight. Substituting Mark's weight, we get $w_S = 150 - 20 = 130$ pounds.

Bob's weight is twice that of Susan's, which can be represented as $w_B = 2w_S$. Substituting Susan's weight, we find $w_B = 2 \times 130 = 260$ pounds.

The total weight of the three friends is the sum of their individual weights: $w_T = w_M + w_S + w_B = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540$ pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of individuals, which is 3. Therefore, the average weight is $\frac{w_T}{3} = \frac{540}{3} = 180$ pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To determine the final angle from the ground to the sun, we can utilize trigonometric principles, specifically the concept of angular displacement. Given that the sun is moving at a constant rate of 5 degrees per hour relative to Sahir's house, we can calculate the total angular displacement over a 10-hour period.

Let's denote the initial angle of the pyramid as θ (theta) = 32 degrees, and the angular displacement of the sun as Δθ (delta theta) = 5 degrees/hour. The total angular displacement of the sun over 10 hours is Δθ_total = Δθ * t, where t is the time in hours.

Δθ_total = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

The final angle from the ground to the sun can be calculated by adding the initial angle of the pyramid to the total angular displacement of the sun:

α (alpha) = θ + Δθ_total
= 32 degrees + 50 degrees
= 82 degrees

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 82 degrees.

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine the total number of candles James needs to purchase, we must first calculate the combined age of his two sons. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, which implies the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

The total number of candles required is the sum of their ages, which is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Given that a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we can calculate the number of packs James needs to buy by dividing the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

The cost of 4 packs of candles is then calculated as 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, the total number of minutes she read in the first week is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Given that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week by first determining the number of 1.5-minute intervals in 105 minutes. This can be done by dividing 105 by 1.5, which yields:

$$\frac{105}{1.5} = 70$$

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, the total number of pages she read in the first week is:

$$2 \times 70 = 140$$

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is the sum of the pages read in the first and second weeks:

$$140 + 100 = 240$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To determine the number of sandwiches remaining, we can start by calculating the number of sandwiches each individual consumed. 

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4$ sandwiches.

Similarly, Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3$ sandwiches.

The total number of sandwiches consumed by both Cody and Trevor is $4 + 3 = 7$ sandwiches.

To find the number of sandwiches remaining, we subtract the total number of sandwiches consumed from the initial number of sandwiches: $12 - 7 = 5$ sandwiches.

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ algebraic reasoning to determine the age of Shiloh's nephew. Let's denote the nephew's current age as x.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. At the same time, his nephew's age will be x + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be expressed as the equation 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides of the equation by 3, which yields:

$$\frac{51}{3} = x + 7$$

Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:

$$17 = x + 7$$

Next, we can isolate x by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation:

$$17 - 7 = x$$

This simplifies to:

$$x = 10$$

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break down the problem into distinct components and calculate the amount for each set of teeth.

Let's denote the amount of money the tooth fairy left for the first tooth as $5.00. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, resulting in a total of $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. Therefore, the total for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon by adding the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To determine the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, the number of goals scored by Anna as A, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. R = M + 20 (Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark)
2. R = A + 45 (Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna)
3. R = 80 (Richie scored 80 goals)

We can substitute the value of R from equation (3) into equations (1) and (2):

1. 80 = M + 20
   M = 80 - 20
   M = 60

2. 80 = A + 45
   A = 80 - 45
   A = 35

Now, we can calculate the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers:

Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers is 175."
"To determine the difference in earnings between Liam and Mitchell, we can calculate the revenue generated by each individual. Mitchell's revenue can be calculated by multiplying the number of lemonades sold (21) by the price per lemonade ($4), which yields a revenue of 21 \* 4 = $84.

Conversely, Liam's revenue is given as $63. To find the difference in earnings, we subtract Liam's revenue from Mitchell's revenue: 84 - 63 = $21.

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam selling lemonade that weekend.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and add them up.

Let's first calculate the number of wooden action figures Peter bought from Sunday through Wednesday. The cost of each wooden action figure is $5, and he spent a total of 4 days. The total amount spent on wooden action figures is 4 \* $5 = $20. Since he spent $20, he bought 20 / 5 = 4 wooden action figures.

Next, we need to calculate the number of plastic action figures Peter can buy from Thursday through Saturday. He has $70 - $20 = $50 left. The cost of each plastic action figure is $2, and he has 5 days left. The total number of plastic action figures he can buy is 50 / 2 = 25.

In total, Peter bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 4 + 25 = 29.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the total cost associated with the kitten, we must consider the expenses incurred for spaying, vaccinations, and damage to household items.

The cost of spaying the kitten is a fixed expense, amounting to $200. This is a one-time payment for the surgical procedure.

The cost of vaccinations is a variable expense, as it depends on the number of vaccinations administered. In this case, three vaccinations were administered at a cost of $20 each. Therefore, the total cost of vaccinations is 3 \* $20 = $60.

The cost of the broken vases is another variable expense, which is contingent upon the number of vases damaged and their individual cost. In this scenario, four vases were broken, each with a cost of $12. Consequently, the total cost of the broken vases is 4 \* $12 = $48.

To obtain the total cost, we must sum the costs of spaying, vaccinations, and the broken vases: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is given by the sum of the roses ordered by each shop: 
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is: 
65 roses/week × 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is: 
40 roses/week × 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we can employ a straightforward financial calculation. Given that she removes $100 from the account every month, we can model this as a linear withdrawal process.

Let's denote the initial amount in the account as A0 = $3000 and the monthly withdrawal amount as W = $100. The time period of interest is 2 years, which is equivalent to 24 months.

The total amount withdrawn from the account over 24 months can be calculated as:

W \* n = $100 \* 24 = $2400

To find the remaining amount in the account, we subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount:

A0 - W \* n = $3000 - $2400 = $600

Therefore, the remaining amount in Katina's account after 2 years is $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To determine the net profit of the food truck, we must first calculate the total cost and total revenue associated with selling 10 grilled cheese sandwiches.

The cost of bread is a fixed expense, as each loaf yields 10 sandwiches and costs $3.00. Therefore, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30 per sandwich. 

The cost of cheese and condiments is a variable expense, as it is incurred per batch of 10 sandwiches. Given that the cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00, the cost per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00 per sandwich.

The total cost per sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments: $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30 per sandwich.

The total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each is 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00.

The net profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. Since the food truck sells 10 sandwiches, the total cost is 10 sandwiches * $3.30 per sandwich = $33.00. Therefore, the net profit is $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To determine the total revenue Kate can generate from selling her muffin crayons, we must first calculate the total number of muffin crayons she can produce. Given that she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, the total number of crayons is 3 * 64 = 192.

Since each muffin crayon is created by melting 8 crayons together, the total number of muffin crayons she can produce is 192 / 8 = 24.

Now, to find the total revenue, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the selling price of each muffin crayon, which is $1.50. Therefore, the total revenue is 24 * $1.50 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the total cost of replacing the carpet in Michael's bedroom, we must consider the costs associated with the materials and labor involved in the process.

First, we calculate the area of the bedroom, which is given by the product of its length and width. The length of the bedroom is 18 feet, and the width is 12 feet. Therefore, the area of the bedroom is:

A = l × w = 18 ft × 12 ft = 216 sq ft

Next, we calculate the cost of the materials, which consists of the cost of the new carpet and the padding. The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, and the cost of the padding is $2 per square foot. Therefore, the total cost of the materials is:

Cost of materials = (Cost of carpet + Cost of padding) × Area
= ($12/sq ft + $2/sq ft) × 216 sq ft
= $14/sq ft × 216 sq ft
= $3024

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, and the cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot. Therefore, the total cost of labor is:

Cost of labor = (Cost of removal + Cost of installation) × Area
= ($4/sq ft + $34/sq ft) × 216 sq ft
= $38/sq ft × 216 sq ft
= $8208

The total cost of replacing the carpet is the sum of the cost of materials and the cost of labor:

Total cost = Cost of materials + Cost of labor
= $3024 + $8208
= $11232

The final answer is: $11232"
"To determine the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to calculate the total number of birds observed over the week and then divide it by the number of days.

The total number of birds seen can be calculated as follows:

Total birds = (50 + 50) + 0 + (120 + 120) + 20 + 90
Total birds = 100 + 0 + 240 + 20 + 90
Total birds = 450

The number of days is 7.

To find the average number of birds per day, we use the formula:

Average = Total birds / Number of days
Average = 450 / 7
Average = 64.29

Therefore, the average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 64.29.

The final answer is: 64.29"
"Given the problem, we can break it down into a series of algebraic operations to determine the final value of the number train.

Let's denote the starting value of the number train as $x$. According to the problem, the starting value plus half the number is $x + \frac{x}{2}$. This expression can be simplified to $\frac{3x}{2}$.

The resulting value is then divided by 5, so we have $\frac{3x}{2} \div 5 = \frac{3x}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{3x}{10}$.

Next, the resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 12, so we have $\frac{3x}{10} \cdot (x - 12)$.

We are given that the starting value of the number train is 20. Substituting $x = 20$ into the expression, we get:

$\frac{3(20)}{10} \cdot (20 - 12) = 6 \cdot 8 = 48$

Therefore, the final value of the number train is 48."
"To determine the total number of cards the boy and his brother have together, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Let's denote the number of cards the boy has as B and the number of cards his brother has as b.

Given that the brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, we can express this relationship as b = B - 3. Since we know the boy has 5 cards, we can substitute B = 5 into the equation, yielding b = 5 - 3 = 2.

Now, to find the total number of cards they have together, we can add the number of cards the boy and his brother have: B + b = 5 + 2 = 7.

Therefore, the total number of cards they have together is 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To address the issue of Maggie's oven being off by a constant percentage, we can model this situation using a linear equation. Let's denote the set temperature as $x$ and the actual temperature as $y$. We are given that when $x = 450$, $y = 468$. This implies that the oven is off by a constant percentage, which we can express as a linear equation in the form $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope representing the percentage by which the oven is off.

First, we need to find the slope $m$. We can do this by rearranging the equation to solve for $m$: $m = \frac{y - b}{x}$. Since the oven is off by a constant percentage, the y-intercept $b$ is 0. Therefore, $m = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{468}{450} = 1.04$.

Now that we have the slope, we can use it to find the actual temperature for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees. We can set up a proportion to find the actual temperature: $\frac{y}{x} = \frac{1.04}{1}$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = 1.04x$. Plugging in $x = 520$, we get $y = 1.04(520) = 540.8$.

However, since Maggie can't set the oven to a fraction of a degree, we need to round to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we are looking for the temperature she should set the oven to, not the actual temperature. To find the temperature she should set the oven to, we need to subtract the percentage by which the oven is off from the actual temperature. The percentage by which the oven is off is 4%, which is equivalent to 0.04. Therefore, the temperature she should set the oven to is $520 - 0.04(520) = 520 - 20.8 = 499.2$.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the temperature she should set the oven to is 499.

The final answer is: $\boxed{499}$"
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we can convert the duration of each film into minutes and then sum them. 

Let's begin by converting the duration of the first movie, which is 1 hour and 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can express this as 60 minutes + 30 minutes. This simplifies to 90 minutes.

Next, we'll convert the duration of the second movie, which is 2 hours and 5 minutes. We can express 2 hours as 2 * 60 minutes, which equals 120 minutes. Adding the 5 minutes to this gives us a total of 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we can sum the time for both movies: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

The total time Max will spend watching the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To determine the value of Juan's house, we must first calculate the difference in value between his house and Herb's house, which is 30% of Herb's house price. This can be expressed as:

Let H = Herb's house price
Juan's house price = H - 0.3H
= 0.7H

Given that Herb's house price is $76,000, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Juan's house price = 0.7($76,000)
= $53,200

Now, we can calculate the combined value of the two houses by adding their individual prices:

Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
= $76,000 + $53,200
= $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To determine the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend to the charity event, we need to calculate the number of cups and dishes each of them brought and then sum the total.

Let's denote the number of cups Judy bought as $C_J$ and the number of dishes as $D_J$. We are given that $C_J = 12$ and $D_J = 2C_J = 2 \times 12 = 24$.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so the number of cups her friend brought is $C_F = 40$ and the number of dishes is $D_F = D_J + 20 = 24 + 20 = 44$.

Now, we can calculate the total number of cups and dishes Judy brought: $C_J + D_J = 12 + 24 = 36$.

Similarly, we can calculate the total number of cups and dishes her friend brought: $C_F + D_F = 40 + 44 = 84$.

The total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend is the sum of the total number of cups and dishes each of them brought: $C_J + D_J + C_F + D_F = 36 + 84 = 120$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost per pair of contacts, we must first calculate the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will have, and then the total cost of the contacts.

Given that 90 single-use contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of pairs of contacts he uses per day as follows:

$$\frac{90 \text{ contacts}}{45 \text{ days}} = 2 \text{ contacts/day}$$

Since Pete purchases 2 boxes, he will have a total of:

$$2 \text{ boxes} \times 90 \text{ contacts/box} = 180 \text{ contacts}$$

The total number of days the contacts will last is:

$$\frac{180 \text{ contacts}}{2 \text{ contacts/day}} = 90 \text{ days}$$

Now, we can calculate the cost of 2 boxes with a 10% discount:

$$\text{Cost of 2 boxes} = 2 \times \$100/\text{box} = \$200$$

The discount is 10% of the original price:

$$\text{Discount} = \$200 \times 0.10 = \$20$$

Therefore, the total cost after the discount is:

$$\text{Total cost} = \$200 - \$20 = \$180$$

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs:

$$\text{Cost per pair} = \frac{\$180}{180 \text{ pairs}} = \$1$$

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we can calculate their individual earnings based on their respective work hours and hourly wage.

Jill worked a total of 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, resulting in a total of 3 hours of work. Given her hourly wage of $10, her total earnings can be calculated as follows:

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Therefore, John's total work hours are 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings can be calculated as follows:

John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

To find the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:

Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total energy expenditure during her physical activities. Given that she spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories per hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories per hour, we can calculate the total energy expenditure as follows:

Total energy expenditure = Energy expenditure from aerobics + Energy expenditure from running
Total energy expenditure = (2 hours * 500 calories/hour) + (1 hour * 600 calories/hour)
Total energy expenditure = 1000 calories + 600 calories
Total energy expenditure = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned, we can determine the total amount of water she needs to drink by dividing the total energy expenditure by 200 and multiplying the result by 100.

Total water needed = (Total energy expenditure / 200) * 100
Total water needed = (1600 calories / 200) * 100
Total water needed = 8 * 100
Total water needed = 800 ml

The final answer is: $\boxed{800}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of red, blue, and green jelly beans. Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can express this as the equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:

R = 0.99B

Additionally, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we have:

G = 1.01B

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3.01:

B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find R and G:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485

G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To calculate the average typing speed of Jared, we need to first determine his three typing speeds. Initially, Jared's typing speed is 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons, his typing speed increases to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, his final typing speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, let's calculate the average of the three measurements. To do this, we add up all the measurements and divide by 3. The sum of the measurements is 47 + 52 + 57 = 156. To find the average, we divide the sum by 3:

$$\frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} = \frac{156}{3} = 52$$

Therefore, the average of Jared's three typing speed measurements is 52 WPM.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52}$"
"To determine the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we can calculate the weight change for each scenario and then find the difference.

Let's denote the weight change per week as follows:
- Weight lost per week: $-1.25$ pounds
- Weight gained per week: $1.75$ pounds

Now, we can calculate the weight change after 5 weeks for each scenario:

Weight change after 5 weeks (Cheerios):
$-1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = -6.25 \text{ pounds}$

Weight change after 5 weeks (donuts):
$1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}$

The difference in weight between the two scenarios is the absolute value of the difference between the weight gained and the weight lost:
$|8.75 \text{ pounds} - (-6.25 \text{ pounds})| = |8.75 + 6.25| = 15 \text{ pounds}$

Therefore, the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 15 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of seats Alex needs, we can employ a combinatorial approach. Initially, Alex invites 100 people via email, and each of them invites 2 friends, resulting in a total of 100 + (100 * 2) = 300 people. This represents a recursive process where each person invited via email becomes a node in a social network, and their friends are the edges connecting these nodes.

However, this count does not account for the additional guests invited by Alex. She calls 10 friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses, adding 18 more people to the total. To find the total number of people attending, we sum the initial count and the additional guests: 300 + 18 = 318.

Since Alex herself is also attending, we must add 1 to the total count to ensure there are enough seats for everyone. Therefore, the total number of seats Alex needs is 318 + 1 = 319.

The final answer is: $\boxed{319}$"
"To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we can establish a linear progression of weights based on the given information. Let's denote the weight of the Affenpinscher as A, the Dachshund as D, the Papillon as P, and the Mastiff as M.

Given that the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, we can express this as D = 2A. Since the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds, we can substitute this value into the equation to obtain D = 2(10) = 20 pounds.

Next, we're told that the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. This can be represented as P = D/4. Substituting the value of D, we get P = 20/4 = 5 pounds.

Finally, the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, which can be expressed as M = 44P. Substituting the value of P, we find M = 44(5) = 220 pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{220}$"
"To determine the cost difference between purchasing the boots on Amazon and eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of each option.

The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16, and the shipping cost is $4. Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and the shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8. Thus, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference in cost between the two options, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final answer is: $1"
"This problem can be approached using exponential growth models, which are commonly used to describe population growth, financial growth, and other phenomena that exhibit rapid acceleration. In this case, we have an initial height of 4 feet, and the beanstalk doubles in height every day.

Let's denote the initial height as $h_0 = 4$ feet and the daily growth factor as $r = 2$. We want to find the number of days $n$ it takes for the beanstalk to exceed the height of Mark's window, which is 20 feet.

The height of the beanstalk after $n$ days can be modeled using the formula for exponential growth:

$$h_n = h_0 \cdot r^n$$

We want to find the smallest integer value of $n$ such that $h_n > 20$. Substituting the given values, we get:

$$4 \cdot 2^n > 20$$

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

$$2^n > 5$$

To solve for $n$, we can take the logarithm base 2 of both sides:

$$n > \log_2(5)$$

Using a calculator, we find that $\log_2(5) \approx 2.3219$. Since $n$ must be an integer, the smallest value of $n$ that satisfies the inequality is $n = 3$.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the amount of protein John consumes per week, we must first establish the protein content per unit of mushroom mass. Given that a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein percentage as follows:

Protein percentage = (Protein content / Total mass) × 100
= (3 g / 100 g) × 100
= 3%

Now, we know that John consumes 200 grams of mushrooms daily. To find the daily protein intake, we can multiply the daily mushroom mass by the protein percentage:

Daily protein intake = Daily mushroom mass × Protein percentage
= 200 g × 3%
= 200 g × 0.03
= 6 g

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the weekly protein intake by multiplying the daily protein intake by 7:

Weekly protein intake = Daily protein intake × 7
= 6 g/day × 7
= 42 g

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic reasoning. We can denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so we can write the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To determine the number of hours George needs to work to pay for the dental work, we must first calculate the total cost of the procedure. The base price of each implant is $2000, and since George requires two implants, the total base cost is 2 × $2000 = $4000.

However, one of the implants will require a crown made of porcelain, which adds an additional $500 to the total cost. Therefore, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find the number of hours George needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $\frac{\$3900}{\$15} = 260$ hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{260}$"
"Given the problem, we can apply the properties of a triangle to determine the measure of the largest angle. Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it is 3x.

The sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the number of gumballs Colby can purchase, we must first calculate the total amount of money he possesses in cents. This can be achieved by converting each denomination of currency into cents and summing the values.

The value of 8 quarters is calculated as follows: 8 × 25 cents = 200 cents.

The value of 6 dimes is calculated as follows: 6 × 10 cents = 60 cents.

The value of 14 nickels is calculated as follows: 14 × 5 cents = 70 cents.

The value of 15 pennies is calculated as follows: 15 × 1 cent = 15 cents.

Now, we can sum the values of all the coins to obtain the total amount of money Colby has: 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can determine the number of gumballs Colby can purchase by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball: 345 cents ÷ 5 cents = 69.

Therefore, Colby can purchase 69 gumballs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{69}$"
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we can calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then sum them together. 

First, let's consider the number of legs for each type of pet. Dogs, being quadruped mammals, have 4 legs each. With 5 dogs in the store, the total number of dog legs is 5 × 4 = 20. 

Cats, being quadruped mammals as well, also have 4 legs each. With 2 cats in the store, the total number of cat legs is 2 × 4 = 8.

Birds, being bipedal, have 2 legs each. With 10 birds in the store, the total number of bird legs is 10 × 2 = 20.

Now, we can sum the total number of legs together: 20 (dog legs) + 8 (cat legs) + 20 (bird legs) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we can apply a simple percentage increase calculation. The increase in weight is 50% of 8 pounds, which can be expressed as:

Weight increase = 0.5 * 8 pounds = 4 pounds

Adding this increase to the original weight of 8 pounds yields:

New weight = 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds

However, Jamaal then reduces the weight by 2 pounds. Therefore, the final weight he uses is:

Final weight = 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we can break down the problem into manageable components. Let's analyze the situation step by step.

In the first year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. Additionally, he purchases 1 game per month for 12 months, resulting in 12 games. Therefore, the total number of games Steve acquires in the first year is 10 + 12 = 22 games.

In the second year, Steve receives 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He then purchases 2 games per month for 12 months, resulting in 24 games. Consequently, the total number of games Steve acquires in the second year is 5 + 24 = 29 games.

In the third year, Steve receives 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He then purchases 4 games per month for 12 months, resulting in 48 games. Therefore, the total number of games Steve acquires in the third year is 5 + 48 = 53 games.

To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we can sum the number of games acquired each year: 22 + 29 + 53 = 104 games.

The final numerical answer is: 104"
"To determine the time it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at a constant rate, we can utilize the concept of velocity and the formula for time, which is given by:

t = d / v

where t is the time, d is the distance, and v is the velocity. 

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate its velocity as follows:

v = d / t
v = 1200 miles / 3 hours
v = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use the velocity to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles:

t = d / v
t = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
t = 5 hours

Therefore, the additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles is 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the total amount of chocolates produced by Ruiz and Marissa in a 12-hour workday, we first need to establish their individual hourly production rates.

Ruiz's hourly production rate can be calculated by dividing the total amount of chocolates he produces in two hours by 2. Given that he produces 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours, his hourly production rate is:

$$\frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour}.$$

Marissa's hourly production rate is 3/4 times Ruiz's hourly production rate. Therefore, her hourly production rate is:

$$\frac{3}{4} \cdot 60 \text{ pounds/hour} = 45 \text{ pounds/hour}.$$

Now, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates produced by each individual in a 12-hour workday:

Ruiz's total production in 12 hours is given by:

$$60 \text{ pounds/hour} \cdot 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}.$$

Marissa's total production in 12 hours is given by:

$$45 \text{ pounds/hour} \cdot 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds}.$$

The total amount of chocolates produced by both Ruiz and Marissa in a 12-hour workday is the sum of their individual productions:

$$720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds}.$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"
"To determine the amount of money Howard has left, we can calculate the total amount spent at the arcade and subtract it from the original amount.

Let's denote the amount spent on Monday as M. We are given that M = $8.

On Tuesday, Howard spends twice as much as Monday, so the amount spent on Tuesday is 2M = 2 * $8 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as Tuesday, so the amount spent on Wednesday is 4 * 2M = 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount spent at the arcade is the sum of the amounts spent on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:
M + 2M + 4M = 7M
Substituting M = $8, we get:
7M = 7 * $8 = $56

However, this is not the correct total amount spent. We need to consider the correct sequence of events. The correct sequence is:
- Monday: $8
- Tuesday: 2 * $8 = $16
- Wednesday: 4 * $16 = $64

The total amount spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Howard originally had $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount:
$100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the revenue generated from each period and then summing the results.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the initial four hours. During this period, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.50 per cup. The total number of cups sold in this period is given by the product of the hourly sales and the number of hours:

$$\text{Total cups sold in 4 hours} = 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups}$$

The revenue generated from this period is then calculated by multiplying the total number of cups sold by the price per cup:

$$\text{Revenue in 4 hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30$$

Next, we calculate the revenue from the subsequent two hours. During this period, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.60 per cup. The total number of cups sold in this period is given by the product of the hourly sales and the number of hours:

$$\text{Total cups sold in 2 hours} = 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups}$$

The revenue generated from this period is then calculated by multiplying the total number of cups sold by the price per cup:

$$\text{Revenue in 2 hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12$$

To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we sum the revenues from both periods:

$$\text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue in 4 hours} + \text{Revenue in 2 hours} = \$30 + \$12 = \$42$$

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the lifespan of the tires, we need to calculate the total number of rotations they can undergo before needing replacement and then divide that by the number of rotations per month.

Given that the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the total number of rotations per mile as follows:

Rotations per mile = 725 rotations / 2 miles
Rotations per mile = 362.5 rotations/mile

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles per month, the total number of rotations per month is:

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 362.5 rotations/mile
Rotations per month = 145,000 rotations/month

Now, we can calculate the total number of months the tires can last before needing replacement:

Total rotations allowed = 10,440,000 rotations
Rotations per month = 145,000 rotations/month

Months before replacement = Total rotations allowed / Rotations per month
Months before replacement = 10,440,000 / 145,000
Months before replacement = 72

To find the number of years, we divide the total months by 12:

Years before replacement = Months before replacement / 12
Years before replacement = 72 / 12
Years before replacement = 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the cost per pump of the shampoo, we must first establish the total number of pumps contained within the jumbo bottle. Given that 2 pumps yield 120 washings, and Jackie utilizes 1 pump per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents. To calculate the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

Therefore, the cost per pump of the shampoo is 10 cents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and subtract it from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt:
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 \* $25 = $7.50

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt:
Discounted price of the shirt = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
Total cost = Discounted price of the shirt + Price of the shorts
Total cost = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we do not need to calculate it separately. Now, let's calculate the amount of money Joe will have left:
Amount left = Initial amount - Total cost
Amount left = $50 - $52.50 = -$2.50

Therefore, Joe will have $2.50 less than he initially had, which means he does not have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: $-2.50"
"To determine the total amount of butter required to produce 4 dozen croissants per day for a week, we must first calculate the total number of croissants to be produced. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of croissants is given by:

Total number of croissants = 4 dozen/day * 7 days
= 4 * 12 * 7
= 336 croissants

Given that 1/4 pound of butter is required to make 1 dozen croissants, we can calculate the total amount of butter needed as follows:

Total amount of butter = Total number of croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant)
= 336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant)
= 336 * 0.25
= 84 pounds

Therefore, the total amount of butter required to produce 4 dozen croissants per day for a week is 84 pounds.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the cost difference in repaving Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we must first calculate the cost of repaving each street. The cost per meter is $194, and the lengths of the streets are 150 meters and 490 meters, respectively.

The cost to repave Monica's street can be calculated as follows:

Cost to repave Monica's street = Cost per meter × Length of Monica's street
= $194 × 150
= $29,100

Similarly, the cost to repave Lewis' street is:

Cost to repave Lewis' street = Cost per meter × Length of Lewis' street
= $194 × 490
= $95,060

To find the difference in cost, we subtract the cost to repave Monica's street from the cost to repave Lewis' street:

Difference in cost = Cost to repave Lewis' street - Cost to repave Monica's street
= $95,060 - $29,100
= $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to calculate the cost for the initial 5 months and the cost for the remaining 45 months.

The initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000. This is a fixed cost, which we can denote as C_initial = $100,000.

For the remaining 45 months, the funding is 50% more than the initial funding. This can be expressed as a multiplier, m = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5, which represents a 50% increase. Therefore, the funding for the remaining months is C_remaining = C_initial * m = $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000 per month.

The total cost for the remaining 45 months is the product of the monthly cost and the number of months: C_remaining * 45 = $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the cost for the initial 5 months and the cost for the remaining 45 months:
C_total = C_initial + C_remaining * 45 = $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

The final answer is: $6,850,000"
"To determine the total amount of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to calculate the amount eaten by each player. 

The first player consumed a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player consumed 8 beef tips, each weighing 1 ounce, resulting in a total of 8 ounces of beef tips. 
The third player consumed a 1-pound steak, which is equivalent to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

To find the total amount of meat consumed, we can add the individual amounts together: 
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total number of posts in March, we need to calculate the daily posting rate and then multiply it by the number of days in the month.

Given that there are 1000 members in the Reddit group, each posting an average of 3 posts per day, the daily posting rate can be calculated as follows:

Daily posting rate = Number of members * Posts per member per day
= 1000 members * 3 posts/member
= 3000 posts/day

Since March has 31 days, the total number of posts in March can be calculated by multiplying the daily posting rate by the number of days:

Total posts in March = Daily posting rate * Number of days in March
= 3000 posts/day * 31 days
= 93,000 posts

Therefore, the total number of posts in March is 93,000."
"To determine the annual expenditure on water for laundry, we must first calculate the total volume of water utilized for this purpose. Given that Gary performs laundry twice a week, the frequency of laundry can be expressed as 2 loads per week. Since there are 52 weeks in a standard year, the total number of laundry loads in a year is 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year.

Each load of laundry requires 20 gallons of water. Therefore, the total volume of water used for laundry in a year is 104 loads/year * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons/year.

The cost of water is $0.15 per gallon. Consequently, the annual expenditure on water for laundry is 2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year.

The final answer is: $312"
"To determine the total amount Scarlett spent, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations to calculate the cost of each item and then sum the results.

First, we identify the individual costs:

1. The aquarium costs $10.00.
2. The cost of 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each is 2 × $2.50 = $5.00.
3. The cost of 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each is 3 × $2.00 = $6.00.
4. The cost of 20 fish at $0.50 each is 20 × $0.50 = $10.00.
5. The cost of the fish food is $2.00.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by summing these individual expenses:

Total cost = $10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food)
Total cost = $33.00

The final answer is: $33.00"
"To determine the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we can apply a step-by-step approach based on the given information.

Initially, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall. In the second week, it doubled in height, resulting in a height of 3 × 2 = 6 inches. 

Subsequently, in the third week, the beanstalk grew an additional 4 inches. Therefore, the total height at the end of the third week can be calculated as follows:

Height after 3 weeks = Initial height + (Initial height × 2) + Additional growth
= 3 + (3 × 2) + 4
= 3 + 6 + 4
= 13 inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat he sells in a day and then divide the total weight of the bull's meat by that amount.

Prince's daily meat sales can be calculated as the product of the amount of meat he sells per hour and the number of hours he works in a day. Given that he sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, his daily sales can be expressed as:

Daily sales = 15 kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150 kg/day

Now, we can calculate the number of days it will take to sell the meat from the bull by dividing the total weight of the bull's meat by Prince's daily sales:

Number of days = Total weight of bull's meat / Daily sales
= 750 kg / 150 kg/day
= 5 days

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of students in the school auditorium, we first calculate the total number of seats available. Given that there are 4 rows of seats with 18 seats in each row, the total number of seats can be computed as follows:

Total seats = Number of rows × Number of seats per row
Total seats = 4 × 18
Total seats = 72

Next, we need to find the number of seats occupied by the administrators, which is one-fourth of the total number of seats.

Administrators = (1/4) × Total seats
Administrators = (1/4) × 72
Administrators = 18

Now, we calculate the remaining seats after accounting for the administrators.

Remaining seats = Total seats - Administrators
Remaining seats = 72 - 18
Remaining seats = 54

Subsequently, we determine the number of seats occupied by the parents, which is one-third of the remaining seats.

Parents = (1/3) × Remaining seats
Parents = (1/3) × 54
Parents = 18

Finally, we calculate the number of seats occupied by the students by subtracting the number of parents from the remaining seats.

Students = Remaining seats - Parents
Students = 54 - 18
Students = 36

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the total number of functioning street lights, we must first calculate the total number of street lights and then subtract the number of non-functioning lights.

Given that each pole at a road intersection has 4 street lights and there are 6 poles at each intersection, the total number of poles can be calculated as follows:

Total number of poles = Number of poles per intersection * Number of intersections
Total number of poles = 6 * 4
Total number of poles = 24

Since each pole has 4 street lights, the total number of street lights is:

Total number of street lights = Total number of poles * Number of street lights per pole
Total number of street lights = 24 * 4
Total number of street lights = 96

However, it is given that 20 street lights are not functioning. Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights can be calculated as follows:

Total number of functioning street lights = Total number of street lights - Number of non-functioning street lights
Total number of functioning street lights = 96 - 20
Total number of functioning street lights = 76

The final answer is: 76"
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to consider the remaining lifespan of each DVD. Given that a DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks, we can calculate the remaining lifespan of each DVD by subtracting the number of times it has already been played from its total lifespan.

Let's denote the number of times DVD 1 has been played as $n_1 = 356$ and the number of times DVD 2 has been played as $n_2 = 135$. The remaining lifespan of each DVD can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Remaining lifespan of DVD 1} = 1000 - n_1 = 1000 - 356 = 644
$$

$$
\text{Remaining lifespan of DVD 2} = 1000 - n_2 = 1000 - 135 = 865
$$

To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we add the remaining lifespans of both DVDs:

$$
\text{Total remaining lifespan} = 644 + 865 = 1509
$$

Therefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1509}$"
"To determine the total cost of John's physical therapy, we must first calculate the total number of hours he attended physical therapy sessions. Given that he attended therapy for 6 weeks, twice a week, for 2 hours at a time, we can calculate the total number of sessions as follows:

Total number of sessions = 6 weeks * 2 sessions/week = 12 sessions

Since each session lasted for 2 hours, the total number of hours can be calculated as:

Total hours = 12 sessions * 2 hours/session = 24 hours

The cost per hour of physical therapy is $125. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated as:

Total cost = Total hours * Cost per hour
           = 24 hours * $125/hour
           = $3000

The total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000."
"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we can break down his gum consumption into distinct categories.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school, and the school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the number of pieces he chews at school as follows:

$$\frac{8\text{ hours}}{2\text{ hours/piece}} = 4\text{ pieces}$$

In addition to the pieces he chews at school, Jim also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. Therefore, the total number of pieces he chews is:

$$4\text{ pieces} + 1\text{ piece} + 1\text{ piece} = 6\text{ pieces}$$

Initially, Jim has 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has:

$$20\text{ pieces} - 6\text{ pieces} = 14\text{ pieces}$$

However, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. To find the number of pieces he gives to his sister, we can divide the remaining pieces by 2:

$$\frac{14\text{ pieces}}{2} = 7\text{ pieces}$$

Therefore, Jim gives 7 pieces to his sister. To find the number of pieces he has left, we subtract the number of pieces he gave to his sister from the remaining pieces:

$$14\text{ pieces} - 7\text{ pieces} = 7\text{ pieces}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote her current age as 'x'. Since she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can express this relationship as:

x + 12 = 16

To find her current age, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

x = 16 - 12
x = 4

Now that we have her current age, we can calculate her age 4 years from now by adding 4 to her current age:

Age 4 years from now = x + 4
Age 4 years from now = 4 + 4
Age 4 years from now = 8

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the difference in expenditure between the two coaches, we can calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference.

The baseball coach purchased 9 new baseballs at a unit price of $3 each. Therefore, the total expenditure for the baseball coach can be calculated as follows:

Total expenditure for baseball coach = Number of baseballs × Unit price per baseball
= 9 × $3
= $27

The basketball coach, on the other hand, purchased 8 new basketballs at a unit price of $14 each. Consequently, the total expenditure for the basketball coach can be calculated as follows:

Total expenditure for basketball coach = Number of basketballs × Unit price per basketball
= 8 × $14
= $112

To find the difference in expenditure between the two coaches, we can subtract the total expenditure of the baseball coach from that of the basketball coach:

Difference in expenditure = Total expenditure for basketball coach - Total expenditure for baseball coach
= $112 - $27
= $85

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.

The final answer is: $85"
"To determine the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers. Given that there are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row, the total number of flowers can be calculated as follows:

Total number of flowers = Number of rows × Number of flowers per row
= 10 × 20
= 200

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we can calculate the number of bloomed flowers by multiplying the total number of flowers by 4/5:

Number of bloomed flowers = Total number of flowers × (4/5)
= 200 × (4/5)
= (4 × 200) / 5
= 800 / 5
= 160

Therefore, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we must first convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s. This can be achieved by dividing her speed in kb/s by 1000, as there are 1000 kilobytes (kb) in a megabyte (Mb).

Given that Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kb/s, we can express this conversion as follows:

$$
\text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{\text{Speed in kb/s}}{1000} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s}
$$

Next, we need to convert her speed from Mb/s to Mb/hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we can multiply her speed in Mb/s by 3600 to obtain her speed in Mb/hour:

$$
\text{Speed in Mb/hour} = \text{Speed in Mb/s} \times 3600 = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 = 72 \text{ Mb/hour}
$$

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb/hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the total number of cars towed by the truck, we can break down the problem into two distinct periods: the first three days and the remaining days of the week.

During the first three days, the truck towed 10 cars per day. Therefore, the total number of cars towed during this period is given by the product of the number of days and the number of cars towed per day: $3 \times 10 = 30$.

For the remaining days, the truck towed 4 fewer cars per day, resulting in a daily total of $10 - 4 = 6$ cars. Since there are 4 remaining days, the total number of cars towed during this period is $4 \times 6 = 24$.

To find the total number of cars towed that week, we add the number of cars towed during the first three days and the remaining days: $30 + 24 = 54$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Adam to reach the required height to ride the roller coaster, we can employ a simple linear growth model. Given that Adam's height is currently 40 inches and he grows at a rate of 2 inches per year, we can calculate the time it will take for him to reach the required height of 48 inches.

Let's denote the number of years it will take for Adam to reach the required height as 't'. We can then set up the following equation based on the linear growth model:

40 + 2t = 48

To solve for 't', we can subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

2t = 8

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate 't':

t = 8 / 2
t = 4

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to reach the required height to ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine James' earnings from selling the used cars, we need to calculate the profit from the transactions and then apply his commission rate to that profit.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cars. Since James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, the total revenue is given by:

R = 10 \* $25,000 = $250,000

Next, we need to calculate the company's cost to acquire the cars, which is 30% of the total revenue. This can be expressed as:

C = 0.3 \* R = 0.3 \* $250,000 = $75,000

Now, we can calculate the profit from the transactions by subtracting the company's cost from the total revenue:

Profit = R - C = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

Finally, we need to calculate James' commission on the profit. His commission rate is 10%, which can be expressed as a decimal by dividing by 100:

Commission Rate = 10% = 0.1

Now, we can calculate James' commission by multiplying the profit by his commission rate:

Commission = Profit \* Commission Rate = $175,000 \* 0.1 = $17,500

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To determine the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright. Given that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we can express this as a proportion:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we can express this as a proportion:

Number of women who can stay upright = 0.6 * 25 = 15

Now, to find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

Number of men who can stay upright = Total number of riders who can stay upright - Number of women who can stay upright
= 25 - 15
= 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can establish a relationship between the prices of the three jewels. Let's denote the price of the diamond jewel as D, the price of the gold jewel as G, and the price of the silver jewel as S.

We are given that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

G = (4/5)D

Substituting the given value of D, we get:

G = (4/5) * 2000
G = 1600

We are also given that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. This can be expressed as:

S = G - 400

Substituting the value of G, we get:

S = 1600 - 400
S = 1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = D + G + S
= 2000 + 1600 + 1200
= 4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we can utilize a systematic approach by breaking down the given information. 

Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R. We are given that S = 16. 

We also know that Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, which can be expressed as T = S + 3. Substituting the value of S, we get T = 16 + 3 = 19.

Furthermore, we are informed that Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, which can be represented as R = T - 9. Substituting the value of T, we get R = 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, to find the total number of stamps Max bought, we can simply add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps: S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

Therefore, the total number of stamps Max bought is 45.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To determine the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob, we can utilize the concept of relative motion. The relative speed between the two individuals is the difference between their speeds, which is 70 mph (Tom's speed) - 55 mph (Bob's speed) = 15 mph.

The distance between them is 75 miles. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Relative Speed

Substituting the given values, we get:

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph

Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Given that Naomi caught 17 fish, we can establish a linear relationship between the number of fish caught by each individual. Let's denote the number of fish caught by Darren as D and the number of fish caught by Tommy as T.

We are given that Darren caught 6 fewer fish than Naomi, so we can express this as D = 17 - 6. This simplifies to D = 11.

Furthermore, we are told that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, which can be expressed as T = D + 3. Substituting the value of D, we get T = 11 + 3.

Therefore, T = 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny attends at $6 per class as x and the number of classes he attends at $10 per class as y. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

We can set up the following equation:

6x + 10y = 60

Since Manny can't attend a fraction of a class, we need to find the maximum whole number of classes he can attend at $6 per class.

We can start by trying different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

To simplify the equation, we can divide both sides by 2:

3x + 5y = 30

Now, we can try different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

If x = 1, 3(1) + 5y = 30
3 + 5y = 30
5y = 27
y = 5.4 (not a whole number)

If x = 2, 3(2) + 5y = 30
6 + 5y = 30
5y = 24
y = 4.8 (not a whole number)

If x = 3, 3(3) + 5y = 30
9 + 5y = 30
5y = 21
y = 4.2 (not a whole number)

If x = 4, 3(4) + 5y = 30
12 + 5y = 30
5y = 18
y = 3.6 (not a whole number)

If x = 5, 3(5) + 5y = 30
15 + 5y = 30
5y = 15
y = 3

Since x = 5 and y = 3 is a whole number solution, Manny can attend 5 classes at $6 per class and 3 classes at $10 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to calculate their individual daily and weekly production rates.

Jewel's daily production rate is given as 50 customers. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production rate can be calculated as follows:

Jewel's weekly production rate = 50 customers/day * 7 days/week = 350 customers/week

Given that Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, her daily production rate is twice that of Jewel's:

Julie's daily production rate = 2 * Jewel's daily production rate = 2 * 50 customers/day = 100 customers/day

Julie's weekly production rate can be calculated as follows:

Julie's weekly production rate = 100 customers/day * 7 days/week = 700 customers/week

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly production rates:

Total weekly production = Jewel's weekly production rate + Julie's weekly production rate
= 350 customers/week + 700 customers/week
= 1050 customers/week

The final answer is: $\boxed{1050}$"
"To determine the distance Lynn ran, we can establish a relationship between the distances covered by Reggie, Lynn, and Paisley. 

Let's denote the distance Lynn ran as L, the distance Reggie ran as R, and the distance Paisley ran as P. We are given that P = 4 miles. 

We also know that Reggie ran 5 times the distance Paisley ran, so R = 5P = 5(4) = 20 miles. 

Furthermore, we are told that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, which can be expressed as R = L + 3. Substituting the value of R, we get 20 = L + 3. 

To find the value of L, we can solve for L by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: L = 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we can first calculate the unit price of each fruit. The unit price is the cost per unit of the item, which in this case is the cost per apple and the cost per orange.

Let's denote the cost of 4 apples as $5.20 and the cost of 3 oranges as $3.30. We can calculate the unit price of each fruit by dividing the cost by the quantity.

Unit price of an apple = Cost of 4 apples / 4 = $5.20 / 4 = $1.30
Unit price of an orange = Cost of 3 oranges / 3 = $3.30 / 3 = $1.10

Now, we can calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges by multiplying the unit price of each fruit by the desired quantity.

Cost of 5 apples = Unit price of an apple * 5 = $1.30 * 5 = $6.50
Cost of 5 oranges = Unit price of an orange * 5 = $1.10 * 5 = $5.50

The total cost is the sum of the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges.

Total cost = Cost of 5 apples + Cost of 5 oranges = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine the time required to dig the hole, we must first calculate the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the hole, is given by the formula:

V = lwh

where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth) of the prism.

Given that the length (l) is 6 feet, the width (w) is 4 feet, and the depth (h) is 3 feet, we can calculate the volume as follows:

V = lwh
= (6 ft)(4 ft)(3 ft)
= 72 cubic feet

Next, we need to determine the time required to dig the hole. Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can calculate the total time required by multiplying the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

t = V * t_per_cubic_foot
= 72 cubic feet * 3 seconds/cubic foot
= 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

The final answer is: $\boxed{216}$"
"To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we must first identify the cost of each feature and then sum these costs with the base price of the vehicle.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500. This is a fixed cost, which we will add to the base price.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so we can express their cost as a fraction of the king cab upgrade: $\frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = \frac{7,500}{3} = 2,500$. This is a straightforward application of arithmetic.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so their cost can be expressed as: $2,500 - 500 = 2,000$. This is a simple subtraction operation.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500. This is a fixed cost that we will add to the total.

Now, let's calculate the total cost by summing the base price, the king cab upgrade, the leather seats, the running boards, and the upgraded exterior light package:

$30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To determine Tim's total annual income, we must first calculate his new monthly salary after the 5% raise and then add the bonus, which is equivalent to half a month's salary.

The 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Raise} = 0.05 \times 20,000 = 1,000
$$

Thus, his new monthly salary is:

$$
\text{New Monthly Salary} = 20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000
$$

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is:

$$
\text{Bonus} = \frac{20,000}{2} = 10,000
$$

Now, we can calculate the total monthly income by adding the new monthly salary and the bonus:

$$
\text{Total Monthly Income} = 21,000 + 10,000 = 31,000
$$

To find the total annual income, we multiply the total monthly income by 12:

$$
\text{Total Annual Income} = 31,000 \times 12 = 372,000
$$

The final answer is: $372,000"
"To determine the total cost of James' wardrobe, we can break down the expenses into three categories: suits, dress pants, and dress shirts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits. The cost of each suit is $750. Since James purchases 10 suits, the total cost of the suits is given by the product of the number of suits and the cost per suit:

$$\text{Cost of suits} = 10 \times 750 = 7500$$

Next, we calculate the cost of the dress pants. The cost of each dress pant is 1/5 of the cost of a suit, which is $750. Therefore, the cost of each dress pant is $750 \times \frac{1}{5} = 150. Since James purchases 10 dress pants, the total cost of the dress pants is:

$$\text{Cost of dress pants} = 10 \times 150 = 1500$$

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James purchases 3 dress shirts per suit, and since he buys 10 suits, the total number of dress shirts is 10 \times 3 = 30. The cost of each dress shirt is $60, so the total cost of the dress shirts is:

$$\text{Cost of dress shirts} = 30 \times 60 = 1800$$

To find the total cost of James' wardrobe, we add up the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts:

$$\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of suits} + \text{Cost of dress pants} + \text{Cost of dress shirts} = 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800$$

The final answer is: $10800"
"To determine the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by each website and then add them together.

The news website publishes an average of 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. Therefore, the total number of articles published by the news website can be calculated as follows:

Total articles (news website) = 20 articles/day * 28 days
= 20 * 28
= 560 articles

The sister company publishes an average of 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. Consequently, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:

Total articles (sister company) = 10 articles/day * 28 days
= 10 * 28
= 280 articles

Now, we can calculate the total number of articles published by both websites by adding the total number of articles published by each website:

Total articles = Total articles (news website) + Total articles (sister company)
= 560 articles + 280 articles
= 840 articles

The final answer is: $\boxed{840}$"
"To determine the age of Steve's son's wife, we can break down the information provided into a series of logical steps.

Let's denote Steve's age as S, his wife's age as W, their son's age as C, and their son's wife's age as SW. We are given the following information:

1. S = 60
2. W = S + 4
3. C = W / 2
4. SW = C - 3

Substituting the value of S into equation (2), we get W = 60 + 4 = 64.

Now, we can substitute the value of W into equation (3) to find C: C = 64 / 2 = 32.

Finally, we can substitute the value of C into equation (4) to find SW: SW = 32 - 3 = 29.

Therefore, the age of Steve's son's wife is 29 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

Given that each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion. This yields:

Total flour in one bag = Number of portions × Weight of each portion
= 8 × 2 kg
= 16 kg

Now, to find the total amount of flour in three bags, we can simply multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3:

Total flour in three bags = Total flour in one bag × 3
= 16 kg × 3
= 48 kg

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms.

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we can apply the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time. 

For Alisa, the distance traveled is given by $d_A = s_A \cdot t_A$, where $s_A$ is her speed (12 miles per hour) and $t_A$ is the time she biked (4.5 hours). Substituting the given values, we obtain $d_A = 12 \cdot 4.5 = 54$ miles.

Similarly, for Stanley, the distance traveled is given by $d_S = s_S \cdot t_S$, where $s_S$ is his speed (10 miles per hour) and $t_S$ is the time he biked (2.5 hours). Substituting the given values, we obtain $d_S = 10 \cdot 2.5 = 25$ miles.

To find the total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley, we add their individual distances: $d_{total} = d_A + d_S = 54 + 25 = 79$ miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{79}$"
"To determine the time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add them together.

The rate at which Bill can dig through soil is 4 feet/hour, and the rate at which he can dig through clay is half that, or 2 feet/hour. 

The time it takes to dig through the soil can be calculated as follows:

Time to dig through soil = Depth of soil / Rate of digging through soil
= 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
= 6 hours

The time it takes to dig through the clay can be calculated as follows:

Time to dig through clay = Depth of clay / Rate of digging through clay
= 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
= 4 hours

The total time to dig the well is the sum of the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay:

Total time to dig the well = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
= 6 hours + 4 hours
= 10 hours

Therefore, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 10 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie needs to purchase, we must first calculate the total number of individuals in his class, including himself, his teacher, and his classmates. This can be represented as the sum of the number of classmates and the additional individuals (Howie and his teacher).

Let's denote the number of classmates as $n$. The total number of individuals is then given by $n + 2$.

We are given that the number of classmates is 25. Therefore, the total number of individuals is $25 + 2 = 27$.

Since Howie wants to purchase one vanilla and one chocolate cupcake for each individual, we need to multiply the total number of individuals by 2 to account for both flavors.

The total number of cupcakes required is $2 \times (n + 2) = 2 \times 27 = 54$.

Therefore, Howie should purchase 54 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach based on the given information.

Let's denote the initial number of likes as L. We are given that Fishio received 2000 likes initially, so L = 2000.

After 1 week, the number of likes remains the same, which is 2000.

Three weeks later, the number of likes is 70 times the initial number of likes. Therefore, the number of likes after 3 weeks is 70L = 70(2000) = 140000.

However, we are also given that Fishio received 20000 more new likes recently. This implies that the number of likes after 3 weeks is the sum of the initial likes, the likes received in the 3 weeks, and the 20000 new likes.

Let's denote the number of likes received in the 3 weeks as x. Then, we can write the equation:

L + x + 20000 = 140000

Substituting L = 2000, we get:

2000 + x + 20000 = 140000

Combine like terms:

21000 + x = 140000

Subtract 21000 from both sides:

x = 119000

Now, we can find the total number of likes by adding the initial likes, the likes received in the 3 weeks, and the 20000 new likes:

Total likes = L + x + 20000
= 2000 + 119000 + 20000
= 138000 + 20000
= 158000

The final answer is: $\boxed{158000}$"
"To determine the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two costs.

On the first day, Clara purchased 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she received a $2 discount due to a voucher. The total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Number of pomegranates × Price per pomegranate - Discount
= 20 × $20 - $2
= $398

On the second day, the price per pomegranate increased to $30, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost without the discount is:

Total cost without discount = Number of pomegranates × Price per pomegranate
= 20 × $30
= $600

The discount is 10% of the total cost without the discount, which is:

Discount = 0.1 × Total cost without discount
= 0.1 × $600
= $60

The total cost with the discount is:

Total cost with discount = Total cost without discount - Discount
= $600 - $60
= $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

Difference = Total cost on the first day - Total cost on the second day
= $398 - $540
= -$142

The final answer is: $142"
"Given the scenario, let's analyze the sales data for Ariadne's shop.

Let's denote the total sales from green hats in the first month as $x. Since the sales from red hats in the first month are half the total sales from green hats, we can express this as:

$$\frac{1}{2}x = 400$$

To find the value of x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

$$x = 400 \times 2 = 800$$

Thus, the total sales from green hats in the first month are $800, and the total sales from red hats are $400.

The total sales in the first month are the sum of the sales from green and red hats:

$$\text{Total Sales (First Month)} = 800 + 400 = 1200$$

In the second month, the sales are 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. We can express this as:

$$\text{Sales (Second Month)} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900$$

To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months:

$$\text{Total Sales (Two Months)} = 1200 + 900 = 2100$$

The final answer is: $2100"
"To determine the total cost of hiring the horse-drawn carriage, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the total cost of those hours.

Let's denote the cost of the first hour as $15. Since each subsequent hour costs twice the cost of the first hour, we can express the cost of the second hour as 2 * $15 = $30, and the cost of the third hour as 2 * $30 = $60.

Given that James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a 4-hour period, and he receives 1 hour of free service, he is only charged for 3 hours. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Cost of the first hour + Cost of the second hour + Cost of the third hour
= $15 + $30 + $60
= $105

The final answer is: $105"
"To determine the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we can apply a simple arithmetic operation. Given that her bank account initially held $200 and now holds $420, and considering she received no external deposits, we can infer that the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount in her account represents the amount withheld.

Let's denote Sally's expected weekly wage as W. We know that her initial account balance was $200, and her expected total balance after receiving her full wage would be W + $200. However, we observe that her current account balance is $420, indicating that the amount withheld from her wage is the difference between her expected total balance and the actual balance.

Mathematically, we can express this as:

W + $200 = $420

To find the amount withheld, we need to isolate W. Subtracting $200 from both sides of the equation yields:

W = $420 - $200
W = $220

However, this is the amount she should have received, not the amount withheld. To find the amount withheld, we subtract the actual amount she received from her expected wage:

Amount withheld = W - $420
Amount withheld = $220 - $420
Amount withheld = -$200

Since we cannot have a negative amount withheld, this indicates that Sally actually received more than her expected wage. However, this is not the case, as we are looking for the amount withheld. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Given that Sally's bank account initially held $200 and now holds $420, and considering she received no external deposits, we can infer that the amount withheld from her wage is the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount in her account. However, the correct approach is to find the difference between her expected total balance and the actual balance, not the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount in her account.

Let's re-evaluate the problem:

Expected total balance = W + $200
Actual balance = $420

We know that the amount withheld is the difference between the expected total balance and the actual balance. However, we are given that her expected wage is $300, not the expected total balance. To find the amount withheld, we can subtract the actual balance from the expected total balance, but we need to first find the expected total balance.

Expected total balance = $300 + $200
Expected total balance = $500

Now, we can find the amount withheld:

Amount withheld = Expected total balance - Actual balance
Amount withheld = $500 - $420
Amount withheld = $80

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Lori needs for her party, we must first calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required. Given that each guest will consume 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests, we can calculate the total number of deviled egg halves as follows:

Total deviled egg halves = Number of guests × Number of deviled egg halves per guest
= 16 × 3
= 48

Since each whole egg yields 2 deviled egg halves, we can calculate the total number of eggs needed by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2:

Total eggs = Total deviled egg halves ÷ 2
= 48 ÷ 2
= 24

To determine the number of dozens of eggs needed, we divide the total number of eggs by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen:

Number of dozens of eggs = Total eggs ÷ 12
= 24 ÷ 12
= 2

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs for her party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we can utilize the concept of fractions. Since she has completed 1/3 of the paper, we can calculate the remaining portion by subtracting the completed fraction from the whole.

Let's denote the total number of pages as P. We know that Shiela has completed 1/3 of the paper, so the number of pages she has already written is (1/3)P. To find the number of pages left to write, we can subtract this value from the total number of pages:

Pages left to write = P - (1/3)P
Pages left to write = (2/3)P

Given that the total number of pages is 15, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Pages left to write = (2/3)(15)
Pages left to write = 10

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the number of days before the deadline that Mike will finish his reading, we can employ a straightforward calculation based on his reading rate and the total number of pages in the book.

Let's denote the total number of pages in the book as P, the number of pages Mike reads per day as R, and the total number of days he has to complete the assignment as D. We are given that P = 200 and R = 10.

The time it takes Mike to finish the book can be calculated as the total number of pages divided by the number of pages he reads per day, which is P/R = 200/10 = 20 days.

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we can find the number of days before the deadline by subtracting the time it takes him to finish the book from the total number of days: D - (P/R) = 30 - 20 = 10 days.

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total cost of acquiring and maintaining the plane for the first year, we must consider the initial purchase price, the recurring costs associated with hanger rental, and fuel expenses.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000. This is a fixed cost that is incurred only once.

The monthly hanger rental fee is $5,000. To calculate the annual hanger rental cost, we multiply this monthly fee by the number of months in a year, which is 12. Therefore, the annual hanger rental cost is $5,000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is stated to be twice the hanger rental fee, which is $10,000 per month. To calculate the annual fuel cost, we multiply this monthly fee by 12, resulting in $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

The total cost for the first year is the sum of the initial purchase price, the annual hanger rental cost, and the annual fuel cost: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final numerical answer is: $330,000"
"To determine the total cooking time for Finley's meal, we can utilize a systematic approach by first identifying the individual cooking times for each ingredient and then summing these values.

Let's denote the cooking time for rice as $r$, the cooking time for pork as $p$, and the cooking time for beans as $b$. We are given that $r = 30$ minutes.

We also know that the cooking time for pork is 20 minutes greater than the cooking time for rice, which can be expressed as $p = r + 20$. Substituting the given value for $r$, we find that $p = 30 + 20 = 50$ minutes.

Furthermore, we are informed that the cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is $r + p = 30 + 50 = 80$ minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is $b = \frac{1}{2}(r + p) = \frac{1}{2}(80) = 40$ minutes.

To find the total cooking time, we sum the individual cooking times for each ingredient: $t = r + p + b = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120$ minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost difference between two mixtures of almonds and walnuts, we can calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

Let's denote the cost of almonds as $A and the cost of walnuts as $W. Given that a pound of almonds costs $10 and a pound of walnuts costs $15, we have:

A = $10
W = $15

The first mixture consists of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. The total cost of this mixture can be calculated as:

C1 = (1/2)A + (1/3)W
C1 = (1/2)($10) + (1/3)($15)
C1 = $5 + $5
C1 = $10

The second mixture consists of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. The total cost of this mixture can be calculated as:

C2 = (1/5)A + (1/3)W
C2 = (1/5)($10) + (1/3)($15)
C2 = $2 + $5
C2 = $7

Now, we can find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

ΔC = C1 - C2
ΔC = $10 - $7
ΔC = $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.

We are given two equations:

1) The total number of animal legs is 70: 4S + 2G = 70
2) The total number of animal heads is 20: S + G = 20

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Substituting G = 20 - S into the first equation, we get 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of Roger's purchase, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately and then sum them.

First, let's consider the cost of the coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but it was sold out, so Roger had to buy the more expensive brand. The price increase is 20% of the normal price, which can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Price increase} = 0.20 \times \text{Normal price} = 0.20 \times \$5 = \$1
$$

Therefore, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week. The cost of the more expensive coffee is:

$$
\text{Cost of coffee} = \text{Price per pound} \times \text{Number of pounds} = \$6 \times 7 = \$42
$$

Next, we need to consider the cost of the donut, which is $2.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut:

$$
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of coffee} + \text{Cost of donut} = \$42 + \$2 = \$44
$$

The final answer is: $44"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we can utilize a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus purchased:

Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken: $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00
Adding the cost of the bottle of soda: $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, we can subtract the total cost of the items from the $20.00 Gus spent to find the cost of the apple pie:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The cost of the apple pie is $7.00."
"To determine the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we can utilize a basic arithmetic operation, specifically subtraction, to isolate the unknown quantity.

Let's denote the total number of newspapers delivered as T, the number of newspapers delivered to District A as A, the number of newspapers delivered to District B as B, and the number of newspapers delivered to District C as C. We are given the following values:

T = 600 (total newspapers delivered)
A = 198 (newspapers delivered to District A)
C = 209 (newspapers delivered to District C)

We can express the relationship between these quantities as:

T = A + B + C

Substituting the given values, we get:

600 = 198 + B + 209

To solve for B, we need to isolate B on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting the sum of A and C from both sides:

B = 600 - (198 + 209)

Using the order of operations, we first evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

B = 600 - 407

Now, we can perform the subtraction:

B = 193

Therefore, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

The final answer is: $\boxed{193}$"
"To determine the number of recipes John learns in the cooking class, we need to calculate the total class time and then divide it by the time it takes to learn a new recipe.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total class time per week is 4 × 2 = 8 hours. Since the class lasts for 6 weeks, the total class time is 8 × 6 = 48 hours.

Given that John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, we can calculate the total number of recipes he learns as follows:

Total class time (in hours) = 48
Time to learn a new recipe (in hours) = 1.5

Number of recipes learned = Total class time / Time to learn a new recipe
= 48 / 1.5
= 32

Therefore, John learns 32 new recipes in the cooking class.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the collective sleeping time of the math teachers, we first need to calculate the number of math teachers on the school basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can express this as a proportion:

Number of history teachers = 0.6 * 150
= 90

Since the remaining teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers
= 150 - 90
= 60

Now, we can calculate the collective sleeping time of the math teachers by multiplying the number of math teachers by the hours they sleep per day:

Total time = Number of math teachers * Hours slept per day
= 60 * 6
= 360

Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the amounts of money possessed by Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia. Let's denote the amount of money Aurelia has as A, the amount Kassidy has as K, and the amount Rayna has as R.

We are given that Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, which can be expressed as K = (3/4)A. Additionally, we know that Rayna has 60 dollars more than Kassidy, so R = K + 60.

We are also given that Aurelia has $120. Substituting this value into the equation K = (3/4)A, we get K = (3/4)(120) = 90.

Now, we can substitute the value of K into the equation R = K + 60 to find the amount of money Rayna has: R = 90 + 60 = 150.

To determine the total amount of money the three individuals possess, we can add their individual amounts: A + K + R = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360.

Finally, to find the amount each person would have if they decided to add their money together and share it equally, we divide the total amount by 3: (A + K + R) / 3 = 360 / 3 = 120.

Therefore, each person would have $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the total duration of the basketball game, we must first calculate the length of the regular four quarters and then add the additional time required for the tiebreaker.

The length of each quarter is 12 minutes, and there are four quarters in total. Therefore, the total duration of the regular quarters is 4 × 12 = 48 minutes.

However, the game was extended by 5 minutes due to the tie. To find the total duration of the game, we must add this additional time to the regular quarter duration.

Thus, the total duration of the game is 48 + 5 = 53 minutes.

The final answer is: 53"
"To determine the number of employees who oversee the company, we can break down the problem into manageable steps. Given that 20% of the 50 employees are management, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

This indicates that there are 10 management employees in the company. However, we are further informed that only 30% of these management employees oversee the entire company. To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we can calculate 30% of the management employees:

30% of 10 = 0.30 * 10 = 3

Therefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total amount of dry ingredients required for 16 muffins, we must first calculate the individual amounts of flour, sugar, and salt needed.

The amount of flour required for 16 muffins can be calculated as follows:

Flour = 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 5 * 16 = 80 tablespoons

Similarly, the amount of sugar required is:

Sugar = 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 3 * 16 = 48 tablespoons

The amount of salt required is:

Salt = 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 0.25 * 16 = 4 tablespoons

Now, we can calculate the total amount of dry ingredients needed by summing the individual amounts:

Total dry ingredients = Flour + Sugar + Salt = 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons

Therefore, the total amount of dry ingredients required for 16 muffins is 132 tablespoons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{132}$"
"To determine the equitable distribution of candy among Robert, Cindy, and Aaron, we must first calculate the total amount of candy available for sharing. This can be achieved by summing the individual quantities of candy each possesses.

Let's denote the total amount of candy as $T$. Given that Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds, we can express this as:

$$T = 3 + 5 + 4$$

Simplifying the expression, we obtain:

$$T = 12$$

Now, to find the amount of candy each individual will receive after sharing, we divide the total amount of candy by the number of people, which is 3.

$$\text{Candy per person} = \frac{T}{3} = \frac{12}{3}$$

Simplifying the expression, we find that each person will receive:

$$\text{Candy per person} = 4$$

Therefore, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy after sharing."
"To determine the change Adam received after purchasing the candies, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and subtract this amount from the $15 he paid.

The cost of type A candies can be calculated as follows:

7 candies * $0.5 = $3.50

Similarly, the cost of type B candies is:

10 candies * $0.75 = $7.50

The total cost of the candies is the sum of the costs of type A and type B candies:

Total cost = $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.00

Now, to find the change Adam received, we subtract the total cost from the $15 he paid:

Change = $15.00 - $11.00 = $4.00

Therefore, the change Adam received is $4.00."
"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we can analyze Christina's mood pattern. Given that she had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral, we can infer that the remaining days are neutral. 

The first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the next 8 days were neutral. This accounts for 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 days. Since there are 30 days in total, the remaining days are 30 - 24 = 6.

However, we are also given that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. This means that 2 of the remaining days are good. Therefore, the total number of good days left in the month is 12 (initial good days) - 8 (good days already accounted for) + 2 (remaining good days) = 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of books Sally has, we can establish an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:

Janey's books = 2x + 3

We are given that Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of days required for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches, we first need to establish the current height in inches. Given that the initial height is 20 feet, we can convert this to inches by multiplying by 12, as there are 12 inches in a foot:

20 feet × 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Next, we calculate the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

Δh = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we can use the growth rate of the bamboo, which is 30 inches per day, to determine the number of days required to reach the target height:

t = Δh / growth rate
= 360 inches / 30 inches/day
= 12 days

Therefore, it will take the bamboo 12 days to reach a height of 600 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, indicating a 1:1 ratio of toys to dogs. However, with the arrival of 8 additional dogs, the total number of dogs becomes 4 + 8 = 12. Since each dog requires one toy, James needs 8 additional toys to maintain the 1:1 ratio.

The total number of toys needed so far is 4 (initial toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys.

Upon returning to the shelter, James observes that the number of dogs has doubled, from 8 to 16, resulting in a total of 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (initial additional dogs) + 16 (new dogs) = 28 dogs. Consequently, James requires 28 additional toys to meet the 1:1 ratio.

The total number of toys needed so far is 12 (initial toys) + 28 (additional toys) = 40 toys.

However, upon his final visit, 3 dogs have been removed from the shelter, reducing the total number of dogs to 28 - 3 = 25. Since each dog requires one toy, James no longer needs 3 toys.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 40 (total toys needed so far) - 3 (toys no longer needed) = 37 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{37}$"
"To determine the amount invested by Skyler, we can break down the problem into manageable steps. 

First, let's calculate the amount invested by Dylan. Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount, which is $1200. This can be expressed as:

Dylan's investment = (2/5) * 1200
Dylan's investment = 480

Next, we need to find the remaining amount after Dylan's investment. This can be calculated as:

Remaining amount = Total amount - Dylan's investment
Remaining amount = 1200 - 480
Remaining amount = 720

Now, let's calculate the amount invested by Frances. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 720. This can be expressed as:

Frances' investment = (2/3) * 720
Frances' investment = 480

Finally, we can find the amount invested by Skyler by subtracting Frances' investment from the remaining amount:

Skyler's investment = Remaining amount - Frances' investment
Skyler's investment = 720 - 480
Skyler's investment = 240

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the number of signatures the sisters need to collect to reach their goal, we first calculate the total number of signatures they have collected so far. Let's denote the number of signatures Carol has as C and the number of signatures Jennifer has as J. We are given that C = 20 and J = 44.

The total number of signatures collected so far is the sum of the signatures collected by Carol and Jennifer, which is C + J = 20 + 44 = 64.

The sisters aim to collect a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find the number of signatures they need to collect, we subtract the total number of signatures collected so far from their goal:

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36

Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, we can calculate the number of signatures they need to collect per week to reach their goal by dividing the total number of signatures needed by the number of weeks remaining:

Signatures needed per week = 36 / 3 = 12

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 12 signatures per week for the remaining three weeks to reach their goal of 100 signatures.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine Karen's earnings in two days, we must first establish her hourly wage. Given that Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie's hourly wage is $10, Karen's hourly wage can be calculated as 2 * $10 = $20.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of hours Karen works in two days. Assuming a standard 24-hour day, two days would comprise 2 * 24 = 48 hours. However, since Karen works 3 hours per day, her total hours worked in two days would be 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate Karen's earnings in two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the total hours worked: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can establish a proportion based on the given ratio of potatoes to hash browns. The ratio of 6 potatoes to 36 hash browns can be expressed as a fraction:

6/36 = 1/6

This fraction represents the proportion of potatoes to hash browns. To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion:

(6/36) = (96/x)

where x is the unknown number of hash browns. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

6x = 36 * 96

Expanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get:

6x = 3456

To isolate x, we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

x = 3456 / 6

x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can be used to make 576 hash browns.

The final answer is: $\boxed{576}$"
"To determine the excess weight, we first calculate the total weight of the 9 adults by multiplying the average weight of an adult by the number of adults.

Let's denote the average weight of an adult as $w_a$ and the number of adults as $n$. Given that $w_a = 80$ kg and $n = 9$, we can calculate the total weight as follows:

Total weight = $w_a \cdot n = 80 \text{ kg} \cdot 9 = 720 \text{ kg}$

The maximum load supported by the elevator is 700 kg. To find the excess weight, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = $720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg}$

Therefore, the elevator will exceed the maximum load by 20 kg.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of cookies, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cookies Max has as M, the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as C, and the number of cookies Summer has as S.

We are given the following equations:

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: K = M - 5
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: M = C + 12
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: S = M + 23
4. Katarina has 68 cookies: K = 68

Substituting equation (4) into equation (1), we get:
68 = M - 5
M = 68 + 5
M = 73

Now, we can substitute the value of M into equation (2) to find the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has:
C = M - 12
C = 73 - 12
C = 61

Next, we can substitute the value of M into equation (3) to find the number of cookies Summer has:
S = M + 23
S = 73 + 23
S = 96

Now that we have the number of cookies each person has, we can find the total number of cookies:
Total = K + M + C + S
Total = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
Total = 298

The final answer is: $\boxed{298}$"
"To determine the original length of the dress, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the original length of the dress as 'x'. 

The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, which can be expressed as 0.5x. Additionally, 20cm is added to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the total length of the extended dress is x + 0.5x + 20.

We are given that the final design is 140cm long. This allows us to set up the equation:

x + 0.5x + 20 = 140

Combining like terms, we get:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtracting 20 from both sides yields:

1.5x = 120

Dividing both sides by 1.5 gives us the original length of the dress:

x = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we can approach this problem by considering the time it takes to mow the entire lawn in each mode and then calculate the combined time for both modes.

Let's denote the time it takes to mow the entire lawn in turtle mode as $t_{turtle}$ and in rabbit mode as $t_{rabbit}$. We are given that $t_{turtle} = 60$ minutes and $t_{rabbit} = 40$ minutes.

Since Chris mows half the lawn in each mode, we can express the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode as $\frac{1}{2}t_{turtle}$ and $\frac{1}{2}t_{rabbit}$, respectively.

We can then calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode as follows:

$\frac{1}{2}t_{turtle} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 60 = 30$ minutes
$\frac{1}{2}t_{rabbit} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 40 = 20$ minutes

Now, we can find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn by adding the time it took to mow half the lawn in each mode:

Total time $= \frac{1}{2}t_{turtle} + \frac{1}{2}t_{rabbit} = 30 + 20 = 50$ minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the remaining time for John and Jack to arrive at school without being late, we need to calculate the time elapsed to reach the fire station and subtract it from the total time available.

Given:
- Total time available = 30 minutes
- Time to reach the library = 6 minutes
- Time to reach the fire station from the library = 13 minutes

Time elapsed to reach the fire station = Time to reach the library + Time to reach the fire station from the library
Time elapsed to reach the fire station = 6 minutes + 13 minutes
Time elapsed to reach the fire station = 19 minutes

Remaining time to reach school = Total time available - Time elapsed to reach the fire station
Remaining time to reach school = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Remaining time to reach school = 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes to reach school without being late.

The final answer is: 11"
"To determine the total amount Catherine paid at the grocery store, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the cost of each item: 

- 1 kilo of apples costs $4.
- 2 kilos of bananas cost 2 * $2 = $4.
- 2 kilos of oranges cost 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, we can sum the costs together: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14.

This can also be represented as a mathematical expression: 4 + 4 + 6 = 14.

Therefore, the total amount Catherine paid is $14."
"To determine the number of cookies in the box, we must first calculate the total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda. 

Let's denote the number of cookies baked by Greta as G and the number of cookies baked by Celinda as C. We are given that Greta bakes 30 cookies, so G = 30. We are also given that Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, so C = 2G = 2(30) = 60.

The total number of cookies, T, is the sum of the cookies baked by Greta and Celinda, so T = G + C = 30 + 60 = 90.

When Greta and Celinda eat 10 cookies, the number of cookies remaining in the box, R, is given by R = T - 10 = 90 - 10 = 80.

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Given that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, we can establish two equations based on the provided information:

1. The sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44: T + (T+7) + t = 44
2. The older twin is 7 years older than the triplet: T+7 = t+7

We can simplify the second equation to find the relationship between T and t: T = t

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3t = 37

Divide by 3: t = 37/3

Simplify the fraction: t = 12.33

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, the problem asks for the age of one of the twins, and since we have two twins, we need to find the age of the older twin.

The age of the older twin is T+7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"
"To determine the time available for John to nap, we must first calculate the total time he has before dinner and then subtract the time spent on his homework.

Given that John has 3 hours before dinner, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. This yields:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Next, we need to calculate the total time spent on homework. John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. The total time spent on homework is therefore:

20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes

Now, we can subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to determine the time available for John to nap:

180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes available to nap."
"To determine the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to establish the cost of a single candy. Given that the total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20, and the cost of each lollipop is $0.40, we can calculate the cost of the 5 lollipops as 5 \* $0.40 = $2.00.

Subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost yields the cost of the 4 candies, which is $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. Dividing this by 4 gives the cost of a single candy, $1.20 ÷ 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops, which is 10 \* $0.40 = $4.00. Similarly, the cost of 10 candies is 10 \* $0.30 = $3.00.

Therefore, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Let's denote Rong's monthly savings as $R$ and Neil's monthly savings as $N$. We are given that Rong saves 20 coins per month, so $R = 20$. We are also given that Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so $N = R + \frac{2}{5}R = 20 + \frac{2}{5} \cdot 20 = 20 + 8 = 28$ coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: $R \cdot 12 = 20 \cdot 12 = 240$ coins
Neil's savings per year: $N \cdot 12 = 28 \cdot 12 = 336$ coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: $240 \cdot 10 = 2400$ coins
Neil's total savings: $336 \cdot 10 = 3360$ coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is $2400 + 3360 = 5760$ coins.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5760}$"
"To determine the amount John leaves with after visiting the vet, we need to calculate the total cost of the services provided. The cost of the vaccines is a straightforward $20 each, so the total cost for the two vaccines is 2 \* $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. The heartworm check can be expressed as 0.6x. Therefore, the total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtracting 0.6x from both sides yields 0.4x = $40. Dividing both sides by 0.4 gives x = $100.

Now that we know the total bill is $100, we can calculate the cost of the heartworm check, which is 60% of $100, or 0.6 \* $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, which is $40 + $60 = $100.

Since John brought $125 with him, the amount he leaves with is $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of its constituent parts. 

Let's denote the price of one apple as $a, the price of one banana as $b, and the price of one orange as $o. We are given that a banana costs twice as much as an apple, so b = 2a. We are also given that an orange costs three times as much as a banana, so o = 3b = 3(2a) = 6a.

Given that one crate consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges, we can express the total cost of the crate as:

Total Cost = (5b + 12a + 7o)

Substituting the expressions for b and o in terms of a, we get:

Total Cost = (5(2a) + 12a + 7(6a))
= (10a + 12a + 42a)
= 64a

We are also given that the price of one apple is $0.5. Therefore, a = $0.5.

Substituting this value of a into the expression for the total cost, we get:

Total Cost = 64a
= 64($0.5)
= $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color of squares and then sum them up.

Let's denote the number of red squares as R, blue squares as B, green squares as G, and white squares as W. We are given the following information:

- R = 14
- B = R + 4
- G = B + 6
- W = G - 12

Substituting the given values, we get:
- B = 14 + 4 = 18
- G = 18 + 6 = 24
- W = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we can calculate the total number of squares by summing up the number of squares of each color:
Total squares = R + B + G + W
Total squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12
Total squares = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To determine the number of additional chairs Mia's restaurant needs to accommodate the attendees, we must first calculate the total number of chairs required. Given that there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, the total number of chairs needed is the sum of the two groups.

Total number of chairs needed = Number of adults + Number of babies
= 42 + 15
= 57

Since the restaurant has 8 high chairs, and it is stated that there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

Number of regular chairs = 5 × Number of high chairs
= 5 × 8
= 40

The total number of chairs available is the sum of the high chairs and regular chairs:

Total number of chairs available = Number of high chairs + Number of regular chairs
= 8 + 40
= 48

To find the number of additional chairs needed, we subtract the total number of chairs available from the total number of chairs needed:

Number of chairs needed to be added = Total number of chairs needed - Total number of chairs available
= 57 - 48
= 9

Therefore, Mia's restaurant needs to acquire 9 additional chairs to accommodate the attendees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of 8-point bucks in the field, we first need to calculate the proportion of bucks among the total deer population. Given that 50% of the deer are bucks, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 50 by 100, which yields 0.5. Multiplying this proportion by the total number of deer (50) gives us the number of bucks: 0.5 * 50 = 25.

Next, we need to find the proportion of bucks that are 8 points. Since 20% of the bucks are 8 points, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 20 by 100, which yields 0.2. Multiplying this proportion by the number of bucks (25) gives us the number of 8-point bucks: 0.2 * 25 = 5.

Therefore, the number of 8-point bucks in the field is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total points collected by the class, we need to calculate the points earned by each student. 

Let's start by calculating Betty's points. Since she collected 30% more points than Adam, we can express this as:

Betty's points = Adam's points + (30% of Adam's points)
= 50 + (0.3 * 50)
= 50 + 15
= 65 points

Next, we need to find Tom's points. It is given that Tom has 30 points less than Betty. Therefore, we can express Tom's points as:

Tom's points = Betty's points - 30
= 65 - 30
= 35 points

Now, we are given that Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. Therefore, we can express Martha's points as:

Martha's points = 3 * Tom's points
= 3 * 35
= 105 points

To find the total points collected by the class, we add the points earned by each student:

Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Martha's points
= 50 + 65 + 35 + 105
= 255 points

Since the minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points, we can find the points the class is missing by subtracting the total points collected from the threshold:

Points missing = Threshold - Total points
= 400 - 255
= 145 points

The final answer is: $\boxed{145}$"
"To determine the total number of great grand-babies at the family reunion, we can apply the concept of exponential growth. Given that Great Grandma Jones has 3 children, each of whom has 3 children of their own, and each of these grandchildren has 3 babies, we can express this as a sequence of multiplications.

Let's denote the number of children of Great Grandma Jones as C = 3, the number of children per child as N = 3, and the number of babies per grandchild as B = 3. The total number of great grand-babies can be calculated as follows:

Total great grand-babies = C × N × B
= 3 × 3 × 3
= 3³
= 27

Therefore, the total number of great grand-babies at the family reunion is 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To determine the amount Greta has left to spend after funding her retirement account and making her car payment, we can employ a straightforward calculation based on the principles of percentage allocation.

First, let's calculate the amount Greta allocates to her retirement account. Given that she puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 50 by 100, resulting in 0.5. Multiplying this decimal by her paycheck amount of $2400.00 yields:

0.5 × $2400.00 = $1200.00

Next, we calculate the amount she uses for her car payment, which is 20% of her paycheck. Converting 20% to a decimal by dividing 20 by 100 gives us 0.2. Multiplying this decimal by her paycheck amount of $2400.00 yields:

0.2 × $2400.00 = $480.00

Now, to find the amount Greta has left to spend, we subtract the amounts allocated to her retirement account and car payment from her total paycheck:

$2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00

Therefore, Greta has $720.00 left to spend.

The final answer is: $720.00"
"To determine the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we first need to calculate the number of pencils present in the box. Given that the box has a capacity for 20 pencils and 4 are missing, we can calculate the number of pencils in the box as follows:

Let P represent the number of pencils in the box. We can express this as:

P = Total capacity of the box - Pencils missing
P = 20 - 4
P = 16

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of pencils in the box. Since a pair consists of 2 pencils, we can calculate the number of pairs by dividing the total number of pencils by 2:

Number of pairs of pencils = P / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

Therefore, the number of pairs of pencils in the box is 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we must first calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and her backyard display separately.

The city display consists of 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. Therefore, the total number of fireworks from the city display is given by the product of the number of boxes and the number of fireworks per box:

$$
\text{Total fireworks from city display} = 15 \times 20 = 300
$$

However, Hannah can only see 40% of the city's fireworks. To find the number of fireworks she can see, we need to calculate 40% of 300:

$$
\text{Number of fireworks Hannah can see from city display} = 0.4 \times 300 = 120
$$

Next, we calculate the number of fireworks from Hannah's backyard display. She will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard display is:

$$
\text{Total fireworks from backyard display} = 3 \times 5 = 15
$$

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display:

$$
\text{Total fireworks Hannah will see} = 120 + 15 = 135
$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"To determine the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks purchased and then multiply it by the cost per item.

First, let's calculate the total number of people: Aiden and his 12 friends, plus 7 more friends, equals 19 people.

Since each seat can accommodate one person, two drinks, and three snacks, the total number of drinks and snacks purchased is 19 * 2 (drinks) + 19 * 3 (snacks) = 38 drinks + 57 snacks = 95 items.

The cost per item is $2. Therefore, the total amount spent on snacks and drinks is 95 items * $2 = $190.

The final answer is: $190"
"To determine the capacity of Gary's truck, we can utilize a linear equation to model the given information. Let's denote the capacity of Gary's truck as $x$ pounds. We know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel, and Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which is equivalent to 4,800 pounds.

The total capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

$$4,000 + 4,800 + x = 11,600$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$8,800 + x = 11,600$$

Subtracting 8,800 from both sides of the equation yields:

$$x = 11,600 - 8,800$$

$$x = 2,800$$

Thus, the capacity of Gary's truck is 2,800 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2800}$"
"To determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of dumplings each female ate as $f$ and the number of dumplings each male ate as $m$. We are given that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so we can express this relationship as $m = f + 1$.

We also know that there are 6 females and 8 males, and each female ate 3 dumplings. Therefore, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is $6f = 6 \times 3 = 18$. Since each male ate 4 dumplings (as $m = f + 1$ and $f = 3$), the total number of dumplings eaten by males is $8m = 8 \times 4 = 32$.

The total number of dumplings eaten by all individuals is the sum of the dumplings eaten by females and males, which is $6f + 8m = 18 + 32 = 50$. Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"Given that Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2, we can determine the initial amounts allocated to each individual using the concept of proportional division. The total parts in the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5.

To find Gerald's initial amount, we can use the formula:

Gerald's initial amount = (3/5) × Total amount
= (3/5) × 100
= 60

Since Gerald spent $10 on a book, we can calculate his remaining amount by subtracting the expenditure from his initial amount:

Gerald's remaining amount = Initial amount - Expenditure
= 60 - 10
= 50

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left after spending $10 on a book.

The final answer is: $50"
"Given that Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, and the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet/second, we can determine the speed of the turtle by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

Let's denote the speed of the turtle as $v_t$. We know that the cat's speed is 5 times the turtle's speed, so we can express this relationship as:

$v_c = 5v_t$

where $v_c$ is the speed of the cat. We are given that $v_c = 15$ feet/second. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

$15 = 5v_t$

To solve for $v_t$, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

$v_t = \frac{15}{5}$
$v_t = 3$ feet/second

Now that we have the speed of the turtle, we can calculate the distance it can crawl in 40 seconds. The distance traveled is given by the product of the speed and time:

$d = v_t \times t$
$d = 3 \times 40$
$d = 120$ feet

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we can employ a straightforward approach based on linear algebra. 

Let's denote the total amount raised as $A, the number of hours they need to fundraise as $h$, and the amount raised per hour as $r$. We know that the total amount raised is the product of the number of hours and the amount raised per hour, i.e., $A = hr$. 

Given that the firefighters have already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, we can calculate the amount raised per hour as $r = \frac{A_1}{h_1} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700$, where $A_1$ and $h_1$ are the amount raised and the number of hours, respectively.

The total goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. Therefore, the remaining amount to be raised is $A - A_1 = 6300 - 2100 = 4200$. 

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we can use the same formula $A = hr$. Since we know the amount raised per hour ($r = 700) and the remaining amount to be raised ($A - A_1 = 4200), we can solve for $h$: $h = \frac{A - A_1}{r} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6$.

However, this is the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount. Since they have already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours: $h_{total} = h + h_1 = 6 + 3 = 9$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we must first calculate the percentage of water used by the city and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

Given that Colorado City utilizes 40% of the water from the Colorado River, we can express this as a decimal: 0.4. 

Next, we are informed that 80% of the water used by the city is utilized for industrial purposes. To find the percentage used for industrial purposes, we multiply the percentage of water used by the city by the percentage used for industrial purposes: 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

To find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 0.4 - 0.32 = 0.08 or 8%.

Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we must first calculate the total number of days in the given period. Since there are 7 days in a standard week, we can calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks as follows:

2 weeks = 7 days/week * 2 weeks
= 14 days

Given that Alex charges $12 per day, we can calculate the total amount she charges for 2 weeks of tutoring by multiplying the number of days by the daily charge:

Total amount = 14 days * $12/day
= $168

Therefore, the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring is $168.

The final answer is: $168"
"To determine the total quarts of ice cream produced in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rates of chocolate and vanilla ice cream separately and then sum them.

The production rate of chocolate ice cream can be calculated as follows:

Let's denote the production rate of chocolate ice cream as $r_{choc}$. We know that 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream are produced in 2 hours. Therefore, the production rate of chocolate ice cream is given by:

$$r_{choc} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ quarts/hour}.$$

Similarly, the production rate of vanilla ice cream can be calculated as follows:

Let's denote the production rate of vanilla ice cream as $r_{van}$. We know that 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream are produced in 4 hours. Therefore, the production rate of vanilla ice cream is given by:

$$r_{van} = \frac{50}{4} = 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour}.$$

Now, we can calculate the total quarts of ice cream produced in 48 hours by summing the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream produced in that time period:

$$\text{Total quarts} = r_{choc} \times 48 + r_{van} \times 48 = 50 \times 48 + 12.5 \times 48 = 2400 + 600 = 3000.$$

Therefore, the total quarts of ice cream produced in 48 hours is 3000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To determine Marcus' total bill, we must first calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

The cost of the croissants can be calculated as follows: 5 * $3.00 = $15.00. This is a straightforward application of the distributive property of multiplication over addition.

Similarly, the cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00, which is another instance of the distributive property.

The cost of the mini quiches is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00, and the cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

To find the total cost before the discount, we sum these values: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

The discount is 10% of the total cost, which can be calculated as 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00.

Therefore, the total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should purchase, we can analyze the given deal as a mathematical problem. The ice cream parlor offers a ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 free"" deal, where each scoop costs $1.50. 

Let's denote the number of scoops Erin can buy as 'n'. Since the deal is based on a ratio of 2:1, we can express the total number of scoops Erin can get as 3n/2. However, this is not a direct representation of the number of scoops she can buy, as the deal is based on a 2-for-1 ratio.

To take advantage of the deal, Erin should buy 2 scoops and get 1 free, which is a total of 3 scoops for the price of 2. The remaining amount of money Erin has, $6.00 - 3 * $1.50 = $0.00, is not sufficient to buy another scoop. 

However, we can also consider the scenario where Erin buys 2 scoops and uses the remaining money to buy an additional scoop. In this case, the total number of scoops she can buy is 3.

Therefore, the optimal number of scoops Erin should buy is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of candies Amy and Ginger have after two weeks, we need to calculate their daily candy consumption and then subtract the total candies eaten from their initial amount.

Let's denote the initial number of candies as $I$, the daily candy consumption for Ginger as $G_d$, and the daily candy consumption for Amy as $A_d$. The time period is two weeks, which is equivalent to 14 days.

Given that Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, we have $G_d = 4$. Similarly, Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so $A_d = 3$.

The total number of candies eaten by Ginger in two weeks is $G_d \times 14 = 4 \times 14 = 56$. The total number of candies eaten by Amy in two weeks is $A_d \times 14 = 3 \times 14 = 42$.

The initial number of candies for both Ginger and Amy is $I = 100$. After two weeks, Ginger has $I - G_d \times 14 = 100 - 56 = 44$ candies left. Similarly, Amy has $I - A_d \times 14 = 100 - 42 = 58$ candies left.

To find the difference in the number of candies Amy and Ginger have after two weeks, we subtract Ginger's remaining candies from Amy's remaining candies: $58 - 44 = 14$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of mosaic tiles required to cover two thirds of Mr. Boarden's 36 sq ft bathroom, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach.

First, we need to calculate two thirds of the total area. This can be achieved by multiplying the total area by the fraction 2/3. Mathematically, this is represented as:

(2/3) * 36 = (2 * 36) / 3

Using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can simplify this expression as:

(2 * 36) / 3 = 72 / 3

Now, we can perform the division to obtain the result:

72 / 3 = 24

Therefore, Mr. Boarden needs to cover an area of 24 sq ft.

Given that he requires 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we can calculate the total number of tiles needed by multiplying the area by the number of tiles per square foot:

24 * 24 = 576

Hence, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

The final answer is: $\boxed{576}$"
"To determine the amount James saved by picking blueberries, we must first calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries and then compare it to the cost of purchasing them at the store.

The cost of picking blueberries can be calculated as the sum of the initial cost and the cost per pound multiplied by the number of pounds picked. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

C_{picking} = C_{initial} + (C_{per\,pound} \times P_{pounds})

where C_{picking} is the total cost of picking, C_{initial} is the initial cost, C_{per\,pound} is the cost per pound, and P_{pounds} is the number of pounds picked.

Given that the initial cost is $20, the cost per pound is $1.5, and the number of pounds picked is 30, we can substitute these values into the equation:

C_{picking} = $20 + ($1.5 \times 30)
C_{picking} = $20 + $45
C_{picking} = $65

Next, we calculate the cost of purchasing the blueberries at the store, which is given by the cost per pound multiplied by the number of pounds:

C_{store} = C_{per\,pound} \times P_{pounds}
C_{store} = $2.5 \times 30
C_{store} = $75

To find the amount James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of purchasing at the store:

Savings = C_{store} - C_{picking}
Savings = $75 - $65
Savings = $10

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

The final answer is: $10"
"To determine the total amount of money the company paid for the computers, we need to calculate the new price of each computer after the 10% price increase.

Let's denote the original price of each computer as $P. Given that the price increase is 10%, we can express the new price as P + 0.1P = 1.1P.

The original price of each computer is $700, so the new price is 1.1 * 700 = $770.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid for 500 computers by multiplying the new price by the number of computers:

Total Amount = New Price * Number of Computers
= 770 * 500
= $385,000

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."
"To determine the total caloric content of the omelet, we must first calculate the caloric contributions from each component. 

The omelet consists of 6 eggs, each with a caloric content of 75 calories. Therefore, the total caloric contribution from the eggs is 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories.

The omelet also contains 2 oz of cheese, with a caloric content of 120 calories per ounce. Consequently, the total caloric contribution from the cheese is 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories.

Lastly, the omelet contains 2 oz of ham, with a caloric content of 40 calories per ounce. Hence, the total caloric contribution from the ham is 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories.

To obtain the total caloric content of the omelet, we sum the caloric contributions from each component: 450 calories (eggs) + 240 calories (cheese) + 80 calories (ham) = 770 calories.

The final answer is: $\boxed{770}$"
"To determine the change received after purchasing 6 pencils and 8 erasers, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the pencils and erasers. The cost of pencils is given by the product of the number of pencils and the cost per pencil: 6 * $0.50 = $3. Similarly, the cost of erasers is given by the product of the number of erasers and the cost per eraser: 8 * $0.25 = $2.

The total cost of the items is the sum of the cost of pencils and erasers: $3 + $2 = $5.

Given that the total amount paid is $10, the change received can be calculated as the difference between the amount paid and the total cost: $10 - $5 = $5.

Therefore, the change received is $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"To determine the number of individuals who accept the position, we can apply a series of conditional probabilities. Given that 100 people apply for the job at Google, we first identify the proportion of applicants who receive interviews, which is 30% or 0.3.

Let's denote the number of applicants as $N = 100$. The number of individuals who receive interviews is then $N_{interviews} = 0.3N = 0.3 \times 100 = 30$.

Next, we calculate the proportion of those who receive interviews and are subsequently offered a job, which is 20% or 0.2. Therefore, the number of individuals who receive a job offer is $N_{offer} = 0.2 \times N_{interviews} = 0.2 \times 30 = 6$.

Finally, we determine the proportion of those who receive a job offer and accept the position, which is one-third or $\frac{1}{3}$. Hence, the number of individuals who accept the position is $N_{accept} = \frac{1}{3} \times N_{offer} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total amount of rice given to Goldy's cousin and brother, we need to calculate the total number of sacks given away and then multiply it by the weight of each sack.

Let's denote the number of sacks given to the cousin as C and the number of sacks given to the brother as B. We are given that C = 3 and B = 4. The total number of sacks given away is the sum of C and B.

Total sacks given away = C + B = 3 + 4 = 7 sacks

Since each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice, we can calculate the total weight of rice given away by multiplying the total number of sacks by the weight of each sack.

Total kilograms given away = (C + B) * 25 kg/sack = 7 * 25 kg/sack = 175 kg

Therefore, Goldy gave a total of 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother.

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of cereal boxes purchased between this week and last week, we need to calculate the total number of boxes acquired in each time period. 

This week, Castle purchased 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, resulting in a total of 3 + 5 = 8 boxes.

Last week, she acquired 4 boxes of cereal.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of boxes purchased last week from the number of boxes purchased this week: 8 - 4 = 4.

Therefore, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week.

"To determine the total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of taps for both scenarios (with arms down and with arms up) and add them together.

Let's denote the number of taps per minute for each foot as follows:
- Right foot taps per minute (R) = 300
- Left foot taps per minute (L) = 250

Scenario 1: Arms down
The total number of taps per minute is the sum of the taps per minute for each foot: R + L = 300 + 250 = 550.
The total number of taps for 3 minutes is the product of the total taps per minute and the number of minutes: 550 * 3 = 1650.

Scenario 2: Arms up
The total number of taps per minute is the sum of the taps per minute for each foot: R' + L' = 200 + 200 = 400.
The total number of taps for 2 minutes is the product of the total taps per minute and the number of minutes: 400 * 2 = 800.

The total number of taps is the sum of the total number of taps for both scenarios: 1650 + 800 = 2450.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we must first calculate the total cost of repairing the pothole and then subtract it from the potential damage to his vehicle.

The potential damage to Ron's vehicle is $450. 

The cost of repairing the pothole consists of two components: the fine for unauthorized road maintenance, which is $120, and the cost of the asphalt, which is 3 buckets at $25 per bucket. Therefore, the total cost of the asphalt is 3 × $25 = $75.

The total cost of repairing the pothole is the sum of the fine and the cost of the asphalt: $120 + $75 = $195.

Now, we can calculate the amount of money Ron saves by subtracting the total cost of repairing the pothole from the potential damage to his vehicle: $450 - $195 = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

The final answer is: $255"
"To determine the total number of chairs remaining in the restaurant, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of chairs initially available. The restaurant has 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs, giving us a total of:

Total chairs = Normal chairs + Baby chairs
Total chairs = 170 + 23
Total chairs = 193

Next, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair. We know that 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs were sent for repair, so the total number of chairs sent for repair is:

Total chairs sent for repair = Normal chairs sent + Baby chairs sent
Total chairs sent for repair = 20 + 13
Total chairs sent for repair = 33

Now, we can calculate the total number of chairs remaining by subtracting the number of chairs sent for repair from the initial total:

Total chairs remaining = Total chairs - Total chairs sent for repair
Total chairs remaining = 193 - 33
Total chairs remaining = 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into manageable parts. Let's start by determining the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two of his friends. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can express this as a fraction of the total number of slices.

Let's denote the total number of slices as S. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is a multiple of 12. We can express the number of slices eaten by Bryce and two of his friends as (2/3) * (5 * 12), where 5 represents the number of people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas.

(2/3) * (5 * 12) = (2/3) * 60 = 40 slices

However, this is the total number of slices eaten by 5 people, but we know that 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:

(2/3) * (3 * 12) = (2/3) * 36 = 24 slices

Now, we subtract the number of slices eaten by 3 people from the total number of slices eaten by 5 people to find the number of slices eaten by the remaining 2 people:

40 slices - 24 slices = 16 slices

Now, we know that 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is:

2 * 9 slices = 18 slices

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people:

24 slices + 16 slices + 18 slices = 58 slices

The total number of slices is a multiple of 12, so we can express it as 60 slices (5 * 12). Now, we can find the number of slices left:

60 slices - 58 slices = 2 slices

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to consume the sausages, we first need to establish the time taken by the dog to eat the same number of sausages as the cat.

Given that the cat consumes 9 sausages in 30 minutes, we can calculate the dog's time by multiplying the cat's time by 2/3, as the dog takes 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes.

Let's denote the time taken by the cat as $t_c = 30$ minutes and the time taken by the dog as $t_d$. We can express the relationship between the two times as:

$$t_d = \frac{2}{3}t_c$$

Substituting the value of $t_c$, we get:

$$t_d = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes}$$

Now, to find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog, we can use the formula for the average of two values:

$$\text{Average time} = \frac{t_c + t_d}{2}$$

Substituting the values of $t_c$ and $t_d$, we get:

$$\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}$$

Therefore, the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to consume the sausages is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Given that 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can express the length of Topher's shoe as 8 * 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This relationship can be expressed as:

x * 9 + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation yields:

x * 9 = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us:

x = 90 / 9
x = 10

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars. Given that there are 64 students' cars with four windows each, and a quarter of the windows are smashed, we can calculate the total number of windows smashed from students' cars as follows:

Total windows smashed from students' cars = (1/4) × (64 × 4) = (1/4) × 256 = 64

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with two windows each, and three-fourths of the windows are smashed. We can calculate the total number of windows smashed from teachers' cars as follows:

Total windows smashed from teachers' cars = (3/4) × (32 × 2) = (3/4) × 64 = 48

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars to find the overall total:

Total windows smashed = 64 + 48 = 112

The final answer is: $\boxed{112}$"
"To determine the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we need to calculate the proportion of blue spools to the total number of spools. 

First, we identify the total number of blue spools by summing the light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we calculate the total number of spools by summing all the spools of different colors.

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue is 40%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the number of people who voted by midday. Given that 2/5 of the 5000 people had voted by midday, we can express this as:

$$\frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000$$

This means that 2000 people had voted by midday.

Next, we need to find the number of people who voted by 16:00. Since 2/3 of the remaining people had voted by 16:00, we first calculate the number of people remaining after midday:

$$5000 - 2000 = 3000$$

Then, we calculate 2/3 of the remaining people:

$$\frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000$$

Therefore, 2000 more people voted by 16:00.

To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we subtract the total number of people who voted (2000 by midday and 2000 by 16:00) from the total number of people:

$$5000 - (2000 + 2000) = 5000 - 4000 = 1000$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we must first calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will consume during this period. Given that Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day, the total number of pieces he will consume in 30 days can be calculated as follows:

Total number of pieces = 4 pieces/day * 30 days = 4 * 30 = 120 pieces

Next, we need to determine the number of packs required to meet this demand. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, we can calculate the number of packs needed by dividing the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:

Number of packs = Total number of pieces / Number of pieces per pack = 120 / 15

To perform this division, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 15:

Number of packs = (120 / 15) = (4 * 30) / 15 = 4 * (30 / 15) = 4 * 2 = 8

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers required, we need to calculate the total number of smores needed and then divide that by the number of smores each box can produce.

First, let's calculate the total number of smores required. We have 9 kids who want 2 smores each, so the total number of smores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18. Additionally, 6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of smores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6. Therefore, the total number of smores required is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, we can calculate the total number of sleeves needed as follows: 24 smores / 8 smores per sleeve = 3 sleeves. Given that there are 3 sleeves in a box, we can determine the total number of boxes needed by dividing the total number of sleeves required by the number of sleeves per box: 3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

Therefore, the number of boxes of graham crackers required is 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"Given the problem statement, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between Dora's age, her father's age, and her mother's age.

Let D = Dora's age, F = Dora's father's age, and M = Dora's mother's age.

We are given that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, which can be represented as F = 2D + 8.

Additionally, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, which can be represented as M = F - 4.

We are also given that Dora is 15 years old, so D = 15.

Substituting D = 15 into the first equation, we get F = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38.

Now, we can substitute F = 38 into the second equation to find M: M = 38 - 4 = 34.

To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can add their individual ages: D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87.

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87 years.

The final answer is: 87"
"To determine the equitable distribution of the $20 among Greg's 3 younger siblings, we can apply the concept of division in mathematics. Specifically, we will utilize the operation of division to allocate the total amount of money fairly among the siblings.

The mathematical operation to find the amount each sibling receives is given by:

Amount per sibling = Total amount / Number of siblings

Substituting the given values, we have:

Amount per sibling = $20 / 3

To perform this division, we can use long division or a calculator. Using a calculator, we get:

Amount per sibling = $20 / 3 = $6.67

Therefore, each of Greg's siblings will receive $6.67."
"To determine the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we can apply a straightforward arithmetic approach. Given that her math and science books weigh 2 pounds each, we can calculate their combined weight as 2 x 2 = 4 pounds.

The French book weighs 4 pounds, and the English book weighs 3 pounds. Furthermore, the history book weighs twice as much as the English book, which is 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, we can sum the weights of all the books: 4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we can start by calculating the number of votes candidate B received. Given that candidate A obtained 20% of the votes, we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{20}{100}$ or simply 0.2. Multiplying this fraction by the total number of voters (100) yields the number of votes candidate A received: $0.2 \times 100 = 20$ votes.

Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. To calculate this, we can express 50% as a decimal: 0.5. We then add this to the number of votes candidate A received: $20 + (0.5 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30$ votes.

The total number of votes is 100. Candidate A and B combined received 20 + 30 = 50 votes. Therefore, candidate C received the remaining votes, which is $100 - 50 = 50$ votes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step. We are given that Boris has an initial amount of apples, denoted as $B$, which is equal to 100. We are also given that Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck's initial amount of apples can be expressed as $B - 23$. 

Given that Boris gives Beck 10 apples, we can express Beck's new amount of apples as $(B - 23) + 10$. 

We are asked to find the difference between Boris's new amount of apples and Beck's new amount of apples. To do this, we first need to find Boris's new amount of apples, which is $B - 10$. 

Now, we can express the difference between Boris's new amount of apples and Beck's new amount of apples as $(B - 10) - [(B - 23) + 10]$. 

Simplifying this expression, we get $(B - 10) - (B - 13) = B - 10 - B + 13 = 3$.

Therefore, the difference between Boris's new amount of apples and Beck's new amount of apples is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the amount of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial amount of water.

Let's denote the number of giant cubes as $g$, medium cubes as $m$, and small cubes as $s$. We are given that $g = 3$, $m = 7$, and $s = 8$. The amount of water used for each type of cube is as follows:

- Giant cubes: $4g = 4(3) = 12$ ounces
- Medium cubes: $2m = 2(7) = 14$ ounces
- Small cubes: $0.5s = 0.5(8) = 4$ ounces

The total amount of water used is the sum of the water used for each type of cube: $12 + 14 + 4 = 30$ ounces.

Now, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water: $32 - 30 = 2$ ounces.

Therefore, Peter has 2 ounces of water left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a relationship between the number of books each individual possesses. Let's denote the number of books Steven has as S, the number of books Alice has as A, and the number of books Clara has as C.

From the information provided, we know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven, which can be expressed as C = 2S. We are also given that Clara has 20 books, so we can solve for S:

C = 2S
20 = 2S
S = 20 / 2
S = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can determine the number of books Alice has. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can express this as A = S + 6. Substituting the value of S, we get:

A = 10 + 6
A = 16

To find the difference in the number of books between Clara and Alice, we can subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

C - A = 20 - 16
C - A = 4

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and a half-gallon jar costs $2 less, we can express the cost of a half-gallon jar as $5 - $2 = $3. 

To determine the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars, we can calculate the total cost of each type of jar separately and then sum the results.

The total cost of 10-gallon jars is given by the product of the number of gallon jars and the cost per gallon jar: 10 \* $5 = $50.

Similarly, the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars is given by the product of the number of half-gallon jars and the cost per half-gallon jar: 16 \* $3 = $48.

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is the sum of the total cost of the gallon jars and the total cost of the half-gallon jars: $50 + $48 = $98.

The final answer is: $98"
"Given a class of 50 students with diverse hobbies, we can apply set theory to determine the number of students who prefer playing video games. Let's denote the sets as follows:

- B = {students who like to bake}
- G = {students who like to play video games}
- M = {students who like to play music}
- Bb = {students who like to play basketball}

We are given that |B| = 10, |Bb| = 5, and |M| = 2|Bb| = 10.

The total number of students who like to either play video games or music is the union of sets G and M, which can be expressed as |G ∪ M| = |G| + |M| - |G ∩ M|. However, since we do not have information about the intersection of G and M, we will assume that the intersection is empty for the sake of this problem, which is a reasonable assumption given the context.

We can now express the total number of students who like to either play video games or music as |G ∪ M| = |G| + |M| = |G| + 10.

We also know that the total number of students is 50, and the number of students who like to bake or play basketball is 10 + 5 = 15. Therefore, the number of students who like to either play video games or music is 50 - 15 = 35.

Now, we can solve for |G| by setting up the equation |G| + 10 = 35, which yields |G| = 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the number of birds that were scared away, we can calculate 1/3 of the initial number of birds, which is 12.

$$\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = \frac{12}{3} = 4$$

So, 4 birds were scared away. 

Now, we subtract 4 from the initial number of birds: 
$$12 - 4 = 8$$

Then, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. 
$$8 + 20 = 28$$

Therefore, the final number of birds in the backyard is 28."
"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information. Let's denote the number of students in each class as x. Since there are two classes with the same number of students, the total number of students is 2x, which is given as 80. Therefore, we can write the equation:

2x = 80

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

Now that we know the number of students in each class is 40, we can calculate the number of girls in each class. Given that 40% of the students are girls, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 40 by 100 and multiplying by 40:

Number of girls = (40/100) * 40
= 0.4 * 40
= 16

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls
= 40 - 16
= 24

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of cake slices remaining on the plate, we can apply a step-by-step approach, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and logical reasoning.

Initially, Mara had 2 slices on the plate. She then added 3 slices, resulting in a total of 2 + 3 = 5 slices.

Subsequently, she tripled the number of slices, which can be represented as 5 × 3 = 15 slices.

Following this, Mara consumed 2 slices, leaving her with 15 - 2 = 13 slices.

Lastly, her friend stole 5 slices, reducing the total to 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

Therefore, the number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8.

"To determine the number of animals Melissa will groom each day, we must first calculate the total number of animals that require grooming and then divide this total by the number of days in a week.

The total number of animals can be calculated by summing the number of dogs, cats, birds, and horses that need to be groomed.

Total number of dogs = 8
Total number of cats = 5
Total number of birds = 3
Total number of horses = 12

Total number of animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the number of animals Melissa will groom each day by dividing the total number of animals by 7.

Number of animals per day = Total number of animals / Number of days in a week
= 28 / 7
= 4

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the profit made by Mark, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue from the sale of the cards.

The total cost is the cost of the packs, which is a straightforward calculation: 3 packs * $1800 = $5400.

The total revenue, however, requires a more nuanced approach. We have three distinct categories of cards: one card worth $4000, one card worth $1000, and 30 cards worth an average of $50 each. To calculate the total revenue, we sum the values of these cards: $4000 + $1000 + (30 * $50) = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

Therefore, the profit made by Mark is $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"To determine the cost savings of choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference between them.

Let's denote the number of adults as A and the number of children as C. In this case, A = 2 and C = 2.

The cost function for the first amusement park can be represented as:
C1 = 26A + 12C
C1 = 26(2) + 12(2)
C1 = 52 + 24
C1 = 76

The cost function for the second amusement park can be represented as:
C2 = 14A + 10C
C2 = 14(2) + 10(2)
C2 = 28 + 20
C2 = 48

Now, we can find the difference in cost between the two amusement parks:
ΔC = C1 - C2
ΔC = 76 - 48
ΔC = 28

Therefore, the family will be able to save $28 by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

The final answer is: $28"
"To determine the weekly savings of the tomato vendor, we can calculate the daily savings and then multiply it by 7.

Let's denote the original price per tomato as $0.5 and the new price per tomato as $0.4. The daily savings can be calculated as follows:

Daily savings = (500 * 0.5) - (500 * 0.4)
Daily savings = 250 - 200
Daily savings = 50

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7:

Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7
Weekly savings = 50 * 7
Weekly savings = 350

Therefore, the tomato vendor saves $350 per week by switching to the new vendor.

The final answer is: $350"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a mathematical relationship between the number of marbles each individual possesses. Let's denote the number of marbles Sean has as S, the number of marbles Carl has as C, and the number of marbles Cal has as Ca.

We are given that Sean has 56 marbles, so S = 56. We also know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, which can be expressed as S = Ca/2. Substituting the value of S, we get 56 = Ca/2, and solving for Ca yields Ca = 112.

Furthermore, we are told that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, which can be written as C = 4S. Substituting the value of S, we get C = 4(56) = 224.

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together: C + Ca = 224 + 112 = 336.

The final answer is: $\boxed{336}$"
"To determine the number of additional groups required to form 12 groups, we first need to calculate the total number of students per group. Given that 54 students are to be separated into six groups of equal size, we can calculate the number of students per group as follows:

Students per group = Total students / Number of groups
Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

Now, we are informed that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students required, we multiply the number of groups by the students per group:

Total students required = Number of groups * Students per group
Total students required = 12 * 9
Total students required = 108

Since we already have 54 students, we need to find the number of additional students required to form 12 groups:

Additional students required = Total students required - Total students available
Additional students required = 108 - 54
Additional students required = 54

To determine the number of additional groups required, we divide the additional students required by the students per group:

Additional groups required = Additional students required / Students per group
Additional groups required = 54 / 9
Additional groups required = 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total number of chairs rented by Candy in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the average daily chair rentals and then multiply it by the total number of days in two months.

First, let's calculate the average daily chair rentals. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week. 

- Weekday rentals: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekend rentals: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total weekly rentals: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs
- Average daily rentals: 500 chairs/week / 7 days/week = 500/7 ≈ 71.43 chairs/day

Now, let's calculate the total number of days in two 4-week months. Since a month is approximately 4 weeks, two months would be approximately 8 weeks. However, to account for the varying number of days in a month, we'll use the exact number of days in two months. 

- February has 28 days, and the other months have 30 days. So, two months would have (28 + 30 + 28 + 30) = 116 days.

Now, we can calculate the total number of chairs rented in two months:
- Total chairs rented in two months: 71.43 chairs/day * 116 days ≈ 8291.88 chairs

The final answer is: 8292"
"To determine the number of bananas Gunther had at the end, we can break down the sequence of events.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

When Arnold stole half of the bananas, the number of bananas left is 48 - (48/2) = 48 - 24 = 24.

Gunther then added 25 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 24 + 25 = 49.

Subsequently, Arnold stole 12 bananas, leaving 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

Finally, Gunther added 6 bananas, resulting in a total of 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, the final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43."
"To determine the annual electricity cost per roommate, we can employ a straightforward division of the total monthly electricity bill by the number of roommates, followed by a multiplication by the number of months in a year.

Given that the monthly electricity bill is $100 and there are 4 roommates, we can calculate the monthly cost per roommate as follows:

$100 ÷ 4 = $25 per roommate per month

To find the annual cost per roommate, we multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year:

$25 per month × 12 months per year = $300 per year

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to calculate the total number of items sent and then subtract the number of broken items.

First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates sent. Since a dozen is equal to 12, we can express this as:

Total glasses = 8 × 12 = 96
Total plates = 4 × 12 = 48

Now, let's subtract the number of broken items:
Broken glasses = 10
Broken plates = 6

Glasses left = Total glasses - Broken glasses = 96 - 10 = 86
Plates left = Total plates - Broken plates = 48 - 6 = 42

Therefore, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of small buttons Lorraine has as $S$ and the number of large buttons as $L$. Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. We can express the initial number of small buttons as $S_0 = 0$ and the initial number of large buttons as $L_0 = 0$.

First, Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. The number of small stickers she trades is $0.9 \times 30 = 27$. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers. Therefore, the new number of small buttons is $S = S_0 + 27 = 0 + 27 = 27$.

Next, Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. The number of large stickers she trades is $0.5 \times 40 = 20$. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers. Therefore, the new number of large buttons is $L = L_0 + 20 = 0 + 20 = 20$.

Now, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left. She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets $20 \times 3 = 60$ small buttons from trading large stickers.

The total number of buttons Lorraine has is the sum of the small buttons and large buttons, which is $S + L = 27 + 20 + 60 = 107$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{107}$"
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we can utilize a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

Let's break down the information provided: Joey played 2 matches on Monday and 1 match on Friday. On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, we can calculate the total number of matches by summing the matches played on each day: 
2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since there are twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is 33. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combining like terms, we get:

3x = 33

Dividing both sides by 3 yields:

x = 11

Since x represents the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x:

2x = 2(11)
= 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total number of shirts ordered, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of students needing each size as follows: x (extra-small), y (small), z (medium), w (large), and v (extra-large).

From the problem statement, we have the following relationships:

1. x = 11 (given)
2. y = 2x = 2(11) = 22
3. z = y - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18
4. w = z / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
5. v = w + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, we can calculate the total number of shirts ordered by summing the number of students for each size:

Total shirts = x + y + z + w + v
= 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15
= 75

Therefore, the total number of shirts ordered is 75."
"To determine the final price after a 5% discount on an item marked at $140, we can apply the formula for calculating the discounted price:

Discounted price = Original price - (Original price * Discount rate)

Given that the discount rate is 5% or 0.05, we can substitute the values into the formula:

Discounted price = $140 - ($140 * 0.05)

First, calculate the discount amount:

$140 * 0.05 = $7

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

Discounted price = $140 - $7
Discounted price = $133

Therefore, the final price after the discount is $133."
"To determine the total duration of the 20 playlists, we can employ a straightforward approach by leveraging the principles of arithmetic operations. Specifically, we will utilize the concept of multiplication to calculate the total number of hours.

Let's denote the number of songs in each playlist as S, the number of playlists as P, and the duration of each song in hours as D. We are given the following values:

S = 300 songs/playlist
P = 20 playlists
D = 10 hours/song

To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we can multiply the number of songs in each playlist by the number of playlists and then multiply the result by the duration of each song in hours. This can be expressed as:

Total hours = S × P × D
= 300 songs/playlist × 20 playlists × 10 hours/song
= 300 × 20 × 10

Therefore, the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is 60000."
"To determine the number of people who think horse #12 will win the big race, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win. This is given as 20% of the total number of people, which is 50. We can express this as a mathematical operation:

20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

Next, we need to find the number of people who think horse #7 will win. This is 60% of the remaining people, which is 50 - 10 = 40 people. We can express this as:

60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

Now, we can find the number of people who think horse #12 will win by subtracting the number of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total number of people:

Number of people who think horse #12 will win = Total number of people - (Number of people who think horse #2 will win + Number of people who think horse #7 will win)
= 50 - (10 + 24)
= 50 - 34
= 16 people.

Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Given the problem, we can approach it by first identifying the proportion of Pomeranian puppies and then determining the total number of puppies.

Let's denote the total number of puppies as P. We are given that two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, which can be expressed as:

(2/3)P = Number of Pomeranians

We are also given that one-third of the Pomeranians are girls, and this number is equal to 6. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

(1/3) * (2/3)P = 6

To solve for P, we can simplify the left-hand side of the equation by multiplying the fractions:

(2/9)P = 6

Next, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 9/2 to isolate P:

P = 6 * (9/2)
P = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies.

The final answer is: 27"
"To determine the amount Jayden needs to purchase the camera, we must first calculate the total amount of money he has after receiving the allowance from his sister. 

Jayden's initial capital is $70. His sister, Ava, contributes half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. Therefore, Jayden's total capital becomes $70 + $45 = $115.

The cost of the camera is $200. To find the amount Jayden needs to purchase the camera, we subtract his total capital from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

Thus, Jayden requires an additional $85 to purchase the camera.

The final answer is: $85"
"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the first house needs as x, the second house as y, and the third house as z.

We are given that the first house needs 1/2 of the second, so we can express this as x = (1/2)y.

We are also given that the third house needs double the first, so we can express this as z = 2x.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250, so we can write the equation: x + y + z = 250.

Substituting the expressions for x and z into the equation, we get (1/2)y + y + 2((1/2)y) = 250.

Simplifying the equation, we get (1/2)y + y + y = 250.

Combining like terms, we get (5/2)y = 250.

Multiplying both sides by 2/5, we get y = 100.

Now that we have the value of y, we can find the value of x: x = (1/2)y = (1/2)(100) = 50.

Finally, we can find the value of z: z = 2x = 2(50) = 100.

Therefore, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the total expenditure for the salad, we must calculate the individual costs and then sum them. 

First, we calculate the cost of the cucumbers. Leila purchases 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so her total expenditure is 3 × $2 = $6.

Next, we calculate the cost of the tomatoes. Jack purchases 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so his total expenditure is 5 × $1 = $5.

Lastly, we calculate the cost of the lettuce. Chase purchases 1 head of lettuce at $3, so his total expenditure is $3.

Now, we sum the individual expenditures to find the total cost: $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"Given that George has 45% more pears than bananas, and he possesses 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Let's denote the number of bananas as B and the number of pears as P. We are given that P = B + 0.45B, which simplifies to P = 1.45B.

Since we know that B = 200, we can substitute this value into the equation to find the number of pears:

P = 1.45B
P = 1.45(200)
P = 290

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

Total number of fruits = B + P
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

Therefore, George has a total of 490 fruits.

The final answer is: 490"
"To determine the number of candy bars Marissa purchased for her brother Jimmy, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic operation. Initially, Marissa had $80 in her possession. After spending $20 on the ball, she was left with $80 - $20 = $60.

Given that each candy bar costs $5, we can calculate the number of candy bars she purchased by dividing the remaining amount by the cost of each candy bar: $\frac{\$60}{\$5} = 12$.

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for her brother Jimmy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the cost of producing 4 liters of juice, we must first calculate the total amount of oranges required. Given that 5 kilograms of oranges are necessary to produce 1 liter of juice, we can calculate the total amount of oranges needed as follows:

Let $x$ be the total amount of oranges required to produce 4 liters of juice. Then, we have:

$$x = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ kg}$$

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the oranges. Since each kilogram of oranges costs $3, the total cost can be calculated as:

$$\text{Total Cost} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars}$$

Therefore, Sam would need to spend $60 to produce 4 liters of juice.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we first need to establish the number of books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, we can express this relationship as:

Let A be the number of books Ahmed read. Then, 2A is the number of books Ezra read.

Given that Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the equation:

2A = 300

To solve for A, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

A = 300 / 2
A = 150

Therefore, Ahmed read 150 books.

Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so the total number of books Ezra will read is:

300 (initial books) + 150 (additional books) = 450

Now, we can calculate the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed:

Total books read by Ahmed = 150
Total books read by Ezra = 450
Total books read by both = 150 + 450 = 600

The final answer is: 600"
"To determine Tanya's total earnings for the two days of teaching, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then sum them.

Let's begin by calculating her earnings for Monday. Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours, which yields a total of $15/hour * 5 hours = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day. Therefore, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

Next, we calculate her earnings for Wednesday. Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours, resulting in $15/hour * 2 hours = $30. Since she teaches fewer than 3 classes, she does not receive the additional $5 per day. Consequently, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

To find the total earnings for the two days, we add the earnings for Monday and Wednesday: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To determine the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we can calculate the total sales for each category.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents, and since there are 4 vanilla scents available, the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

Similarly, the company sold 2 fruity scents, and with 8 fruity scents available, the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we can calculate the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold.

Difference = Number of vanilla scents sold - Number of fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the optimal selling price for each ear of corn, we must first calculate the revenue generated from the sale of the eggplants. Given that Bennet sells 20 eggplants at $3 each, the total revenue from eggplant sales is:

20 \* 3 = $60

Since Bennet aims to achieve a total revenue of $135, the remaining revenue required from corn sales is:

$135 - $60 = $75

With 25 ears of corn available for sale, we can calculate the required selling price per ear of corn as follows:

$$\frac{\text{Total revenue from corn sales}}{\text{Number of ears of corn}} = \frac{\$75}{25} = \$3$$

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3 to achieve his desired total revenue of $135.

The final answer is: $3"
"To determine the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we must first calculate the total time available and the time allocated to soccer.

Given that Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, the total time available for the weekend is 12 hours. We also know that she dedicates 3 hours to reading.

The remaining time after reading is 12 - 3 = 9 hours. Since she spends 1/3 of this remaining time playing video games, we can calculate this as 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

Now, we can determine the time spent playing soccer by subtracting the time spent reading and playing video games from the total time available: 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer, we use the formula: (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100.

Thus, the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer is (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of pencils Anthony kept, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

Initially, Anthony had 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which can be calculated as follows:

50 - (1/2 * 50) = 50 - 25 = 25

This leaves Anthony with 25 pencils. Subsequently, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find 3/5 of 25, we can multiply 25 by 3/5:

25 * (3/5) = (25 * 3) / 5 = 75 / 5 = 15

Now, we subtract the number of pencils given to Charlie from the remaining pencils:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total time Jack is away from home, we must consider the time spent traveling to and from the museum, as well as the time spent at the museum itself.

The time spent traveling to the museum can be calculated using the formula:

t = d / v

where t is the time, d is the distance, and v is the velocity. Given that the distance to the museum is 150 miles and the velocity is 75 mph, we can calculate the time as follows:

t = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since the distance to the museum is the same as the distance back home, the time spent traveling back is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total time spent traveling is:

t_total = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

The time spent at the museum is given as 6 hours. To find the total time Jack is away from home, we add the time spent traveling and the time spent at the museum:

t_total_away = t_total + 6 hours = 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours

Therefore, Jack is away from home for a total of 10 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of wheels left after assembling the toys, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles, and then subtract this from the initial number of wheels in the box.

The number of wheels needed for the cars can be calculated as follows:

Number of wheels for the cars = Number of cars × Number of wheels per car
= 57 × 4
= 228

Similarly, the number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is:

Number of wheels for the motorcycles = Number of motorcycles × Number of wheels per motorcycle
= 73 × 2
= 146

The total number of wheels required for both the cars and motorcycles is the sum of the wheels needed for each:

Total number of wheels required = Number of wheels for the cars + Number of wheels for the motorcycles
= 228 + 146
= 374

Now, we can find the number of wheels left by subtracting the total number of wheels required from the initial number of wheels in the box:

Number of wheels left = Initial number of wheels - Total number of wheels required
= 650 - 374
= 276

The final answer is: $\boxed{276}$"
"To determine the final price of the laptop after a 20% discount, we can apply the formula for calculating the discounted price:

Discounted price = Original price * (1 - Discount percentage)

Given the original price of the laptop is $1000 and the discount percentage is 20% or 0.20, we can substitute these values into the formula:

Discounted price = $1000 * (1 - 0.20)
Discounted price = $1000 * 0.80
Discounted price = $800

Therefore, the final price of the laptop after the 20% discount is $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so:

$$\frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200$$

Since Mike can get these movies for $6 each, the cost of the movies in series is:

$$200 \times 6 = \$1200$$

Next, let's find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:

$$600 - 200 = 400$$

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so:

$$0.4 \times 400 = 160$$

The cost of the older movies is:

$$160 \times 5 = \$800$$

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:

$$400 - 160 = 240$$

The cost of the normal movies is:

$$240 \times 10 = \$2400$$

Now, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost:

$$\1200 + \800 + \2400 = \4400$$

The total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection is $4400."
"To determine the total amount spent by Winston on the fruit, we can apply the principle of unit pricing, which is a fundamental concept in economics and decision-making under uncertainty. Given the prices of peaches ($2.00 per pound), plums ($1.00 per pound), and apricots ($3.00 per pound), we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the quantity of each fruit by its respective price and then summing the results.

Let's denote the quantities of peaches, plums, and apricots as $p_p$, $p_l$, and $p_a$, respectively, and the prices as $P_p$, $P_l$, and $P_a$. The total cost, $C$, can be expressed as:

$$C = P_p \cdot p_p + P_l \cdot p_l + P_a \cdot p_a$$

Substituting the given values, we have:

$$C = 2 \cdot 6 + 1 \cdot 8 + 3 \cdot 6$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$C = 12 + 8 + 18$$

$$C = 38$$

Therefore, the total amount spent by Winston on the fruit is $38.

The final answer is: $38"
"To determine the distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we must first calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, then sum these values.

Let's begin by calculating the speed at which they hiked. We are given that their hiking speed was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Therefore, half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at a speed of 50 miles per hour. Using the formula distance = speed × time, we find that the distance they drove is 50 × 6 = 300 miles.

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour. Using the same formula, distance = speed × time, we find that the distance they hiked is 20 × 1.5 = 30 miles.

To find the total distance to their vacation spot, we sum the distance they drove and the distance they hiked: 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{330}$"
"To determine the difference in the scores of Ava and Emma, we need to establish a system to calculate their scores based on the given conditions.

Let's denote Emma's score as $E$ and Ava's score as $A$. We are given that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, collects 3 more berries, and finishes the level 4 seconds slower.

The score for each enemy jumped on is 10 points, the score for each berry collected is 5 points, and the score for each second left on the timer is 30 points.

We can express Emma's score as $E = 10e + 5b + 30(60 - t)$, where $e$ is the number of enemies Emma jumps on, $b$ is the number of berries Emma collects, and $t$ is the time Emma takes to complete the level.

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, we can express Ava's enemy score as $10(e + 8)$. Similarly, Ava's berry score is $5(b + 3)$. Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, her timer score is $30(60 - t - 4) = 30(56 - t)$.

Ava's total score is $A = 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(56 - t)$.

The difference in their scores is $A - E = 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(56 - t) - (10e + 5b + 30(60 - t))$.

Simplifying the expression, we get $A - E = 10e + 80 + 5b + 15 + 1680 - 30t - 10e - 5b - 1800 + 30t$.

Combining like terms, we get $A - E = 80 + 15 + 1680 - 1800 = -645$.

However, this is not the difference in their scores, but rather the difference in their scores without considering the number of enemies and berries they collect. To find the actual difference, we need to consider the difference in their enemy and berry scores.

The difference in their enemy scores is $10(e + 8 - e) = 80$.

The difference in their berry scores is $5(b + 3 - b) = 15$.

The difference in their timer scores is $30(56 - t - (60 - t)) = -120$.

The difference in their scores is $80 + 15 - 120 = -25$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-25}$"
"Given that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars, and two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each, we can approach this problem by first determining the total cost of the two known pizzas and then finding the cost of the remaining two pizzas.

Let's denote the cost of each of the other two pizzas as x. The total cost of the two known pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars. 

The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. Therefore, the total cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can express this as an equation: 2x = 4, where x is the cost of each of the other two pizzas.

To find the value of x, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

2x / 2 = 4 / 2
x = 2

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas costs 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. This can be represented as a simple arithmetic series: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15. Alternatively, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. In this case, S = 5/2 * (3 + 3) = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is the sum of the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days, which is 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After purchasing W white fish and O orange fish, he had a total of 3 + O orange fish and 4 + W white fish.

Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + O = 2(4 + W)

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so we can set up another equation:

W + O = 17

We can solve the first equation for O:

O = 2(4 + W) - 3
O = 8 + 2W - 3
O = 5 + 2W

Now we can substitute this expression for O into the second equation:

W + 5 + 2W = 17

Combine like terms:

3W + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3W = 12

Divide both sides by 3:

W = 4

Therefore, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's vehicle, we must first calculate the total distance traveled in a week. Given that the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, and he commutes to and from work, the daily distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Since Andy works from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Next, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week using the formula:

Fuel consumption (gallons) = Total distance (miles) / Fuel efficiency (MPG)

Substituting the given values, we get:

Fuel consumption (gallons) = 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week

Now, we can calculate the total weekly fuel cost by multiplying the fuel consumption by the price of regular gas:

Fuel cost (dollars/week) = Fuel consumption (gallons/week) * Price of gas (dollars/gallon)
= 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon
= $15/week

Therefore, the weekly fuel cost for Andy's vehicle is $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, then sum these two values.

First, we calculate the value of the quarters. Since Carrie was given 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, the total value of the quarters is given by the product of the number of quarters and the value of each quarter:

$$140 \times 0.25 = 35$$

Thus, the value of the quarters is $35.

Next, we calculate the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and each twenty is worth $20. Since she spent 3/5 of the twenties, the amount she spent is given by the product of the number of twenties and the fraction of twenties she spent:

$$10 \times \frac{3}{5} \times 20 = 120$$

Therefore, the value of the twenties she spent is $120.

To find the total amount of money she spent, we sum the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties:

$$35 + 120 = 155$$

The final answer is: $155"
"To determine the total number of fruits that Ricardo can obtain from his garden, we need to calculate the yield of each type of plant and then sum the results.

Let's denote the number of tomato plants as T and the number of eggplant plants as E. We are given that T = 5 and E = 8.

The yield of each tomato plant is 22 fruits, and the yield of each eggplant plant is 4 fruits. Therefore, the total yield of tomato plants can be calculated as:

Total tomatoes = T * 22
Total tomatoes = 5 * 22
Total tomatoes = 110

Similarly, the total yield of eggplant plants can be calculated as:

Total eggplants = E * 4
Total eggplants = 8 * 4
Total eggplants = 32

To find the total number of fruits, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants:

Total fruits = Total tomatoes + Total eggplants
Total fruits = 110 + 32
Total fruits = 142

Therefore, Ricardo can obtain a total of 142 fruits from his garden.

The final answer is: $\boxed{142}$"
"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we can utilize a simple proportionality analysis. Given that one-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs, we can express the proportion of OLED TVs as the remaining fraction of the total.

Let's denote the total number of TVs sold as $T = 40$. The proportion of smart TVs is $\frac{1}{4}T$ and the proportion of analog TVs is $\frac{1}{8}T$. Therefore, the proportion of OLED TVs is $1 - \left(\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8}\right) = 1 - \frac{3}{8} = \frac{5}{8}$.

Now, we can calculate the number of OLED TVs sold by multiplying the proportion of OLED TVs by the total number of TVs sold: $\frac{5}{8} \cdot 40 = 25$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the amount of money John is missing, we need to calculate the total cost of the trip and subtract the amount the school will cover, as well as the amount John has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school will cover half of this amount, we can express this as:

School's contribution = (1/2) × Total cost of the trip
= (1/2) × $300
= $150

Now, we need to find the amount John is missing. This can be calculated by subtracting the amount the school will cover and the amount John has from the total cost of the trip:

Amount John is missing = Total cost of the trip - (School's contribution + Amount John has)
= $300 - ($150 + $50)
= $300 - $200
= $100

Therefore, John is missing $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we must first calculate the temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point.

Given that the temperature during the day is 45 degrees and it's 33 degrees colder during the night, the nighttime temperature is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

The temperature difference between the freezing point (32 degrees) and the nighttime temperature is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can calculate the number of logs required as follows:

$$\text{Number of logs} = \frac{\text{Temperature difference}}{\text{Heat per log}} = \frac{20}{5} = 4$$

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"To determine the total number of seashells brought back by the groups, we first need to calculate the number of groups formed and then the number of groups that brought back seashells.

Given that 90 people were required to split into groups, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we need to find the number of groups that brought back seashells. Since 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells, we can calculate this as follows:

Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we can calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups:

Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of people on the train after the two stops, we can apply a simple arithmetic operation. Initially, there are 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people disembark, resulting in a reduction of 47 individuals. This can be represented as:

172 - 47 = 125

Subsequently, 13 people board the train, increasing the total number of individuals to:

125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people disembark, leading to a further reduction of 38 individuals. This can be calculated as:

138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, the number of people on the train after the two stops is 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we can employ a straightforward calculation based on the given parameters.

Let's denote the number of bottle caps Damien finds per day as $c$, the value of each bottle cap as $v$, and the number of days in the month as $d$. Given that Damien finds 10 bottle caps per day and each cap is worth $0.25, we can express the daily earnings as $c \cdot v = 10 \cdot 0.25 = 2.50$ dollars.

To find the total earnings for the month, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in the month: $2.50 \cdot d = 2.50 \cdot 30 = 75$ dollars.

Therefore, Damien's total earnings for the month are $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours.

Let's denote Jamie's regular hourly rate as $20. For the 8 hours, her earnings can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Regular Earnings} = 8 \times \text{Hourly Rate} = 8 \times 20 = 160
$$

For the additional 3 hours, Jamie is paid a special hourly rate that is 150% of her regular hourly rate. This can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Special Hourly Rate} = 1.5 \times \text{Hourly Rate} = 1.5 \times 20 = 30
$$

Now, we can calculate her earnings for the additional 3 hours:

$$
\text{Special Earnings} = 3 \times \text{Special Hourly Rate} = 3 \times 30 = 90
$$

To find Jamie's total earnings for the day, we add her regular earnings and special earnings:

$$
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Regular Earnings} + \text{Special Earnings} = 160 + 90 = 250
$$

Therefore, Jamie's total earnings for the day are $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we identify the number of female lions, which is given as 12. The number of male lions is stated to be half the number of female lions. Therefore, we can calculate the number of male lions by dividing the number of female lions by 2: $\frac{12}{2} = 6$.

Next, we are informed that there are 14 lion cubs in the enclosure.

To find the total number of lions, we can add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs: $12 + 6 + 14 = 32$.

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To determine the amount of money Mike will have left over after purchasing the discounted jeans, we can apply the concept of percentage discount and subtraction.

First, let's calculate the discount amount:
Discount = 25% of $40
Discount = 0.25 × $40
Discount = $10

Next, we'll find the price after the discount:
Price after discount = Original price - Discount
Price after discount = $40 - $10
Price after discount = $30

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Mike will have left over after paying with a $50 bill:
Money left over = $50 - $30
Money left over = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total salary for each month, then multiply it by 3.

The company's workforce can be modeled as an arithmetic sequence, where the initial term (a) is 200 and the common difference (d) is 20. The total number of employees after 3 months can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:

a_n = a + (n - 1)d

where n is the number of terms. In this case, n = 4 (initial employees + 3 months of hiring).

a_4 = 200 + (4 - 1)20
a_4 = 200 + 60
a_4 = 260

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee. Since the number of employees is constant at 260 after the first month, we can calculate the total salary for each month as:

Total salary per month = 260 employees * $4000
Total salary per month = $1,040,000

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:

Total amount paid = Total salary per month * 3
Total amount paid = $1,040,000 * 3
Total amount paid = $3,120,000

The final answer is: $3,120,000"
"To determine the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the cumulative duration of the songs they plan to sing. Given that ""Deck the Halls"" is a 150-second song and ""Jingle Bells"" is a 240-second song, we can calculate the total caroling time as follows:

Let's denote the time for ""Deck the Halls"" as $D = 150$ seconds and the time for ""Jingle Bells"" as $J = 240$ seconds. Since the choir plans to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice, we can express the total time for this song as $2D = 2 \times 150 = 300$ seconds.

The total caroling time can be calculated by adding the time for ""Deck the Halls"" (sung twice) and the time for ""Jingle Bells"":

Total caroling time = $2D + J = 300 + 240 = 540$ seconds

Therefore, the choir will be caroling for a total of 540 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{540}$"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Let's denote Billy's initial hourly wage as $10. After 2 months, he receives a raise of $0.50 per hour, resulting in a new hourly wage of $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. Following his first anniversary, he receives an additional raise of $1.00 per hour, bringing his final hourly wage to $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we can calculate the total cost of each item and then find the difference.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is given by the product of the number of loaves and the cost per loaf: 3 × $2 = $6.

Similarly, the cost of 2 bagels is given by the product of the number of bagels and the cost per bagel: 2 × $1 = $2.

Now, to find the difference in cost, we subtract the cost of 2 bagels from the cost of 3 loaves of bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

Therefore, the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels is $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the total score of Pierson and Nikita, we first need to calculate Nikita's score. Given that Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson, we can express this relationship as:

Nikita's score = (1/2) * Pierson's score + 11

Given Pierson's score is 278, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Nikita's score = (1/2) * 278 + 11
Nikita's score = 139 + 11
Nikita's score = 150

Now, to find the total score, we add Pierson's score and Nikita's score:

Total score = Pierson's score + Nikita's score
Total score = 278 + 150
Total score = 428

The final answer is: 428"
"To determine the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign, we can break down the problem into two components: the number of trees planted by students and the number of trees planted by teachers.

First, let's calculate the total number of students. Given that there are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class, we can use the formula:

Total students = Number of classes × Average students per class
Total students = 40 × 25
Total students = 1000

Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by students is equal to the total number of students.

Total trees planted by students = Total students
Total trees planted by students = 1000

Next, we need to calculate the total number of trees planted by teachers. Given that there are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class, we can use the formula:

Total teachers = Number of classes × Average teachers per class
Total teachers = 40 × 3
Total teachers = 120

Since each teacher plants two trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is twice the total number of teachers.

Total trees planted by teachers = 2 × Total teachers
Total trees planted by teachers = 2 × 120
Total trees planted by teachers = 240

To find the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign, we add the total number of trees planted by students and the total number of trees planted by teachers.

Total trees planted = Total trees planted by students + Total trees planted by teachers
Total trees planted = 1000 + 240
Total trees planted = 1240

The final answer is: $\boxed{1240}$"
"To determine the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has and then calculate the number of stuffed goats required to make up 30% of the total.

Let's start by calculating the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. To do this, we can multiply the total number of stuffed animals by 0.3:

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30%, so we will round to the nearest whole number that will make the percentage 30% or more.

To find the total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats, we can set up the equation:

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

However, this equation is not necessary. We can simply divide 30 by 0.3 to find the total number of stuffed animals needed to make 30%:

Total number of stuffed animals = 30 / 0.3 = 100

Since Bubbles already has 14 stuffed animals, we need to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to reach a total of 100 stuffed animals:

Number of stuffed goats = 100 - 14 = 86

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30% of the total number of stuffed animals.

Let's try a different approach. We can set up the equation as follows:

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3:

14 + x = 100

However, this is not the correct equation. We need to set up the equation as follows:

"To determine the number of hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we can break down her playing schedule into two distinct periods: the first 2 weeks and the subsequent week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for half an hour every day. Since there are 14 days in a 2-week period, the total hours played during this period can be calculated as follows:

$$\text{Hours played in 2 weeks} = 14 \times 0.5 = 7 \text{ hours}$$

In the subsequent week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day. With 7 days in a week, the total hours played during this period can be calculated as follows:

$$\text{Hours played in 1 week} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ hours}$$

To find the total hours Kris has played, we sum the hours played in both periods:

$$\text{Total hours played} = 7 + 14 = 21 \text{ hours}$$

Now, to determine the number of hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we subtract the total hours played from the target hours:

$$\text{Hours still needed} = 30 - 21 = 9 \text{ hours}$$

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

"Given that two cars are traveling on a highway, with the first car maintaining a constant speed of 60 miles per hour and the second car passing it at a speed of 70 miles per hour, we can apply the concept of relative motion to determine the distance between them after 2 hours.

The relative speed between the two cars is the difference in their speeds, which is 70 mph - 60 mph = 10 mph. This relative speed represents the rate at which the distance between the two cars is increasing.

To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we can use the formula for distance, which is the product of the relative speed and the time elapsed. Therefore, the distance between the two cars after 2 hours is:

d = (70 mph - 60 mph) * 2 hours = 10 mph * 2 hours = 20 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total cost of the ring, we must first calculate the total cost of the diamond and gold, and then add the premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600, and the cost of the gold is $300. Therefore, the total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold. To calculate the premium, we can use the formula:

Premium = (Percentage \* Total Cost) / 100

Substituting the values, we get:

Premium = (0.30 \* $900) = $270

Now, we can calculate the total cost with the premium by adding the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold:

Total Cost = $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid a total of $1170 for the ring.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To determine the overall pass rate of Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade. We are given that 340 out of 500 third-graders passed, and 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed. The pass rate for the fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of the fourth-graders. Since the pass rate of the fourth-graders is 40/100, the pass rate of the fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. Therefore, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
\[ \text{Total passed} = 340 + 40 + 80 = 460 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of students:
\[ \text{Total students} = 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \]

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
\[ \text{Pass rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Total passed}}{\text{Total students}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{460}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 46\% \]

The final answer is: $\boxed{46}$"
"To determine the maximum length of the mosaic, we must first calculate the total number of square inches that can be covered with the available glass chips. Given that each square inch requires 12 glass chips, and Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, each containing 72 chips, we can calculate the total number of chips as follows:

Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips

Next, we can determine the total number of square inches that can be covered with the available chips:

Total square inches = Total chips / Chips per square inch
= 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch
= 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the maximum length:

Area = Length * Width
12 square inches = Length * 3 inches

To find the length, we can rearrange the formula to solve for length:

Length = Area / Width
= 12 square inches / 3 inches
= 4 inches

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the initial amount of tea at the party, we must first calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students. 

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is $4 \times 1.5 = 6$ quarts. 

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is $16 \times 2 = 32$ quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is $6 + 32 = 38$ quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, the total amount of tea left is 10 quarts. 

To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to add the amount of tea consumed to the amount of tea left. 

Total tea at the beginning = 38 (tea consumed) + 10 (tea left) = 48 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is $\frac{48}{4} = 12$ gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we must first calculate the total number of candies he has available for sale. Initially, Dale ordered 100 candies. After selling 150, he had a deficit of 50 candies, but this is not feasible since it implies a negative quantity of candies. Therefore, we can infer that Dale replenished his stock by ordering an additional 100 candies.

Let's denote the initial number of candies as I = 100, the number of candies sold as S = 150, and the number of additional candies ordered as A = 100. The total number of candies available for sale is the sum of the initial and additional candies, which is I + A = 100 + 100 = 200.

To find the number of candies Dale still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies available: 200 - 150 = 50.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, we can model the growth of the student population using exponential growth principles. Given that the number of students doubles every month, we can express this as a geometric progression.

Let's denote the initial number of students as $a = 10$ and the common ratio as $r = 2$. The number of months from January to May is 5. We can use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence to find the number of students at the end of May:

$$a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$a_5 = 10 \cdot 2^{5-1} = 10 \cdot 2^4 = 10 \cdot 16 = 160$$

Now, to find the number of additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

$$\text{Additional students} = a_5 - a = 160 - 10 = 150$$

Therefore, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May is 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we can employ a straightforward approach by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch.

Let's denote the total money made as M and the cost per branch as C. Given that Felix made $105 during the week, we can express this as M = $105. The cost per branch is $0.25, which we can represent as C = $0.25.

To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we can use the formula:

Total branches = M / C

Substituting the given values, we get:

Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since Felix worked for 5 days during the week, we can calculate the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by the number of days:

Average branches per day = Total branches / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

Therefore, Felix climbed an average of 84 branches per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the total number of petals in the vase, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtracting the petals that were lost due to the mishap.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers. We can represent this as the sum of the products of the number of flowers and the number of petals per flower for each set:

Total petals = (3 flowers * 5 petals/flower) + (4 flowers * 6 petals/flower) + (5 flowers * 4 petals/flower) + (6 flowers * 7 petals/flower)

Using the distributive property of multiplication, we can rewrite this expression as:

Total petals = (3 * 5) + (4 * 6) + (5 * 4) + (6 * 7)
Total petals = 15 + 24 + 20 + 42

Now, we can evaluate the expression by adding the terms:

Total petals = 15 + 24 + 20 + 42
Total petals = 101

However, we must account for the petals that were lost when Rose dropped one flower from each set. Since there are four sets of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals from the total:

Total petals = 101 - 4
Total petals = 97

Therefore, the total number of petals in the vase is 97."
"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have, we need to calculate the remaining marshmallows after accounting for those used and dropped. 

Let's denote the total number of marshmallows in the bag as M, the number of marshmallows used by John as J, the number of marshmallows used by DeSean as D, and the number of marshmallows dropped as d. We are given that M = 35, J = 9, D = 9, and d = 3.

The total number of marshmallows used and dropped is the sum of the marshmallows used by John and DeSean, plus the number of marshmallows dropped: J + D + d = 9 + 9 + 3 = 21.

To find the number of marshmallows remaining, we subtract the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number of marshmallows: M - (J + D + d) = 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are two kids, we can divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to determine the number of S'mores each kid can have: 14 / 2 = 7.

Therefore, each kid can have 7 S'mores.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total amount of money used at the arcade, we need to calculate the total time played by each individual and then multiply it by the cost per minute.

Let's denote the time Jack plays as $t_J$, the time the two friends who are worse than Jack play as $t_{F1}$ and $t_{F2}$, and the time the friend who is better than Jack plays as $t_B$. We are given that $t_J = 4 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ minutes}$, $t_{F1} = t_{F2} = \frac{1}{2}t_J = 120 \text{ minutes}$, and $t_B = \frac{3}{2}t_J = 360 \text{ minutes}$.

The total time played is the sum of the individual times: $t_{\text{total}} = t_J + t_{F1} + t_{F2} + t_B = 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 \text{ minutes}$.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is $\frac{1}{20} = \$0.05$.

The total amount of money used is the product of the total time played and the cost per minute: $t_{\text{total}} \times \frac{1}{20} = 840 \times 0.05 = \$42$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"To determine the amount of oil used in the salt scrub, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x, the amount of salt (and sugar) as 2x, and the amount of oil as 4x, since the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, and the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest.

The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces, which is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 8x = 10.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

Therefore, the amount of oil used in the salt scrub is 5 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total amount of money John spent at the market, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. The cost of the goats can be calculated as the product of the number of goats and the cost per goat, while the cost of the cows can be determined by multiplying the number of cows by the cost per cow.

Let's denote the number of goats as $g$, the cost per goat as $c_g$, the number of cows as $n_c$, and the cost per cow as $c_c$. Given that $g = 3$, $c_g = 500$, $n_c = 2$, and $c_c = 1500$, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Total cost = (number of goats) × (cost per goat) + (number of cows) × (cost per cow)
= $g \times c_g + n_c \times c_c$
= $3 \times 500 + 2 \times 1500$
= $1500 + 3000$
= $4500

Therefore, the total amount of money John spent at the market is $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine the number of additional cupcakes Paul should purchase, we can utilize a simple subtraction operation. Given that Paul requires a total of 63 cupcakes for the birthday party and he already possesses 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, we can calculate the number of additional cupcakes needed as follows:

Let x be the number of additional cupcakes Paul should purchase.

Total cupcakes needed: 63
Cupcakes already available: 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

We can express this relationship as an equation:

x = 63 - 48

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 15

Therefore, Paul should purchase 15 additional cupcakes to meet the required total of 63 cupcakes for the birthday party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother, we need to apply a step-by-step approach, leveraging basic algebraic manipulations and percentage calculations.

First, we establish that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, who has 20 cars. Therefore, Joe's initial number of cars can be expressed as 2 × 20 = 40.

Next, we calculate the number of cars Joe sells, which is 20% of his total. This can be represented as 0.2 × 40 = 8 cars.

Furthermore, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold, which is 2 × 8 = 16 cars.

To find the total number of cars Joe gave away, we sum the number of cars sold and given away: 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

Finally, to determine the number of cars Joe remains with, we subtract the total number of cars given away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother is 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount each student raised, we first need to isolate the total amount contributed by the students. Given that the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from external organizations, the students' collective contribution can be calculated as follows:

Total amount raised by the charity = $175,000
Amount raised by external organizations = $50,000

Amount raised by the students = Total amount raised by the charity - Amount raised by external organizations
= $175,000 - $50,000
= $125,000

Now, to find the individual contribution of each student, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

Number of students = 20

Individual contribution per student = Amount raised by the students / Number of students
= $125,000 / 20
= $6,250

Therefore, each student raised $6,250 for the charity.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To determine the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. This can be converted to minutes as follows:

8 hours = 8 × 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours. This can also be converted to minutes:

4 hours = 4 × 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is the sum of the time walked on the first day and the second day:

Total time = 480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first calculate the number of cars present in the parking lot when he exited class for the break.

Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, resulting in a total of 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

When Hunter exited class for the lunch break, it is stated that 1/2 of the cars had departed. This implies that 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left the parking lot.

Therefore, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot when Hunter exited class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is equivalent to the number of cars present in the parking lot at that time, which is 35.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we can calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of working days in a week. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of tasks John completes in a day. Since he does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle consists of 5 tasks, we can calculate the total number of tasks as follows:

Total tasks per day = Number of cycles per day * Number of tasks per cycle
Total tasks per day = 30 * 5
Total tasks per day = 150

Given that each task pays $1.20, we can calculate John's daily earnings as follows:

Daily earnings = Total tasks per day * Pay per task
Daily earnings = 150 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $180

Since John works a full 7-day week, we can calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his daily earnings by 7:

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * 7
Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To determine the total points Sasha scored during both games, we can break down the information provided.

Let's denote Sasha's points in the first game as S1 and Julie's points in the first game as J1. We are given that Sasha scored 14 points in the first game, so S1 = 14. We also know that Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, which implies J1 = S1 - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha's points in the second game (S2) can be expressed as S2 = J1 - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her points from both games: S1 + S2 = 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food purchased by Kimberly, we first calculate the total number of tins of each type. The number of tins of cat food can be found by multiplying the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

Similarly, the number of tins of dog food is obtained by multiplying the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

The difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food is then calculated by subtracting the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of green eggs as $g$, blue eggs as $b$, pink eggs as $p$, and yellow eggs as $y$.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. $g = 5$ (given)
2. $b = 2g$ (twice as many blue eggs as green eggs)
3. $p = b - 1$ (one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs)
4. $y = \frac{1}{3}p$ (one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs)

Substituting equation (2) into equation (3), we get $p = 2g - 1$. Substituting equation (1) into this expression, we get $p = 2(5) - 1 = 9$.

Now, we can substitute the value of $p$ into equation (4) to find the number of yellow eggs: $y = \frac{1}{3}(9) = 3$.

To find the total number of eggs, we add the number of eggs of each color together: $g + b + p + y = 5 + 2(5) + 9 + 3 = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the amount Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

The cost of shipping can be calculated using the formula:

Total Cost of Shipping = (Cost per pound * Weight of the book) + (Cost per mile * Distance)

Given:
- Cost per pound = $0.35
- Weight of the book = 4 pounds
- Cost per mile = $0.08
- Distance = 20 miles

Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:

Total Cost of Shipping = (0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20)
= 1.4 + 1.6
= $2.99

The refund amount is 75% of the purchase price, which can be calculated as:

Refund Amount = 0.75 * Purchase Price
= 0.75 * $32
= $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:

Total Loss = Total Cost of Shipping + (Purchase Price - Refund Amount)
= 2.99 + (32 - 24)
= 2.99 + 8
= $10.99

The final numerical answer is: $10.99"
"To determine the amount of money Mulan has left, we can apply basic principles of financial arithmetic. Initially, Mulan possesses $40. Following the receipt of $100 from her father, her total assets increase to $140.

The cost of two pairs of jeans, priced at $30 each, can be calculated as 2 × $30 = $60. Additionally, she purchases a bag for $20. The total expenditure is therefore $60 (jeans) + $20 (bag) = $80.

To find the remaining amount of money, we subtract the total expenditure from the initial total: $140 - $80 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the production of chocolate bars in the fourth week, we can utilize a linear model to represent the production pattern. Let's denote the production in the first week as $P_1 = 8,000$ bars.

Given that the production in the second week is half of the first week, we can express it as $P_2 = \frac{1}{2}P_1 = \frac{1}{2}(8,000) = 4,000$ bars.

Similarly, the production in the third week is three times the production of the first week, which can be represented as $P_3 = 3P_1 = 3(8,000) = 24,000$ bars.

To find the production in the fourth week, we can calculate the total production for the first three weeks and subtract it from the total monthly production of 50,000 bars.

The total production for the first three weeks is given by $P_{\text{total}} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000$ bars.

Now, we can find the production in the fourth week by subtracting the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production:

$P_4 = 50,000 - P_{\text{total}} = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000$ bars.

Therefore, the production in the fourth week is 14,000 bars."
"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on various activities per week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on writing songs per week. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 2 hours to minutes as follows:

2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Next, we calculate the time Britany spends on makeup per week. She spends 15 minutes on makeup six days a week, so we multiply the time spent per day by the number of days:

15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time Britany spends on recording videos per week. Since each video is 4 minutes long and she records 18 videos per week, we can find the total time spent on recording videos as follows:

18 videos * 4 minutes per video = 72 minutes

To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok per week, we add the time spent on writing songs, makeup, and recording videos:

120 minutes (songs) + 90 minutes (makeup) + 72 minutes (videos) = 282 minutes

We can convert the total weekly time to hours by dividing by 60:

282 minutes / 60 = 4.7 hours

Finally, to find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:

4.7 hours * 4 weeks = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{18.8}$"
"To determine the total cost of the interior design installation, we must first identify the base cost and the additional costs associated with the extra items. The base cost of the installation is $129.00, which includes the installation of 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.

Angela requires the installation of 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. To calculate the additional costs, we must subtract the items already included in the base installation from the total number of items Angela requires.

Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors, with a cost of 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier, with a cost of 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures, with a cost of 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

To find the total cost, we add the base cost and the additional costs: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To determine the amount of money Roy has saved, we can approach this problem by first establishing the known variables and then applying a step-by-step solution.

Let's denote the amount of money Eva has saved as E, Anthony as A, and Roy as R. We are given that:

1. Eva has saved $20.00, so E = $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, which implies A = E + $10.00 = $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To express this mathematically, we can write R = A + 0.4A, where 0.4A represents 40% of Anthony's savings.

Substituting the value of A into the equation, we get R = $30.00 + 0.4($30.00). To calculate 40% of $30.00, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4, which yields $12.00. Therefore, R = $30.00 + $12.00.

Performing the addition, we find that R = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To determine the height at which Naruto can lift a mountain, we must establish a hierarchical relationship between the individuals' lifting capacities. Given that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, we can deduce the lifting capacities of the other individuals through a series of multiplicative relationships.

Let's denote the lifting capacity of Pompei as $P = 1$ inch. Saskay's lifting capacity is 12 times that of Pompei, so $S = 12P = 12$ inches. 

Kagiyami's lifting capacity is 4 times that of Saskay, so $K = 4S = 4 \times 12 = 48$ inches.

Naruto's lifting capacity is 10 times that of Kagiyami, so $N = 10K = 10 \times 48 = 480$ inches.

To convert the lifting capacity from inches to feet, we divide by 12, as there are 12 inches in a foot. Therefore, $N = \frac{480}{12} = 40$ feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the total distance traveled by Mason, we can utilize the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time. Given that Mason's speed is 8 miles per hour and he travels for two distinct periods, we can calculate the distance covered in each segment and then sum them.

Let's denote the distance covered in the first 4 hours as $d_1$ and the distance covered in the next 6 hours as $d_2$. Using the formula for distance, we have:

$d_1 = 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 32 \text{ miles}$

$d_2 = 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ miles}$

The total distance $d_{\text{total}}$ is the sum of $d_1$ and $d_2$:

$d_{\text{total}} = d_1 + d_2 = 32 \text{ miles} + 48 \text{ miles} = 80 \text{ miles}$

Therefore, the total distance traveled by Mason is 80 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway, we must first establish the time it takes for a single kangaroo to complete the journey. Given that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed require 18 hours to traverse the highway, we can infer that the time taken by a single kangaroo is 18 hours multiplied by 3, which yields 54 hours.

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can apply the inverse relationship between speed and time. Specifically, if speed is halved, time is doubled. Therefore, to find the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway, we multiply the time taken by a single kangaroo by 2, resulting in 54 hours * 2 = 108 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{108}$"
"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we can utilize a linear equation to model the given information. Let's denote the number of dishes made by Kora as x. According to the problem statement, Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so the number of dishes made by Rory is x + 20. Since Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, the number of dishes made by Jada is 2(x + 20).

Given that Kora made 20 dishes, we can substitute x = 20 into the expressions for Rory and Jada's dishes:

- Number of dishes made by Kora: x = 20
- Number of dishes made by Rory: x + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
- Number of dishes made by Jada: 2(x + 20) = 2(20 + 20) = 2(40) = 80

To find the total number of dishes made by all three, we add the number of dishes each person made:
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial amount of money Erika has in her purse as x.

Given that Erika needs an additional $50 to purchase the laptop after trading in her old one, we can express the total amount of money she has as the price of the laptop after trading in her old one plus the extra money she needs: $400 + $50 = $450.

We also know that Erika received $230 from her part-time job and her mom's contribution. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + $230 = $450

To solve for x, we subtract $230 from both sides of the equation:

x = $450 - $230
x = $220

Thus, Erika has $220 in her purse.

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the number of apple slices left after Adam eats 15 slices, we need to calculate the total number of slices initially available. 

Let's denote the number of slices from large apples as L and the number of slices from small apples as S. We know that 3 large apples can be sliced into 5 pieces each, so L = 3 * 5 = 15. Similarly, 5 small apples can be sliced into 3 pieces each, so S = 5 * 3 = 15.

The total number of slices is the sum of L and S, which is 15 + 15 = 30.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, the number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number eaten, which is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of cows required to produce 25 liters of milk per day, we can utilize the concept of linear scaling. Given that each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we can establish a linear relationship between the number of cows and the total milk production.

Let's denote the number of cows as 'n' and the total milk production as 'M'. We know that M = 5n, where M is the total milk production in liters and n is the number of cows.

We are given that the farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk per day. To find the required number of cows, we can rearrange the equation to solve for 'n':

n = M / 5

Substituting M = 25, we get:

n = 25 / 5
n = 5

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find the additional number of cows required to reach the desired production level. This can be calculated as:

Additional cows required = n - 3
= 5 - 3
= 2

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

Let's start by finding the unused portion of each glue stick. The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which can be represented as a fraction of the original length of 12 millimeters. We can calculate this as follows:

$$\frac{1}{6} \times 12 = \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{12}{1} = \frac{12}{6} = 2 \text{ mm}$$

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which can be represented as a fraction of the original length of 12 millimeters. We can calculate this as follows:

$$\frac{2}{3} \times 12 = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{12}{1} = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \text{ mm}$$

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which can be represented as a fraction of the original length of 12 millimeters. We can calculate this as follows:

$$\frac{1}{2} \times 12 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{12}{1} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ mm}$$

Now, we add the unused portions together to find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used:

$$2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ mm}$$

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."
"To determine the amount of money Gabriel still needs, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. The total cost of the items he wishes to acquire is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10080. 

Gabriel's current financial resources consist of $5000 (from his weekend work) and $200 (from his brother), totaling $5200.

To find the remaining amount needed, we subtract Gabriel's available funds from the total cost of the items:

$10080 - $5200 = $4880

Therefore, Gabriel still requires $4880 to purchase the car and phone."
"To determine the change Thea received, we need to calculate the difference between the amount she paid and the cost of the hat. 

The amount she paid is comprised of four $20 bills, which can be expressed as 4 * $20 = $80.

Now, we can calculate the change by subtracting the cost of the hat from the total amount: $80 - $70 = $10.

Therefore, Thea received $10 as change."
"To determine the amount of money Craig has left, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. Initially, Craig possesses two twenty-dollar bills, which equates to a total of $40.

The cost of the six squirt guns can be calculated as 6 × $2 = $12. Similarly, the cost of the three packs of water balloons is 3 × $3 = $9.

To find the total expenditure, we sum the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons: $12 + $9 = $21.

Subtracting the total expenditure from the initial amount yields the remaining funds: $40 - $21 = $19.

Therefore, Craig has $19 left.

The final answer is: $19"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of socks and dishes collected by Jack and Peter.

Let's denote the number of socks collected by Jack as S and the number of dishes collected by Jack as D. We are given that:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes, so D = 60.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so D = 2S, which implies S = D / 2 = 60 / 2 = 30.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter's socks = 2S = 2 * 30 = 60.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter's dishes = D / 2 = 60 / 2 = 30.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = S + 2S = 3S = 3 * 30 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = D + D / 2 = 60 + 30 = 90

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To determine the number of students good at math, we can utilize a Venn diagram or the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's denote the total number of students as T, the number of students good at math as M, the number of students good at English as E, and the number of students good at both as B.

Given:
- T = 20
- M - B = 5 (students good at math only)
- E - B = 8 (students good at English only)
- B = T - (M - B + E - B) (by the principle of inclusion-exclusion)

Simplifying the equation for B:
B = T - (M - B + E - B)
B = T - (M + E - 2B)
B = 20 - (M + E - 2B)
B = 20 - M - E + 2B
B - 2B = 20 - M - E
-B = 20 - M - E
B = M + E - 20

Now, we can substitute the value of B into the equation M - B = 5:
M - (M + E - 20) = 5
M - M - E + 20 = 5
- E + 20 = 5
- E = -15
E = 15

However, this is not possible since E - B = 8 and E cannot be greater than the total number of students. This indicates that the initial assumption of B = T - (M - B + E - B) is incorrect. The correct approach is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion directly:

M = (M - B) + B
M = 5 + B

We know that the total number of students is the sum of students good at math only, students good at English only, and students good at both:
T = (M - B) + (E - B) + B
20 = 5 + 8 + B
20 = 13 + B
B = 7

Now, we can find the number of students good at math:
M = 5 + B
M = 5 + 7
M = 12

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the maximum number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and then divide it by the time each group takes to perform, including getting on and off the stage.

Let's denote the time each group takes to perform as $t_g = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10$ minutes. The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is $t_{total} = 2 \times 60 = 120$ minutes. However, we need to subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total time, so the time available for performances is $t_{available} = t_{total} - 10 = 110$ minutes.

Now, we can calculate the maximum number of groups that can perform by dividing the available time by the time each group takes to perform: $n = \frac{t_{available}}{t_g} = \frac{110}{10} = 11$.

Therefore, the maximum number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we can utilize the formula for simple interest, which is given by:

A = P(1 + rt)

where A is the total amount, P is the principal (initial investment), r is the interest rate, and t is the time period in years.

Given that the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, we can express it as a decimal: r = 0.75. The principal amount P is $300, and the time period t is 3 years.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

A = 300(1 + 0.75*3)
A = 300(1 + 2.25)
A = 300(3.25)
A = 975

Therefore, Brenda will have a total of $975 after 3 years.

The final answer is: $975"
"To determine the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars, we first need to calculate the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

Let's begin by calculating the number of white shirts with no collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with collars is 40 / 2 = 20. Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, we calculate the number of floral shirts with no buttons. Given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we can determine the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. This difference is 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the farmer's earnings, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. Given that the farmer has 900 eggs and each tray can hold 30 eggs, we can calculate the number of trays by dividing the total number of eggs by the capacity of each tray.

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30

Now, to find the farmer's earnings, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray, which is $2.5.

Earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

Therefore, the farmer's earnings from selling the eggs will be $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's analyze the problem at hand. We have two farms, Farm X and Farm Y, with initial goat populations of 55 and 45, respectively. Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y. 

To determine the number of goats left in Farm X, we subtract the number of goats sold from the initial population. This can be expressed as:

Number of goats left in Farm X = 55 - 10 = 45

The number of goats sold from Farm Y is twice the number sold from Farm X, which is 10 * 2 = 20.

To find the number of goats left in Farm Y, we subtract the number of goats sold from the initial population:

Number of goats left in Farm Y = 45 - 20 = 25

Now, to find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:

Total number of goats left = 45 + 25 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the average cost of each pair of shoes, we can employ a straightforward calculation based on the given information. James purchases 2 pairs of shoes per month, which translates to 2 * 12 = 24 pairs per year. The total expenditure on shoes per year is $2640.

Using the formula for average cost, we can calculate the average cost per pair as follows:

Average Cost = Total Expenditure / Number of Pairs
= $2640 / 24
= $110

Therefore, the average cost per pair of shoes is $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To determine the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, we must first calculate the individual costs and then apply the discount for the red food.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food can be calculated as follows:

3 \* $25 = $75

The cost of 3 baskets of red food, with a discount of $2 per basket, can be calculated as follows:

3 \* $18 - 3 \* $2 = 3 \* ($18 - $2) = 3 \* $16 = $48

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the costs of the green and red food:

$75 + $48 = $123

Therefore, the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, with the discount applied, is $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To determine the time required to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned. Given that there are 90 rooms, we can find this by dividing the total number of rooms by 2.

$$\frac{90}{2} = 45$$

Now, we need to find the total time it takes to clean 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we can multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

$$45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}$$

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

$$\frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours}$$

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the number of homes constructed each year and then summing these values.

In the first year, the town will construct 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 \* 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the cumulative total of homes built in the first two years. The cumulative total is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Doubling this amount yields 2 \* 48 = 96 homes.

Now, we can calculate the total number of homes built over the three-year period by summing the number of homes constructed each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{144}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information.

Let's denote my age as x, my brother's age as x + 3, my sister's age as x - 2, and my mom's age as 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x + 8 - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 8x + 17 = 87.

Subtract 17 from both sides: 8x = 70.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 70/8.

x = 8.75.

However, since age cannot be a decimal, we need to re-examine the equation. Let's try to find a whole number solution.

We can rewrite the equation as: 8x = 70.

Since 8x is a multiple of 8, we can try to find a whole number solution by finding the factors of 70 that are multiples of 8.

The factors of 70 are: 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35, and 70.

The multiples of 8 that are factors of 70 are: 8 and 70.

"To determine the number of packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. Given that each student requires 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students in the class, the total number of glue sticks needed is calculated as follows:

Total number of glue sticks required = Number of students × Number of glue sticks per student
= 27 × 2
= 54

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we can calculate the number of packs required by dividing the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

Number of packs required = Total number of glue sticks required ÷ Number of glue sticks per pack
= 54 ÷ 8
= 6.75

However, since Mr. Jackson can only purchase whole packs, we must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that every student receives the required number of glue sticks. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the total amount of water passing through the river at a specific point, we must consider the changes in water flow over the three-day period. 

Let's denote the initial amount of water as $W_1 = 4000$ gallons. On the second day, the water flow doubles, resulting in $W_2 = 2W_1 = 2 \times 4000 = 8000$ gallons. 

On the third day, the water flow increases by 6000 gallons, so the new amount of water is $W_3 = W_2 + 6000 = 8000 + 6000 = 14000$ gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we sum the water flow over the three days: $W_{total} = W_1 + W_2 + W_3 = 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000$ gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24000}$"
"This problem can be modeled as an exponential growth scenario, where the number of infected individuals grows at a rate proportional to the current number of infected individuals. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

N(t) = N0 * (1 + r)^t

where N(t) is the number of infected individuals at time t, N0 is the initial number of infected individuals, r is the growth rate, and t is the time in days.

Given that each infected person infects six others, the growth rate r can be calculated as:

r = 6

The initial number of infected individuals N0 is given as 10. We need to find the number of infected individuals after three days, so t = 3.

Plugging in the values, we get:

N(3) = 10 * (1 + 6)^3
N(3) = 10 * 7^3
N(3) = 10 * 343
N(3) = 3430

Therefore, the number of people infected after three days is 3430.

The final answer is: 3430"
"To determine the total amount of money received by Julieta and Rafaela as tips, we can start by calculating the total amount received by Rafaela. Since each of the 40 customers gave her a $20 tip, we can express this as a simple multiplication problem:

Rafaela's total tips = 40 customers * $20/customer = $800

Next, we need to calculate the amount received by Julieta, which is 10% less than Rafaela's total. To find 10% of Rafaela's total, we can multiply her total by 0.1:

10% of Rafaela's total = 0.1 * $800 = $80

Now, we can subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total:

Julieta's total = Rafaela's total - 10% of Rafaela's total
= $800 - $80
= $720

To find the total amount received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we can add their individual totals:

Total tips = Rafaela's total + Julieta's total
= $800 + $720
= $1520

The final answer is: $1520"
"To determine the number of oranges Jennifer remained with, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, let's calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. Since she has three daughters, and each received 2 oranges, the total number of oranges given to her daughters is 3 * 2 = 6. Additionally, her only son received 3 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 + 3 = 9.

Now, to find the number of oranges Jennifer remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges: 12 - 9 = 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in a 1-year time frame, we can establish a ratio of their badge-earning rates. Let's denote the time it takes Claire to earn a badge as 't'. Since Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge, her time is 2t. Wendy, on the other hand, earns three times the number of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so her badge-earning rate is 3/t.

Given that Claire earns 1 badge per month, we can express her monthly badge-earning rate as 1/t. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of badges earned by Claire in a year is 12/t.

Now, let's calculate the total number of badges earned by Amber and Wendy in a year. Amber's monthly badge-earning rate is 1/(2t), so in a year, she earns 12/(2t) = 6/t badges. Wendy's monthly badge-earning rate is 3/t, so in a year, she earns 3/t * 12 = 36/t badges.

To find the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:

36/t - 6/t = 30/t

Since we are interested in the difference in the number of badges earned, we can simplify the expression by multiplying both sides by t (assuming t ≠ 0), which yields:

30

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total amount raised by Paige, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold, and then multiply that by the price per slice.

Given that Paige bakes 2 loaves per hour and she operates for 5 hours, the total number of loaves baked is 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Since each loaf is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for $0.50, so we can calculate the total amount raised by multiplying the total number of slices by the price per slice:

Total amount raised = 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40

However, to express this in a more precise mathematical notation, we can use the following expression:

Total amount raised = 80 \* 0.50 = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"Given that Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins and she has 70 gold coins, we can establish a linear relationship between the number of silver coins (S) and gold coins (G). The equation representing this relationship is G = S + 30.

Since we are given that G = 70, we can substitute this value into the equation to solve for S:

G = S + 30
70 = S + 30

To isolate S, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

70 - 30 = S + 30 - 30
40 = S

Now that we have determined the number of silver coins (S = 40), we can calculate the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins:

Total coins = S + G
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

Therefore, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.

The final answer is: 110"
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic, we need to calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students and Mr. George.

First, we calculate the total number of burritos eaten by the students. Given that there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos consumed by the students can be calculated as follows:

Burritos consumed by students = Number of students × Burritos per student
= 50 × 10
= 500

Next, we need to account for the burritos consumed by Mr. George. It is given that he ate 20 burritos.

Total burritos consumed = Burritos consumed by students + Burritos consumed by Mr. George
= 500 + 20
= 520

Now, we can determine the total number of leftover burritos by subtracting the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered:

Total leftover burritos = Initial number of burritos - Total burritos consumed
= 600 - 520
= 80

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink, we can utilize a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of red cars as R, green cars as G, blue cars as B, and yellow cars as Y.

We are given that the rink has 12 red cars, so R = 12. Additionally, we know that the number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, which can be expressed as G = R - 2. Substituting the value of R, we get G = 12 - 2 = 10.

Furthermore, the rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, which can be represented as B = 3G. Substituting the value of G, we get B = 3(10) = 30.

The total number of cars in the rink is given as 75, which is the sum of red, green, blue, and yellow cars. This can be expressed as R + G + B + Y = 75. Substituting the values of R, G, and B, we get 12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75.

Simplifying the equation, we get 52 + Y = 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract 52 from both sides of the equation, yielding Y = 75 - 52 = 23.

Therefore, the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink is 23.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We are given two equations:

1. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
2. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can express S in terms of F by substituting the second equation into the first equation:

S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

We also know that the total number of books is 85, so we can write the equation:

S + A + F = 85

Substituting the expression for S into this equation, we get:

(F + 13) + A + F = 85

Combine like terms:

2F + A + 13 = 85

Now, substitute the expression for A from the second equation:

2F + (F - 12) + 13 = 85

Combine like terms:

3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

F = 28

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To determine the weight of the carrots, we must first establish the weight of the sweet potatoes. Given that the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, we can express this relationship as:

Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * Weight of potatoes
Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * 5
Weight of sweet potatoes = 10 pounds

Next, we need to calculate the weight of the carrots, which is 3 pounds less than the weight of the sweet potatoes. This can be expressed as:

Weight of carrots = Weight of sweet potatoes - 3
Weight of carrots = 10 - 3
Weight of carrots = 7 pounds

Therefore, the weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To determine the total cost of Jello for Greg's son's birthday party, we must first calculate the total number of Jello cups required. Given that there will be 30 children and each child will receive 4 Jello cups, the total number of cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since a single box of Jello yields 10 cups, the number of boxes required can be calculated as 120 / 10 = 12.

The cost of a single box of Jello is $1.25. Therefore, the total cost can be determined by multiplying the number of boxes needed by the cost per box: 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the change the seller will receive, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones and subtract it from the amount given by the seller. 

The cost of each phone is $700, and the seller purchased 5 phones. Therefore, the total cost of the phones can be calculated as follows:

Total Cost = Number of Phones × Cost per Phone
Total Cost = 5 × $700
Total Cost = $3500

Now, we need to find the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount given by the seller:

Change = Amount Given - Total Cost
Change = $4000 - $3500
Change = $500

Therefore, the seller will receive $500 in change.

The final answer is: $500"
"To determine the weekly expenditure of Keenan, we first need to calculate his monthly expenditure. Given that Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

Let's denote the total monthly expenditure as $400. We can express Keenan's monthly expenditure as 40% of $400, which is equivalent to 0.4 × 400 = $160.

To find Keenan's weekly expenditure, we divide his monthly expenditure by the number of weeks in a month, which is 4. Therefore, Keenan's weekly expenditure is $160 ÷ 4 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces consumed on each day and sum them up.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. This can be calculated as follows:

$$\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24$$

So, on the first day, Tobias consumed 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the number of remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces consumed on the first two days from the total:

$$60 - 24 - 10 = 26$$

Now, we calculate 7/13 of the remaining pieces:

$$\frac{7}{13} \times 26 = \frac{7 \times 26}{13} = \frac{182}{13} = 14$$

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate on each day:

$$24 + 10 + 14 = 48$$

Therefore, Tobias has eaten a total of 48 pieces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we can employ a straightforward approach by first calculating the unit price of each item and then multiplying it by the desired quantity.

Let's begin by finding the unit price of a bottle of soda. Given that 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, we can calculate the unit price as follows:

$$\frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00$$

This indicates that each bottle of soda costs $3.00. Similarly, we can find the unit price of a bottle of water by dividing the total cost of 4 bottles of water by 4:

$$\frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00$$

Now that we have the unit prices, we can calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:

$$\text{Cost of 3 bottles of soda} = 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00$$
$$\text{Cost of 2 bottles of water} = 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00$$

Therefore, the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is:

$$9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00$$

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To determine the amount of money David has left after purchasing the bolts, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts. This can be done by multiplying the number of bolts by the cost per bolt:

16 bolts * $0.03 per bolt = $0.48

Next, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after purchasing the bolts.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine Ella's earnings after 12 hours of dog walking at a constant rate, we must first calculate her hourly wage. This can be achieved by dividing the total earnings by the number of hours worked.

Let's denote Ella's hourly wage as $w. Given that she earned $33 for 3 hours of work, we can express this relationship as:

$33 = w \times 3

To solve for w, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

w = $33 / 3
w = $11

Now that we have determined Ella's hourly wage, we can calculate her earnings after 12 hours of work by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours worked:

Earnings after 12 hours = w \times 12
Earnings after 12 hours = $11 \times 12
Earnings after 12 hours = $132

Therefore, Ella's earnings after 12 hours of dog walking at a constant rate would be $132.

The final answer is: $132"
"To determine the number of marbles Paul has left, we can apply a step-by-step approach based on the given information.

Initially, Paul possesses 52 marbles. His friend then gifts him 28 marbles, resulting in a total of 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Subsequently, Paul experiences a loss of 1/4 of his marbles. To calculate this loss, we can express it as a fraction of the total marbles he had after receiving the gift: 1/4 * 80. This can be computed as (1/4) * 80 = 80/4 = 20.

Now, we subtract the marbles lost from the total marbles he had after receiving the gift: 80 - 20 = 60.

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she earns from each type of question and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the points earned from the multiple-choice questions. Since Amy correctly answers 80% of these questions and each question is worth 1 point, we can express this as:

Multiple-choice points = 10 questions * 0.8 * 1 point = 8 points

Next, we'll calculate the points earned from the true/false questions. Amy correctly answers 90% of these questions, and each question is also worth 1 point. This can be expressed as:

True/false points = 20 questions * 0.9 * 1 point = 18 points

Lastly, we'll calculate the points earned from the long-answer questions. Amy correctly answers 60% of these questions, and each question is worth 5 points. This can be expressed as:

Long-answer points = 5 questions * 0.6 * 5 points = 15 points

Now, we can sum these values to find Amy's total score:

Total points = Multiple-choice points + True/false points + Long-answer points
             = 8 points + 18 points + 15 points
             = 41 points

The final answer is: $\boxed{41}$"
"To determine the cost price of the chickens, we first need to calculate the total revenue Isaias will generate from selling the chickens. Given that he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens at $50 each, we can calculate the total revenue as follows:

Total revenue = (3/5) * 300 * $50

Using the distributive property of multiplication, we can rewrite this expression as:

Total revenue = (3 * $50) * (300/5)
Total revenue = $150 * 60
Total revenue = $9000

However, we are told that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total revenue required to achieve this profit is:

Total revenue = Cost price + Profit
Total revenue = Cost price + $2000

Since we know the total revenue is $9000, we can set up the equation:

$9000 = Cost price + $2000

To solve for the cost price, we can subtract $2000 from both sides of the equation:

Cost price = $9000 - $2000
Cost price = $6000

Therefore, the cost price of the chickens is $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To determine the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah, we can first calculate the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell. Since they sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses sold by 2.

Let's denote the total number of glasses sold as $T$, the number of glasses sold by Julie as $J$, and the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell as $M$. We are given that $T = 32$ and $J = 14$. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can express this as $M = M_{Micah} = M_{Mitchell}$.

We can then express the total number of glasses sold as the sum of the glasses sold by Julie and the glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell: $T = J + 2M$. Substituting the given values, we get:

$32 = 14 + 2M$

Solving for $M$, we get:

$2M = 32 - 14$
$2M = 18$
$M = 18/2$
$M = 9$

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, each of them sold 9 glasses. To find the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah, we can subtract the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie:

$J - M = 14 - 9$
$J - M = 5$

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we can break down the costs of each service. Let's denote the cost of the hair service as H, the cost of the manicure as M, and the cost of the pedicure as P.

Given that the cost of the hair service is $400, we can express the cost of the manicure as M = (1/4)H = (1/4)($400) = $100.

Furthermore, the cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, which can be expressed as P = (3/4)M = (3/4)($100) = $75.

Now, to find the total amount spent at the spa, we can add the costs of the hair service, manicure, and pedicure: Total = H + M + P = $400 + $100 + $75 = $575.

The final answer is: $575"
"To determine the amount of money Sarah will have left over after purchasing the new rope, we can apply a straightforward financial analysis.

First, let's calculate the revenue generated from selling the rope. Given that the rope is 20 meters long and her friend is willing to buy it for $2 per meter, the total revenue can be calculated as follows:

Revenue = Price per meter × Length of rope
= $2/meter × 20 meters
= $40

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and Sarah plans to purchase a rope of the same length (20 meters). Therefore, the total cost of the new rope is:

Cost = Price per meter × Length of rope
= $1.5/meter × 20 meters
= $30

Now, to find the amount of money Sarah will have left over after purchasing the new rope, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the revenue generated from selling the original rope:

Amount left over = Revenue - Cost
= $40 - $30
= $10

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after purchasing the new rope.

The final answer is: $10"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age, we can use a simple algebraic approach.

Let's denote the current age of Melanie as 'A' and the number of years it takes for her age to be thrice her present age as 't'. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, so her current age is A = 18 - 10 = 8 years.

We can set up the equation based on the given condition: A + t = 3A. Substituting the value of A, we get 8 + t = 3(8).

Simplifying the equation, we get 8 + t = 24.

Now, solving for t, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: t = 24 - 8.

Therefore, t = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

- The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
- The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120, since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
- The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
- The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14, since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart:

Total cost = $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:

$65 - $156 = -$91.

Since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly has overspent her budget by $91.

The final numerical answer is: $-91"
"To determine the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we can establish an equation based on the given information. Let x represent the runtime of her usual concerts in minutes. The final concert, being twice as long as her usual concerts, has a runtime of 2x minutes. Additionally, the 15-minute encore is performed at the end of the concert. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, which can be expressed as:

2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we can isolate the variable by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

Thus, the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the number of toys Argo has now, we can apply the principle of subtraction, which is a fundamental operation in arithmetic. Given that Argo initially possessed 200 toys, we need to subtract the total number of toys he gave away to Alyssa, Bonnie, and Nicky.

The number of toys given away can be calculated by summing the individual quantities: 40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky) = 150 toys.

Now, we can apply the subtraction operation to find the current number of toys Argo has: 200 (initial toys) - 150 (toys given away) = 50 toys.

Therefore, Argo currently possesses 50 toys.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays and Wednesdays: 125 + 125 = 250. 

Next, we calculate the number of chimichangas made on Fridays, which is twice the number made on Tuesdays or Wednesdays: 2 * 125 = 250.

Finally, we sum the number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays: 250 + 250 = 500.

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

The final answer is: $\boxed{500}$"
"To determine the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage, we need to consider the total number of microphones and the percentage that cannot be accommodated.

Let's denote the total number of microphones as M. We are given that 20% of the microphones cannot be arranged, which implies that 80% of the microphones can be arranged in pairs. We can express this as:

Number of microphones that can be arranged = 0.8M

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of pairs can be calculated as:

Number of pairs = (0.8M) / 2

We are given that M = 50. Substituting this value, we get:

Number of pairs = (0.8 * 50) / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and then sum them up.

First, let's consider the number of birds nesting in the bushes, which is given as 6. 

Next, we have 2/3 of the number of birds flying overhead. To find this, we can multiply the number of birds nesting by 2/3: 

$$\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = \frac{2 \times 6}{3} = \frac{12}{3} = 4$$

Now, we have 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we can multiply the number of groups by the number of birds per group:

$$3 \times 8 = 24$$

Now, let's add the number of birds in each group to find the total:

$$6 + 4 + 24 = 34$$

Therefore, Jerry counts a total of 34 birds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the number of cookies in each jar, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic operation. Given that Lani baked a total of 55 cookies and consumed 5, we can calculate the remaining cookies as follows:

Let's denote the total number of cookies as $T$, the number of cookies eaten as $E$, and the number of cookies in each jar as $C$. We are given that $T = 55$ and $E = 5$. The number of cookies left is then $T - E = 55 - 5 = 50$.

Since the remaining cookies are distributed equally into 5 jars, we can calculate the number of cookies in each jar by dividing the total remaining cookies by the number of jars:

$$C = \frac{T - E}{\text{Number of jars}} = \frac{50}{5} = 10$$

Therefore, there are 10 cookies in each jar.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids, we first calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower. The orchids have 5 petals each, and there are 5 orchids, so the total number of petals for the orchids is given by the product of these two quantities: $5 \times 5 = 25$ petals.

Similarly, the daisies have 10 petals each, and there are 4 daisies, so the total number of petals for the daisies is given by the product of these two quantities: $4 \times 10 = 40$ petals.

Now, to find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals for the orchids from the total number of petals for the daisies: $40 - 25 = 15$ petals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we can employ a step-by-step approach.

First, we identify the total number of plants, which is given as 100. We then calculate the number of indoor plants, which is one-fourth of the total: $\frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25$ indoor plants.

The remaining plants are outdoor or flowering plants. To find the number of outdoor plants, we calculate two-thirds of the remaining plants: $\frac{2}{3} \times (100 - 25) = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50$ outdoor plants.

The number of flowering plants is then the difference between the remaining plants and the outdoor plants: $75 - 50 = 25$ flowering plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: $\frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25\%$.

Therefore, the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden is 25%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, whatchamacallit, and thingamabob. Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as $v_{tb}$, the speed of the whatchamacallit as $v_{wc}$, and the speed of the whirligig as $v_{wg}$. We are given that the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, so we can express this relationship as:

$$v_{wc} = 11v_{tb}$$

We are also given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

$$121 = 11v_{tb}$$

Solving for $v_{tb}$, we get:

$$v_{tb} = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ m/s}$$

Now, we are told that the whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, so we can express this relationship as:

$$v_{wg} = 5v_{tb}$$

Substituting the value of $v_{tb}$, we get:

$$v_{wg} = 5(11) = 55 \text{ m/s}$$

Therefore, the whirligig spins at 55 meters per second.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To determine the cost of one carrot, we can establish an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of one carrot as 'x'. Since Ellen consumes two carrots daily, the total cost of the carrots is 2x. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is $3.

Given that the total daily expenditure is $11, we can set up the following equation:

2x + 6 + 3 = 11

Combine the constants: 2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2: x = 1

Therefore, the cost of one carrot is $1."
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the total number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's hourly wage was initially $10, and it was increased by $2. Therefore, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, which is a total of 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

To find Mark's weekly earnings, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 
Since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x + 3x + 5x = 9x. 

We are given that she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. Therefore, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

Rearranging the equation to solve for y, we get y = 80 - 54x.

Since we are not given the exact number of lawns Tasha mowed, we cannot directly solve for x. However, we can express y in terms of x. 

To find the amount she made from lemonade sales, we need to find the value of y when x is known. Since we are not given the exact number of lawns Tasha mowed, we can use the fact that she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. This implies that x = 1.

Substituting x = 1 into the equation y = 80 - 54x, we get y = 80 - 54(1) = 80 - 54 = 26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To determine Harry's weight, we can establish a sequence of relationships between the individuals' weights.

Let's denote Martin's weight as M, Carl's weight as C, Christian's weight as Ch, and Harry's weight as H. We are given the following information:

1. M = 55 kg
2. C = M + 16
3. Ch = C + 8
4. H = Ch - 5

Substituting the value of M into equation (2), we get:
C = 55 + 16
C = 71 kg

Now, substituting the value of C into equation (3), we get:
Ch = 71 + 8
Ch = 79 kg

Finally, substituting the value of Ch into equation (4), we get:
H = 79 - 5
H = 74 kg

Therefore, Harry's weight is 74 kg.

The final answer is: $\boxed{74}$"
"To determine the profit John makes from renting his car, we need to calculate his total revenue and subtract his car payment. 

First, let's calculate the total revenue. The number of times John rents his car is 10, the number of hours per rental is 3, and his hourly rate is $25. We can use the formula for total revenue:

Total revenue = Number of times rented * Number of hours per rental * Hourly rate
Total revenue = 10 * 3 * $25
Total revenue = $750

Next, we need to subtract the car payment from the total revenue to find the profit.

Profit = Total revenue - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

Therefore, John's profit from renting his car is $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic notation to represent the given information.

Let M represent the initial number of notebooks Martha had. According to the problem, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so we can represent the number of notebooks Joseph had as 3M.

We are also given that Martha bought 5 more notebooks and now has a total of 7 notebooks. This can be represented as M + 5 = 7.

To find the initial number of notebooks Martha had, we can solve the equation M + 5 = 7 for M. Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation yields M = 2.

Now that we know Martha initially had 2 notebooks, we can find the number of notebooks Joseph had by multiplying 2 by 3, which gives us 6.

To determine how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has: 7 - 6 = 1.

Therefore, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the distance rowed by Dijana as D and the distance rowed by Anis as A.

Given that Dijana rowed 50 miles, we have D = 50. 

It is also stated that Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. This can be expressed as A = D + (1/5)D.

Substituting the value of D, we get A = 50 + (1/5)(50) = 50 + 10 = 60.

Now, to find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we add their individual distances: D + A = 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"To determine the number of cookies each of Susan's nephews will receive, we must first account for the cookies taken by her husband. Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband's removal of 4 cookies results in a reduction of the total number of cookies available for distribution.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Total cookies available = Initial cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Total cookies available = 100 - 4
Total cookies available = 96

Next, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to find out how many each will receive. The number of nephews is given as 6.

Number of cookies per nephew = Total cookies available / Number of nephews
Number of cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Number of cookies per nephew = 16

Therefore, each of Susan's nephews will receive 16 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel, we can calculate their individual totals and then find the difference.

Let's denote the number of pages Denise read yesterday as $D_y$ and the number of pages Daniel read yesterday as $D_{dy}$. We are given that $D_y = 10$ and $D_{dy} = 13$.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which can be expressed as $D_y + 5 = D_{dy} + 5$. Since we know $D_y = 10$, we can substitute this value to find the number of pages Denise read today: $10 + 5 = 15$.

However, we are also given that Daniel did not read any pages today, so his total remains $D_{dy} = 13$.

To find the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel, we can subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: $D_y + (D_y + 5) - D_{dy} = 10 + 15 - 13 = 12$.

Therefore, Denise read 12 more pages than Daniel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to consider the capacity of the pot and the number of people eating dinner.

Let's denote the capacity of the pot as C. Since the pot can fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls, we can express this relationship as:

C = 4A = 8C'

where A represents the number of adult's bowls and C' represents the number of child's bowls.

Since there are 4 adults and 2 children, a total of 6 people will eat dinner. We can express the number of bowls used as:

A = 4
C' = 4 (since 4 adult's bowls = 4 child's bowls)

The total number of bowls used is 6, and since the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, the number of bowls left over is:

C' = 8 - 4 = 4

Each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, and there are 2 children. To find the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we can divide the number of bowls left over by the number of children:

Number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch = C' / 2
= 4 / 2
= 2

"To determine the total amount William spent, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the cost of the notebooks. Since William purchased five notebooks at $1.50 each, we can express this as a multiplication problem: 5 × $1.50. Using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can rewrite this as (5 × $1) + (5 × $0.50). 

Now, we can perform the multiplication operations: 5 × $1 = $5 and 5 × $0.50 = $2.50. Adding these results together, we get $5 + $2.50 = $7.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the ballpen, which is $0.50.

To find the total amount William spent, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together: $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the total material required for Jo's face mask production, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the material needed for small and large masks separately and then summing these values.

First, let's calculate the material required for the small masks. Given that 2 yards of material can produce 4 small masks, the material per small mask is:

$$\frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards/mask}$$

For 20 small masks, the total material required is:

$$20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards/mask} = 10 \text{ yards}$$

Next, we calculate the material needed for the large masks. With 2.25 yards of material producing 3 large masks, the material per large mask is:

$$\frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards/mask}$$

For 8 large masks, the total material required is:

$$8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards/mask} = 6 \text{ yards}$$

Therefore, the total material needed for both small and large masks is the sum of the individual requirements:

$$10 \text{ yards (small masks)} + 6 \text{ yards (large masks)} = 16 \text{ yards}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. Given that she saw each of the 9 movies three times, the total number of tickets she purchased is 9 * 3 = 27.

The total expenditure incurred by Deepa is $216. To calculate the average price per ticket, we divide the total expenditure by the total number of tickets:

Average price per ticket = Total expenditure / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

Therefore, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine Harold's free time, we must first consider the total hours available in a day, which is 24 hours. 

Let's denote Harold's sleep duration as S, work duration as W, and dog-walking duration as D. We are given that S = 10 hours, W = S - 2 = 8 hours, and D = 1 hour.

The total time spent on these activities is the sum of S, W, and D, which is S + W + D = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours.

To find Harold's free time, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time available in a day.

"To determine the number of shoeboxes left in Tim's box, we first need to calculate the number of red shoeboxes used for fishing. Given that 1/3 of the red shoeboxes were used, we can express this as a fraction of the total number of red shoeboxes.

Let's denote the total number of red shoeboxes as R. Then, the number of red shoeboxes used is (1/3)R. We are given that the total number of red shoeboxes is 9, so we can substitute R = 9 into the equation:

(1/3)R = (1/3)(9) = 3

This means that 3 red shoeboxes were used for fishing.

Now, let's calculate the number of blue shoeboxes used. We are given that 3 blue shoeboxes were used.

Initially, Tim had 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes. After using 3 blue and 3 red shoeboxes, he is left with:

Blue shoeboxes: 7 - 3 = 4
Red shoeboxes: 9 - 3 = 6

Therefore, the total number of shoeboxes left is 4 (blue) + 6 (red) = 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the current number of books Joseph has, we must first establish the initial number of books he possessed. Since Joseph had twice the number of books as Sarah, and Sarah has 9 books, we can express this relationship as a simple ratio.

Let's denote the number of books Sarah has as S, and the number of books Joseph has as J. We know that J = 2S. Given that S = 9, we can substitute this value into the equation to find J.

J = 2S
J = 2(9)
J = 18

However, we are informed that Joseph lost 2 books. To find the current number of books Joseph has, we need to subtract the number of lost books from his initial total.

J_current = J - 2
J_current = 18 - 2
J_current = 16

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To determine the number of marbles Dean has left, we need to calculate the total number of marbles he gave away and subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's calculate the number of marbles Dean gave to Jamie. Since he gave 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie, we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{1}{5} \cdot 30$. To find the product, we multiply the numerator and denominator: $\frac{1}{5} \cdot 30 = \frac{30}{5} = 6$.

Next, we know Dean gave 10 marbles to Donald. Therefore, the total number of marbles he gave away is the sum of the marbles given to Jamie and Donald: $6 + 10 = 16$.

Now, we can find the number of marbles Dean has left by subtracting the total number of marbles given away from the initial amount: $30 - 16 = 14$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can express this relationship as:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago

Substituting the given information, we have:

(60 - 8) = 2x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

52 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we obtain:

x = 26

This value represents Adam's age four years ago. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = x + 4 = 26 + 4 = 30

Finally, to determine Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

The final answer is: $\boxed{38}$"
"To determine the total acres of the two farms, we first need to calculate the acres of Farmer Smith's farm. Given that Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, we can express Farmer Smith's farm as 2 * 200 + 100, which is a simple arithmetic operation.

2 * 200 = 400
400 + 100 = 500

Therefore, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres. To find the total acres of both farms, we add the acres of Farmer Brown's farm to the acres of Farmer Smith's farm.

200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres

"To determine Colby's earnings in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Let's denote the number of packages Colby completes per hour as $p$. We are given that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so we can express this as $p = 50 - 10 = 40$ packages per hour.

In an 8-hour workday, the total number of packages Colby completes is given by the product of his hourly rate and the number of hours worked, which is $p \cdot 8 = 40 \cdot 8 = 320$ packages.

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day are $320 \cdot 0.20 = 64$ dollars.

Therefore, Colby's earnings in a typical eight-hour workday are $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To determine the number of bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku, we must first calculate the time it takes to complete this task. A normal sudoku puzzle requires 45 minutes to solve. An extreme sudoku, being a more complex variant, takes four times as long to solve, which is 4 × 45 = 180 minutes.

Given that John consumes a bottle of water every 30 minutes, we can calculate the total number of bottles consumed by dividing the total time spent solving the extreme sudoku by the time interval between water consumption. This can be expressed as:

$$\frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles}$$

Therefore, John consumes 6 bottles of water while solving an extreme sudoku.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation to represent the given scenario. Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as y. Since there are 20 red balloons, the total number of balloons is 20 + y.

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3 * y.

The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, so we can set up the equation: 40 + 3y = 58.

To solve for y, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation: 3y = 18.

Then, we divide both sides by 3: y = 6.

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of tune-ups required for Jon's vehicle, we must first calculate the total distance traveled over the 30-day period. Given that Jon drives 100 miles per day, the total distance can be computed as follows:

Total distance = 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since the vehicle requires a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can calculate the number of tune-ups needed by dividing the total distance by the interval between tune-ups:

Number of tune-ups = Total distance / Interval between tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

Therefore, Jon's vehicle will require 3 tune-ups over the 30-day period.

"To determine the total hours Bruce works over the three-day period, we can utilize a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

Let's denote the hours worked on Tuesday as T. Given that Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday, we have T = 5.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which can be expressed as 2T. Substituting the value of T, we get 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which can be represented as 2T - 2. Substituting the value of 2T, we get 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, to find the total hours worked over the three days, we can sum the hours worked each day: T + 2T + (2T - 2) = 5 + 10 + 8.

Simplifying the expression, we get 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the amount of allowance each girl received, we can approach this problem by first calculating the total expenditure and then dividing it by 2.

Let's denote the amount of allowance each girl received as x. Since they combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is 2x.

The cost of the cake is $11. The cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, the number of 2-balloon sets is 12 / 2 = 6. So, the cost of 1 dozen balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since the total amount of money they had is 2x, we can set up the equation 2x = $28. To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

$$
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{28}{2}
$$

$$
x = \frac{28}{2}
$$

$$
x = 14
$$

Therefore, each girl received $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To determine the number of pieces of fruit left after Lola ate 2 pieces, we first need to calculate the total number of fruits Kira purchased. This can be achieved by summing the quantities of each type of fruit.

Let's denote the number of apples as A, bananas as B, and oranges as O. We are given that A = 3, B = 5, and O = 6. Therefore, the total number of fruits, denoted as T, is:

T = A + B + O
T = 3 + 5 + 6
T = 14

Next, we need to subtract the number of fruits Lola ate, denoted as L, from the total number of fruits. We are given that L = 2. Therefore, the number of fruits left, denoted as F, is:

F = T - L
F = 14 - 2
F = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students participating in each sport and then sum these values.

Let's begin by identifying the number of students playing tennis. We are given that there are 6 students participating in this activity.

Next, we are informed that the number of students playing volleyball is twice the number playing tennis. Therefore, the number of students playing volleyball is 2 * 6 = 12.

Moving on to the soccer team, we are provided with the number of boys and girls participating. There are 16 boys and 22 girls, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, to find the total number of students, we sum the number of students participating in each sport: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The total number of students is 56."
"To determine the profit generated from the sale of lollipops, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. The number of students is 30, each student sold 10 lollipops, and the price per lollipop is $0.8. Therefore, the total revenue can be computed as follows:

Total revenue = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Price per lollipop
Total revenue = 30 * 10 * $0.8
Total revenue = 300 * $0.8
Total revenue = $240

Next, we calculate the total cost. The cost per lollipop is $0.5, and the number of lollipops sold is the same as the number of students, which is 30. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Cost per lollipop
Total cost = 30 * 10 * $0.5
Total cost = 300 * $0.5
Total cost = $150

Now, we can determine the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = $240 - $150
Total profit = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we must first establish the relationships between the different types of pets. Let's denote the number of cats as C, dogs as D, rabbits as R, fish as F, and gerbils as G.

Given that Larry has 3 cats, we can express this as C = 3.

Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, we can express this as D = 3C. Substituting the value of C, we get D = 3(3) = 9.

We are also given that he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, which can be expressed as R = D - 2. Substituting the value of D, we get R = 9 - 2 = 7.

The number of fish in the tank is three times the number of rabbits, so F = 3R. Substituting the value of R, we get F = 3(7) = 21.

Lastly, the number of gerbils is one-third the number of fish, which can be expressed as G = F/3. Substituting the value of F, we get G = 21/3 = 7.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: C + D + R + F + G = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47.

The final answer is: $\boxed{47}$"
"To determine the duration for which the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the combined daily consumption of Abby and Josh. Given that Abby consumes 2 slices per day and Josh consumes twice as much as Abby, his daily consumption is 2 * 2 = 4 slices.

The combined daily consumption of both Abby and Josh is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

To find the number of days the loaf of bread will last, we divide the total number of slices by their combined daily consumption: 24 / 6 = 4.

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To determine the number of shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Martha began collecting shells at the age of 5, and we are interested in the cumulative total by her 10th birthday.

Given that Martha collects one shell per month, we can calculate the total number of shells by multiplying the number of years she has been collecting by the number of months in a year. Since Martha has been collecting shells for 5 years, we can express this as:

5 years × 12 months/year = 60 months

Now, we can calculate the total number of shells collected by multiplying the total number of months by the number of shells collected per month:

60 months × 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to establish the total number of cups allocated to mint tea. Since Lana brews equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, let's denote the number of cups in each row as x. 

We know that the total number of cups is 27, and there are 3 rows. Therefore, the total number of cups in each row is 27 / 3 = 9. 

Since the number of cups in each row is 9, the total number of cups allocated to mint tea is 2x, as there are equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row. 

We are given that the remaining cups after allocating mint and chamomile tea are used to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea. This implies that the total number of cups allocated to mint and chamomile tea is 27 - 15 = 12. 

Since the total number of cups allocated to mint tea is 2x, we can set up the equation 2x = 12 to find the value of x. Solving for x, we get x = 6. 

However, this is the number of cups in each row, not the number of mint tea cups. Since there are equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is x / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the minimum number of berries the three-toed sloth can collect per trip, we must first calculate the total number of trips the sloth can make within the given time frame. Given that each round trip takes 4 hours, the sloth can make 8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips.

Since the sloth aims to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he can make 2 trips, we can calculate the minimum number of berries he must collect per trip as follows:

Let x be the number of berries collected per trip. The total number of berries collected in 2 trips is 2x. We want this to be equal to 24 berries, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 24

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 24 / 2
x = 12

Therefore, the minimum number of berries the sloth can collect per trip is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we first need to calculate the initial amount of water transferred to the tank. Given that the pool contains 10,000 gallons of water and the tank is filled with half of this amount, the initial water volume in the tank is:

V_initial = 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 gallons

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of water used from the tank over a period of 6 days. The tank is emptied at a constant rate of 500 gallons per day. Therefore, the total water usage over 6 days can be calculated as:

V_usage = 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3,000 gallons

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the total water usage from the initial water volume:

V_remaining = V_initial - V_usage
= 5,000 - 3,000
= 2,000 gallons

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"Given the constraints of Colby's monthly budget of $150, we can calculate the remaining funds available for movie expenditures. 

Let's denote the number of movies seen on Fridays and Saturdays as $F$, the number of movies seen on other days as $O$, the number of tubs of popcorn purchased as $P$, and the number of boxes of candy bought as $C$. We are given that $F = 5$, $O = 8$, $P = 2$, and $C = 4$.

The cost of tickets for Fridays and Saturdays is $10 per movie, and for other days is $7 per movie. The cost of popcorn is $8 per tub, and the cost of candy is $2 per box. 

We can express the total cost of the movies as $10F + 7O$ and the total cost of snacks as $8P + 2C$. The total cost of all expenditures is $10F + 7O + 8P + 2C$. 

Given that Colby's monthly budget is $150, we can express this as an equation:

$$10F + 7O + 8P + 2C \leq 150$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$10(5) + 7(8) + 8(2) + 2(4) \leq 150$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$50 + 56 + 16 + 8 \leq 150$$

$$130 \leq 150$$

This inequality holds true, indicating that Colby has not exceeded his budget.

Now, let's calculate the remaining budget for movie tickets:

$$150 - 130 = 20$$

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and Colby wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see one more movie on a Friday or Saturday. This leaves him with:

$$20 - 10 = 10$$

for other days. 

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see:

$$\frac{10}{7} \approx 1.4286$$

Since we can't see a fraction of a movie, we round down to 1 movie on other days.

In total, Colby can see:

$$1 + 1 = 2$$

movies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then sum them. 

First, we'll calculate the calories of a mini cinnamon roll. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini pastry has 1/3 of the calories of a normal version. Therefore, the calories of a mini cinnamon roll can be calculated as follows:

$$\frac{1}{3} \times 600 = \frac{600}{3} = 200$$

Since Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, the total calories from cinnamon rolls are given by:

$$200 \times 200 = 40,000$$

Next, we'll calculate the calories of a mini blueberry muffin. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini pastry has 1/3 of the calories of a normal version. Therefore, the calories of a mini blueberry muffin can be calculated as follows:

$$\frac{1}{3} \times 450 = \frac{450}{3} = 150$$

Since Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, the total calories from blueberry muffins are given by:

$$300 \times 150 = 45,000$$

The total calories from both types of pastries are the sum of the calories from cinnamon rolls and blueberry muffins:

$$40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{85000}$"
"To determine the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed and then divide it by the number of days.

Let's start by calculating the total number of Junebugs removed. On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs per day. Therefore, the total number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs, and on Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs removed is the sum of the Junebugs removed each day: 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300.

Since there are 5 days in total, we can calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total number of Junebugs removed by the number of days: 300 / 5 = 60.

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is 60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car, we can apply the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time. 

Given that the bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, its total distance traveled can be calculated as:

d_bus = v_bus * t_bus = 60 mph * 5 h = 300 miles

Similarly, for the car traveling at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, its total distance traveled is:

d_car = v_car * t_car = 30 mph * 8 h = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:

Δd = d_bus - d_car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the number of bouncy balls, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of bouncy balls as x. The total number of toys before purchasing the bouncy balls is the sum of the blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings, which is 31 + 8 + 9 = 48. The total number of toys after purchasing the bouncy balls is given as 62. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

48 + x = 62

To solve for x, we subtract 48 from both sides of the equation:

x = 62 - 48
x = 14

Thus, the number of bouncy balls is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Given the problem statement, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. P + Pp + J = 100
2. Pp = J + 10
3. P = Pp + J

From equation (2), we can substitute Pp with J + 10 in equation (1):
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now, we can substitute P with Pp + J from equation (3) in the above equation:
(Pp + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Substitute Pp with J + 10 from equation (2):
(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 80/4
J = 20

Now that we have J, we can find Pp:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 20 + 10
Pp = 30

Now that we have Pp, we can find P:
P = Pp + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total number of water balloons, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Initially, Maria had 1 water balloon, and each of her 4 friends had 2 balloons. This yields a total of 9 balloons, as calculated below:

1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9

Subsequently, Maria's mom provided each individual with 3 additional balloons. Given that there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:

5 * 3 = 15

To obtain the final tally, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:

9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24

Therefore, the total number of water balloons is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of tables required for the charity yard sale, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of items and then divide that by the number of boxes that can be accommodated per table.

First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of items. The charity group receives 10 donations of 5 boxes each, resulting in 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. Additionally, they already have 10 boxes, bringing the total to 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Next, we need to determine the number of tables required to accommodate these boxes. Since each table can hold 2 boxes, we divide the total number of boxes by 2: 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, the charity group already owns 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total required: 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 additional tables to accommodate the items for the yard sale.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney in their watermelon seed spitting contest, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each participant and then divide by the total number of seeds spat.

Let's denote the number of seeds spat by Zoey as $n_Z = 40$ and the number of seeds spat by Sydney as $n_S = 35$. The distance spat by each seed for Zoey is denoted as $d_Z = 10$ feet, and for Sydney, it is $d_S = 12$ feet.

The total distance spat by Zoey is given by the product of the number of seeds and the distance spat per seed, i.e., $D_Z = n_Z \cdot d_Z = 40 \cdot 10 = 400$ feet. Similarly, the total distance spat by Sydney is $D_S = n_S \cdot d_S = 35 \cdot 12 = 420$ feet.

The total distance spat by both participants is the sum of their individual distances, i.e., $D_{total} = D_Z + D_S = 400 + 420 = 820$ feet.

The total number of seeds spat is the sum of the seeds spat by both participants, i.e., $n_{total} = n_Z + n_S = 40 + 35 = 75$ seeds.

The average total distance spat is then given by the ratio of the total distance spat to the total number of seeds spat, i.e., $\frac{D_{total}}{n_{total}} = \frac{820}{75} = 10.9333...$ feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10.93}$"
"To determine the difference in revenue between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

Let $n$ be the number of hours the machines operate in a month. Since the machines operate 24 hours a day and there are 30 days in a month, we have $n = 24 \cdot 30 = 720$ hours.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour, so the total number of widgets it produces in a month is $60 \cdot 720 = 43,200$ widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour, so the total number of widgets it produces in a month is $45 \cdot 720 = 32,400$ widgets.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine:

The price of each widget is $6. Therefore, the total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000 is $43,200 \cdot 6 = 259,200$ dollars.

The total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 is $32,400 \cdot 6 = 194,400$ dollars.

Now, let's find the difference in revenue:

$259,200 - 194,400 = 64,800$ dollars.

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To determine the cost savings for Cameron's stay, we need to calculate the cost of his stay with the 24-hour option and the cost of his stay with the 12-hour option plus the additional hours.

Cameron's stay spans from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. 

The 24-hour option costs 1600 pesos. 

The 12-hour option costs 1000 pesos, and Cameron needs to add 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark. Since he stays for 17 hours, he needs to add 70 * 5 = 350 pesos for the additional 5 hours.

So, the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find the cost savings, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the 12-hour option with additional hours over the 24-hour option.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To determine the total amount of hay required for Nate's livestock, we need to calculate the individual hay needs of the goats and sheep, and then sum these values.

First, let's establish the hay requirements for each animal. We know that each goat requires 5 pounds of hay. Since each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can express this relationship as:

Sheep's hay requirement = (2 * Goat's hay requirement) - 3
Sheep's hay requirement = (2 * 5) - 3
Sheep's hay requirement = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay requirement = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total hay required for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay required for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: 159"
"To determine the number of 25 dollar pens John can purchase after accounting for his expenses, we must first calculate his net earnings after deducting the gas cost and the deposit from his total earnings.

Let's denote John's hourly wage as $w = 50, the number of hours worked as $h = 6, the gas cost as $g = 50, and the deposit as $d = 100. We can express John's total earnings as $E = wh = 50 * 6 = 300.

Next, we calculate John's remaining money after deducting the gas cost and the deposit: $M = E - g - d = 300 - 50 - 100 = 150.

Now, let's consider the cost of the pencils, denoted as $p. Since John buys 5 pencils at $10 each, we have $p = 5 * 10 = 50.

We can then calculate John's remaining money after purchasing the pencils: $M' = M - p = 150 - 50 = 100.

Finally, to determine the number of 25 dollar pens John can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of each pen: $n = M' / 25 = 100 / 25 = 4.

Therefore, John can purchase 4 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Given the scenario, we can calculate the total number of letters in the words Craig and his brother have spelled after ten rounds. 

Let's denote the number of words Craig spelled as C and the number of letters in each word as L. We are given that C = 20 and L = 15. Therefore, the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled is CL = 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. This can be represented as (C + 50). Since we know C = 20, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled is (20 + 50) * L = 70 * 15 = 1050.

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is the sum of the letters in Craig's words and his brother's words: CL + (C + 50)L = 300 + 1050 = 1350.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1350}$"
"To determine the total number of children participating in the drill, we can apply the principle of multiplication, specifically the associative property, to calculate the product of the number of children in each row, the number of rows, and the number of schools.

Let's denote the number of children in each row as $n$, the number of rows as $r$, and the number of schools as $s$. In this scenario, we have $n = 8$, $r = 7$, and $s = 5$.

The total number of children can be calculated as follows:

Total number of children = $n \times r \times s$
= $8 \times 7 \times 5$
= $8 \times (7 \times 5)$
= $8 \times 35$

"To determine the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to calculate the total number of bottles given to the students and subtract this from the total number of bottles she obtained from redeeming her coupons.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles given to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice. This can be expressed as:

Total bottles given to students = 29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles the teacher obtained from redeeming her coupons. Each coupon is redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice, and she has 9 coupons. This can be expressed as:

Total bottles obtained from coupons = 9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Now, to find the number of bottles the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she obtained:

Bottles left = Total bottles obtained from coupons - Total bottles given to students
= 900 bottles - 58 bottles
= 842 bottles

The final answer is: $\boxed{842}$"
"To determine the total amount Patty charged for the job, we need to calculate the labor cost, which is a function of the hourly rate and the duration of the job, as well as the cost of parts and the visit fee.

Given that the job took 2.25 hours and the labor rate is $35 per hour, we can calculate the labor cost as follows:

Labor cost = Hourly rate × Duration
Labor cost = $35/hour × 2.25 hours
Labor cost = $78.75

The cost of parts is given as $60, and the visit fee is $40. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts + Visit fee
Total cost = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To determine the financial outcome of James' transaction, we must first calculate the total cost of the CDs before and after the discount, and then account for the revenue generated from selling a subset of the CDs.

The original price of 10 CDs is $15 each, so the total cost is:

$$
\text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 15 = \$150
$$

Given that James received a 40% discount, the amount deducted from the original price is:

$$
\text{Discount} = 0.4 \times 150 = \$60
$$

Therefore, the price James paid for the CDs is:

$$
\text{Price after Discount} = 150 - 60 = \$90
$$

James then sold 5 CDs for $40 each, resulting in a revenue of:

$$
\text{Revenue} = 5 \times 40 = \$200
$$

To determine the financial outcome, we compare the revenue to the price James paid for the CDs:

$$
\text{Financial Outcome} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Price after Discount} = 200 - 90 = \$110
$$

Since James made a profit of $110, he was out $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To determine the total earnings from Jen's root crops, we need to calculate the revenue generated from each type of crop and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the yams. The price per yam is $1.5, and Jen has 6 yams. Therefore, the revenue from yams is given by the product of the price per yam and the number of yams: $1.5 \times 6 = $9.

Next, we calculate the revenue from the sweet potatoes. The price per sweet potato is $2, and Jen has 10 sweet potatoes. Thus, the revenue from sweet potatoes is $2 \times 10 = $20.

Lastly, we determine the revenue from the carrots. The price per carrot is $1.25, and Jen has 4 carrots. Therefore, the revenue from carrots is $1.25 \times 4 = $5.

To find the total earnings, we sum the revenues from each type of root crop: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To determine the time it took James to cross the lake, we can break down the problem into three distinct segments: the initial swimming segment, the resting period, and the final swimming segment.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to swim 60% of the 20-mile lake. The distance covered in this segment is 0.6 × 20 = 12 miles. Given James' swimming speed of 2 miles per hour, the time taken for this segment is:

$$t_1 = \frac{d_1}{v} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}$$

After completing the initial swimming segment, James rests for half the duration of the initial swimming segment, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

Next, we need to calculate the time it took James to cover the remaining distance of 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. However, James swims at half his initial speed of 2 miles per hour, which is 1 mile per hour. Therefore, the time taken for the final segment is:

$$t_3 = \frac{d_3}{v_3} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}$$

The total time taken by James to cross the lake is the sum of the time taken for the initial swimming segment, the resting period, and the time taken for the final segment:

$$t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of loaves of bread the bakery has as B and the number of loaves Sam had last Friday as S.

Given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we can express the relationship between the number of loaves the bakery has and the number Sam had as:

B = 7S - 40

Substituting the known value of S into the equation, we get:

B = 7(70) - 40

Using the distributive property of multiplication, we can simplify the expression:

B = 490 - 40

Performing the subtraction, we find:

B = 450

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final answer is: 450"
"To determine the number of stickers Jasmine has at the end, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. Initially, Jasmine was given 15 stickers for participating in class. However, she lost 7 stickers during playtime, resulting in a net loss of 7 stickers. This can be represented as:

15 (initial stickers) - 7 (stickers lost) = 8

Subsequently, her teacher awarded her 5 additional stickers for helping her classmates. This can be represented as:

8 (stickers remaining) + 5 (stickers awarded) = 13

Therefore, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

13"
"To determine the total commission earned by Cayley from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, we can apply the formula for commission, which is given by:

Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100

For the New York Times, the commission rate is 10% and the price per copy is $5. Therefore, the commission earned from the New York Times is:

Commission from New York Times = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
= (300) / 100
= $3

For the Wall Street Journal, the commission rate is 8% and the price per copy is $15. Therefore, the commission earned from the Wall Street Journal is:

Commission from Wall Street Journal = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
= (1200) / 100
= $12

The total commission earned by Cayley is the sum of the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal:

Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
= $3 + $12
= $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Given the problem statement, we can establish a system of linear equations to solve for Leo's age. Let's denote Leo's age as L, Deanna's age as D, and Marcus's age as M.

From the information provided, we have the following equations:

1. M = D - 5 (Marcus is five years younger than Deanna)
2. M = 0.5L (Marcus is half of Leo's age)

We are given that Deanna's age, D, is 26. Substituting this value into equation 1, we get:

M = 26 - 5
M = 21

Now, we can substitute the value of M into equation 2 to solve for L:

21 = 0.5L

To isolate L, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

2(21) = L
42 = L

Therefore, Leo's age is 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D.

We are given that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. We can also express the total points scored by the team as B + A + D = 45.

Substituting B = A + 20 into the equation B + A + D = 45, we get (A + 20) + A + D = 45. Simplifying this equation, we have 2A + D + 20 = 45.

Similarly, substituting B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45, we get (D + 10) + A + D = 45. Simplifying this equation, we have 2D + A + 10 = 45.

Now, we have two equations: 2A + D + 20 = 45 and 2D + A + 10 = 45. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get (2A + D + 20) - (2D + A + 10) = 45 - 45. Simplifying this, we have A - D + 10 = 0.

Rearranging the equation, we get A - D = -10. Adding D to both sides, we get A = D - 10.

Substituting A = D - 10 into the equation B = A + 20, we get B = (D - 10) + 20. Simplifying this, we have B = D + 10.

Substituting B = D + 10 into the equation B = A + 20, we get D + 10 = A + 20. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we have D = A + 10.

Now, we have A = D - 10 and D = A + 10. Substituting D = A + 10 into the equation A = D - 10, we get A = (A + 10) - 10. Simplifying this, we have A = A.

However, this is a trivial equation, and we can proceed with the substitution A = D - 10 into the equation 2A + D + 20 = 45. This gives us 2(D - 10) + D + 20 = 45. Simplifying this, we have 3D - 20 + 20 = 45.

This simplifies to 3D = 45. Dividing both sides by 3, we get D = 15.

Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = 15 - 10. Simplifying this, we have A = 5.

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we must consider the printing density and the thickness of the book. Given that each paper is printed on both sides, the effective number of pages per inch is twice the number of pages per inch if only one side were printed. Therefore, the effective number of pages per inch is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

Since the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can calculate the total number of pages by multiplying the effective number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches: 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. The time interval from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

15 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know that Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we can divide 900 by 15:

900 minutes ÷ 15 minutes/set = 60 sets

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 60 sets of 15 minutes, we can calculate the total number of reports stapled as follows:

30 reports/set × 60 sets = 1800 reports

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1800}$"
"To determine the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim's usual sleep schedule is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is equivalent to 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we have 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her wake-up time is 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m. This means her actual sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m.

To find the actual sleep duration, we calculate the time difference between 10 p.m. and 5:55 a.m. Converting 10 p.m. to a 24-hour clock, we have 22:00. The time difference is 22:00 - 05:55 = 16 hours and 5 minutes. Converting this to minutes, we have 16 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 5 minutes = 965 minutes.

Since she was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes, we subtract this from her actual sleep duration: 965 - 23 = 942 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{942}$"
"To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we first need to establish the initial quantities of measuring cups and spoons. Given that Jonathan has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of cups as follows:

2 dozen = 2 × 12 = 24 cups

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can express this relationship as a ratio. To find the number of spoons, we multiply the number of cups by 2/3:

24 cups × (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, we can calculate the remaining number of spoons by subtracting 6 from the initial quantity:

16 spoons - 6 spoons = 10 spoons

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we sum the remaining spoons and cups:

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

The final numerical answer is: 34"
"To determine the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the initial number of occupied beds. Given that 1/5 of the hospital's 1000 beds are occupied, we can express this as a fraction of the total capacity.

$$\frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200$$

Since 1/5 of the beds are occupied, 4/5 of the beds are unoccupied. We can calculate this as follows:

$$\frac{4}{5} \times 1000 = 800$$

Next, we need to calculate the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks, considering that 50 patients are admitted each day. With 14 days in 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted is:

$$50 \times 14 = 700$$

Adding the initial number of occupied beds to the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks gives us the total number of occupied beds:

$$200 + 700 = 900$$

Finally, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds:

$$1000 - 900 = 100$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to calculate the number of non-work emails. Since Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work-related, the number of non-work emails is given by:

16 (total emails) - 7 (work emails) = 9 (non-work emails)

Next, we are told that two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family. This can be expressed as:

(2/3) × 9 = 6 (emails to family)

Now, we need to find the number of non-work emails that are not to family. This is given by:

9 (non-work emails) - 6 (emails to family) = 3 (non-work emails not to family)

Finally, we are told that one-third of the remaining non-work emails are to her boyfriend. This can be expressed as:

(1/3) × 3 = 1 (emails to boyfriend)

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine Shawna's father's age, we can utilize a step-by-step approach based on the given information.

Let's denote Aliya's age as A, Shawna's age as S, and Shawna's father's age as F. We are given the following relationships:

1. F = 5S (Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna)
2. S = 3A (Shawna is three times as old as Aliya)
3. A = 3 (Aliya is 3 years old)

From equation 3, we know Aliya's age is 3 years. Substituting this value into equation 2, we can determine Shawna's age:

S = 3A
S = 3(3)
S = 9

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can use equation 1 to find Shawna's father's age:

F = 5S
F = 5(9)
F = 45

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the percentage of the reported number that represents the actual attendance. Since Kelly stated that Courtney overestimated the number by 20%, we can express this as a percentage decrease.

Let x be the actual number of people who attended the concert. We can set up the equation:

48 = x + (20% of x)

To find 20% of x, we multiply x by 0.20:

48 = x + 0.20x

Combine like terms:

48 = 1.20x

Now, divide both sides by 1.20 to solve for x:

x = 48 / 1.20

x = 40

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of balls carried by each boy. Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as x, Jason as 2x, and Jordan as 4x, since Jordan carries twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carries twice as many balls as Jeffrey.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls. Therefore, we can set up the equation 2x = 2 and solve for x.

2x = 2
x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the total number of balls by substituting x into the expression for the total number of balls, which is the sum of the balls carried by each boy: x + 2x + 4x = 7x.

Total number of balls = 7x
Total number of balls = 7 * 1
Total number of balls = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we can start by calculating the total number of holes at the end of the third day. The pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day, but they filled in 2 holes. Therefore, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is given by:

10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes

We are told that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day:

40 - 29 = 11 holes

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is 11.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"Given that Amora and Lainey received an equal number of corn chips, denoted as x, and Collins received 15 more corn chips than each of them, we can establish the following equation:

x + x + (x + 15) = Total

Since Amora and Lainey received 70 corn chips each, we can substitute x = 70 into the equation:

70 + 70 + (70 + 15) = Total

Combine like terms:

140 + 85 = Total

Simplify the expression:

225 = Total

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is 225.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To determine the cost of travel, we must first understand that it is 50% more than the cost of supplies. This can be calculated as follows:

Let S represent the cost of supplies, which is $400. The cost of travel (T) is 50% more than S, which can be expressed as:

T = S + 0.5S
T = 1.5S

Substituting the value of S, we get:

T = 1.5 * $400
T = $600

Therefore, the cost of travel is $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L.

We are given that the total number of Pokémon caught is 339, so we can express this as the equation A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, which can be expressed as L = S + 5.

Furthermore, we are told that Stan has caught 13 fewer Pokémon than 4 times the number caught by Adelwolfe, which can be expressed as S = 4A - 13.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.
This simplifies to A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Next, we can substitute the third equation into the previous one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.
Expanding the equation, we get A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.
Combining like terms, we have 9A - 21 = 339.

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation, we get 9A = 360.

Dividing both sides by 9, we find A = 40.

Now that we know the value of A, we can find S by substituting A into the equation S = 4A - 13:
S = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a direct relationship between the number of episodes and the total viewing time. Let's denote the number of episodes as 'e' and the length of each episode as 'l'. We are given that the length of each episode (l) is 20 minutes, and the number of episodes (e) is half the length of each episode, which can be expressed as e = l/2.

Substituting the given value of l = 20 minutes into the equation, we get e = 20/2 = 10 episodes.

To find the total viewing time (T), we multiply the number of episodes (e) by the length of each episode (l): T = e * l = 10 * 20 = 200 minutes.

Therefore, the total time John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we can utilize the concept of displacement, which is a fundamental principle in kinematics. Displacement is the change in position of an object with respect to a reference frame, and it is a vector quantity.

Given the bird's flight pattern, we can break down the journey into three segments:

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
2. The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
3. The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.

We can calculate the displacement in the southerly direction by multiplying the speed by the time for each segment and summing the results:

Displacement in the first segment = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles
Displacement in the last segment = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

However, the displacement in the northerly direction must be subtracted from the total displacement in the southerly direction to find the net displacement:

Displacement in the northerly direction = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Net displacement = Displacement in the first segment + Displacement in the last segment - Displacement in the northerly direction
Net displacement = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Net displacement = 374 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta received. We can express this as the sum of the brownies she made for herself, the brownies she received from her office, and the brownies she received from her friends.

Let's denote the number of brownies Greta made for herself as $B_1$, the number of brownies she received from her office as $B_2$, and the number of brownies she received from her friends as $B_3$. We know that $B_1 = 12$, $B_2 = 6$, and $B_3 = 48$.

The total number of brownies Greta received is given by the sum $B_{\text{total}} = B_1 + B_2 + B_3 = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66$.

Next, we need to account for the number of brownies that were eaten during the party. We can express this as $B_{\text{eaten}} = 1.5 \cdot 12 = 18$.

To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she received: $B_{\text{left over}} = B_{\text{total}} - B_{\text{eaten}} = 66 - 18 = 48$.

Therefore, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total age of all three family members, we can start by identifying the age of Nani's brother. Since his brother is twice Nani's age, we can express this relationship as:

Brother's age = 2 × Nani's age
Brother's age = 2 × 8
Brother's age = 16

Next, we need to find the age of Nani's sister, who is 25% younger than Nani. This can be represented as:

Sister's age = Nani's age × (1 - 0.25)
Sister's age = 8 × 0.75
Sister's age = 6

Now, we can calculate the total age of all three family members by summing their individual ages:

Total age = Nani's age + Brother's age + Sister's age
Total age = 8 + 16 + 6
Total age = 30

Therefore, the total age of all three family members is 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total time required to string all 12 racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and sum them up. 

Let's denote the time for synthetic gut racquets as SG, polyester string racquets as PS, and hybrid racquets as H. We have 3 racquets for synthetic gut, 5 for polyester string, and 4 for hybrid sets. The time for each type of string is given as 15 minutes for synthetic gut, 22 minutes for polyester string, and 18 minutes for hybrid sets.

The time for synthetic gut racquets can be calculated as SG = 3 * 15 = 45 minutes. Similarly, the time for polyester string racquets is PS = 5 * 22 = 110 minutes, and the time for hybrid racquets is H = 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

The total time required to string all the racquets is the sum of the time for each type of string: Total time = SG + PS + H = 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

"To determine the total cost of the phones, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Let's denote the cost of the first two phones as $600 each, and the cost of the remaining two phones as $300 each, since they are half the price of the initial two.

The cost of the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The cost of the remaining two phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the first two phones to the cost of the remaining two phones: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

Therefore, the total cost for all four phones is $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To determine the total number of players in both teams, we can utilize a straightforward arithmetic approach. Given that Carlton's team has 13 players, and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Let's denote the number of players in Zeke's team as Z and the number of players in Carlton's team as C. We are given that C = 13. We also know that Z = C + 7.

Therefore, Z = 13 + 7 = 20.

To find the total number of players in both teams, we can add the number of players in Zeke's team and Carlton's team: Z + C = 20 + 13 = 33.

The final answer is: 33"
"To determine the total number of wooden slats required for the rectangular fence, we must first calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

P = 2(l + w)

where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Given that the length (l) of the fence is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(15 + 10)
P = 2(25)
P = 50 feet

Since Robert requires 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we can calculate the total number of slats needed by multiplying the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = P * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

Therefore, the total number of wooden slats required for the fence is 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we must first calculate the total number of oranges she had initially and then subtract the number she kept from the total.

Given that Mrs. Harrington purchased 12 boxes of oranges, each containing 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she had initially is 12 * 20 = 240.

Next, we need to calculate the number of oranges she gave away to her mom and sister. Since each of them received 2 boxes, the total number of boxes given away is 2 + 2 = 4. Therefore, the total number of oranges given away is 4 * 20 = 80.

Now, we can calculate the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington had left after giving some away: 240 - 80 = 160.

Since Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges she kept by multiplying the total number of oranges by 1/4: 1/4 * 160 = 40.

To find the number of oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total number of states in both the United States of America (USA) and India, we must first establish the number of states in each country. The USA is a federal republic comprising 50 states, as per the United States Constitution. 

India, on the other hand, has a federal structure with 29 states and 8 union territories. However, for the purpose of this calculation, we will consider the 29 states as the primary administrative divisions.

Given that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can express this relationship mathematically as:

India's states = (1/2) * USA's states + 4
India's states = (1/2) * 50 + 4
India's states = 25 + 4
India's states = 29

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the USA and India:

Total states = USA's states + India's states
Total states = 50 + 29
Total states = 79

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries is 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"To determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to purchase. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Therefore, the total cost of the items is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Given that Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5). This can be expressed as:

$$\frac{\text{Amount needed to earn}}{\text{Hourly wage}} = \frac{\$25}{\$5}$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$\frac{\$25}{\$5} = 5$$

Therefore, Tyler needs to work for 5 hours to afford his books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of cherries Jerry has, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as $R$, the number of cherries Jerry has as $J$, and the total number of cherries as $T$. We are given that $T = 60$, $R = 30$, and $R = J + 10$. 

We can express the relationship between the number of cherries each person has as:

$$R + J + T = 60$$

Substituting $R = J + 10$ into the equation, we get:

$$(J + 10) + J + 60 = 60$$

"To determine the total earnings from the fundraiser, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let G represent the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday and A represent the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. G = 10 (number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday)
2. A = 15 - 4 (number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday, since 4 fewer boxes were sold on Saturday than on Sunday)
3. G + 5 = 15 (number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday, since 5 more boxes were sold on Sunday than on Saturday)
4. A + 4 = 15 (number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday, since 4 more boxes were sold on Sunday than on Saturday)

We can simplify equations 3 and 4 to find the values of G and A.

G + 5 = 15
G = 10

A + 4 = 15
A = 11

Now that we have the values of G and A, we can calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

Total earnings on Saturday = (G * 6) + (A * 15) = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225
Total earnings on Sunday = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday = 225 + 315 = 540

The final answer is: $\boxed{540}$"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need for her 8-day vacation, we must first calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use. Given that she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day.

The total number of times she will reapply sunscreen over the 8-day period is given by the product of the number of reapplications per day and the number of days: 4 reapplications/day * 8 days = 32 reapplications.

Since each reapplication requires 1 ounce of sunscreen, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is 32 ounces.

To find the number of sunscreen bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen required (32 ounces) by the capacity of each bottle (8 ounces). This yields:

$$\frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}$$

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Given that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, and the price of the blue car is $100, we can calculate the price of the red car by applying a discount to the price of the blue car.

To find the discount, we can use the formula:

Discount = (Discount percentage / 100) × Price of blue car
= (40 / 100) × $100
= 0.4 × $100
= $40

The price of the red car is then given by:

Price of red car = Price of blue car - Discount
= $100 - $40
= $60

Therefore, the price of the red car is $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we can simply add their prices:

Total cost = Price of blue car + Price of red car
= $100 + $60
= $160

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's analyze the given information to determine the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother.

Given that Emil is currently 19 years old, we can establish the following relationships:

1. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This implies that his dad's age at that time will be 2 * 24 = 48 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This implies that his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

To find the current age of Emil's dad, we subtract the number of years until Emil turns 24 from his age at that time: 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

Similarly, to find the current age of Emil's brother, we subtract the number of years until Emil turns 24 from his age at that time: 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total number of beads Adrianne has, we can utilize a simple arithmetic progression. Let's denote the number of beads given by her mother as M, her sister as S, and her friend as F.

We are given that M = 20. The number of beads given by her sister is 10 more than her mother, so S = M + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30. The number of beads given by her friend is twice as many as her mother, so F = 2M = 2 * 20 = 40.

To find the total number of beads, we can simply add the number of beads given by each individual: M + S + F = 20 + 30 + 40 = 90.

Therefore, Adrianne has a total of 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we must first calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught. 

Let's denote the amount of crawfish Joe caught on Thursday as $T$, Friday as $F$, and Saturday as $S$. We are given that $T = 3$ pounds. On Friday, Joe caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, so $F = 4T = 4(3) = 12$ pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, so $S = \frac{1}{2}F = \frac{1}{2}(12) = 6$ pounds.

Now, we can find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught by adding the amounts from each day: $T + F + S = 3 + 12 + 6 = 21$ pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: $\frac{21}{3} = 7$.

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we first need to identify the number of football players in the class. Given that 20% of the class are football players, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we need to find the number of students who are not football players. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of football players from the total number of students:

30 students - 6 students = 24 students.

Now, we need to find the number of cheerleaders or band members. Given that 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or band members, we can calculate this as follows:

25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders or band members:

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie, we must first calculate the sum of their shoe sizes and then divide by 2. 

Let's denote Sophie's shoe size as S = 5. Since Charlie's shoe size is five times that of Sophie's, we can express it as C = 5S = 5(5) = 25.

The sum of their shoe sizes is S + C = 5 + 25 = 30.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 2: (S + C) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

Therefore, the average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to consider the total length of the bed and the space required for each plant. The flower bed is 111 feet long, which is equivalent to 1332 inches. Each plant requires 12 inches of space, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant.

Let's denote the number of plants as 'n'. The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is given by the equation:

12n + 18n = 1332

Combining like terms, we get:

30n = 1332

To solve for 'n', we can divide both sides of the equation by 30:

n = 1332 / 30
n = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants. However, this calculation assumes that the plants are placed at the ends of the bed, which is not the case. To find the actual number of plants that can fit, we need to consider the space required for the first and last plant. 

Let's denote the number of spaces between plants as 'n - 1'. The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is given by the equation:

12n + 18(n - 1) = 1332

Expanding the equation, we get:

12n + 18n - 18 = 1332

Combining like terms, we get:

30n - 18 = 1332

Adding 18 to both sides of the equation, we get:

30n = 1350

To solve for 'n', we can divide both sides of the equation by 30:

n = 1350 / 30
n = 45

However, this is still not the correct answer, as we need to consider the space required for the first and last plant. To find the actual number of plants that can fit, we need to subtract 1 from the result:

n = 45 - 1
n = 44

However, this is still not the correct answer. Let's re-evaluate the equation:

12n + 18(n - 1) = 1332

Expanding the equation, we get:

12n + 18n - 18 = 1332

Combining like terms, we get:

30n - 18 = 1332

Adding 18 to both sides of the equation, we get:

30n = 1350

To solve for 'n', we can divide both sides of the equation by 30:

n = 1350 / 30
n = 45

"To determine the number of pretzels Edgar's brother consumes in a week, we first need to calculate his daily consumption. Given that he eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, who consumes 18 pretzels per day, we can express this relationship as a fraction.

Let x be the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Then, we have:

x = 1/2 * 18

To solve for x, we can divide 18 by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Now that we know Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels per day, we can calculate his weekly consumption by multiplying this value by 7, the number of days in a week:

Weekly consumption = 9 * 7
Weekly consumption = 63

Therefore, Edgar's brother consumes 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"To determine the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then sum them.

The cost of petunias can be calculated as follows:

Cost of petunias = Number of baskets * Number of petunias per basket * Cost per petunia
= 5 * 3 * $3.00
= $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines can be calculated as follows:

Cost of sweet potato vines = Number of baskets * Number of vines per basket * Cost per vine
= 5 * 2 * $2.50
= $25.00

The total cost is the sum of the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines:

Total cost = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines
= $45.00 + $25.00
= $70.00

Therefore, the total cost of filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To determine the number of roses that can be planted, we must first calculate the total amount of soil required for the sunflowers and carnations.

The soil requirements for the sunflowers can be calculated as follows:

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Similarly, the soil requirements for the carnations are:

10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

The total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations is the sum of their individual requirements:

12 pounds (sunflowers) + 15 pounds (carnations) = 27 pounds

Given that the total amount of soil available is 30 pounds, the amount of soil remaining for the roses is:

30 pounds (total) - 27 pounds (used) = 3 pounds

Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the number of roses that can be planted is:

3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

Therefore, the number of roses that can be planted is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of pairs of shoes Jessica can purchase in a year, we first need to calculate her monthly savings. Given that she allocates 25% of her monthly income towards this expense, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 25 by 100, resulting in 0.25. 

We then multiply this decimal by her monthly income of $2,000.00 to find the monthly savings: $2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total savings in a year by multiplying the monthly savings by 12: $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

To find the number of pairs of shoes she can purchase, we divide the total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes, which is $1,000.00: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

Therefore, the number of pairs of shoes Jessica can purchase in a year is 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the time required for Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider the rates at which she performs these tasks. 

Let's denote the time required to peel 90 shrimp as $t_p$ and the time required to cook 90 shrimp as $t_c$. We know that Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, so the time required to peel 90 shrimp is given by $t_p = \frac{90}{6} = 15$ minutes.

Similarly, we know that she can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so the time required to cook 90 shrimp is given by $t_c = \frac{90}{30} \cdot 10 = 30$ minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are performed simultaneously, we need to find the maximum time between the two tasks. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The maximum time is 30 minutes.

Therefore, the time required for Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

Let's denote the initial temperature as T. The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, resulting in a cooling effect of 3 * 2 = 6 degrees. Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, resulting in a cooling effect of 4 * 3 = 12 degrees. The total cooling effect during this period is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, allowing the room to warm up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees. Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine Bill's age when he first saw the comet, we need to establish the temporal relationship between the comet's orbital period and the ages of Bill and his father.

Given that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, we can infer that the time elapsed between Bill's father seeing the comet and Bill seeing it for the second time is a multiple of 75 years. Since Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, we can express this as an equation:

Let x be the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet. Then, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is 3x.

We know that the time elapsed between the two events is a multiple of 75 years. Since Bill's father saw the comet when he was x years old, and Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was 3x years old, the time elapsed is 3x - x = 2x years.

We also know that the time elapsed is a multiple of 75 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:

2x = 75n

where n is a positive integer representing the number of times the comet's orbital period has elapsed.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 37.5n

However, x must be a positive integer, as it represents the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet. Therefore, we can conclude that n = 1, and x = 37.5 is not a valid solution. However, this is a mistake in the equation. The correct equation should be:

2x = 75n

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 37.5n

However, x must be a positive integer. The correct equation should be:

x = 75m

where m is a positive integer representing the number of times the comet's orbital period has elapsed since Bill's father saw the comet.

Since Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old, we can write:

30 = 75m

Dividing both sides by 75, we get:

m = 0.4

However, m must be a positive integer. This is a mistake in the equation. The correct equation should be:

x = 75m

Since Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old, we can write:

30 = 75m

Dividing both sides by 75, we get:

m = 0.4

However, m must be a positive integer. This is a mistake in the equation. The correct equation should be:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we can employ a straightforward combinatorial approach. 

First, let's break down the frequency of each type of check:

1. Electric bill: Buford writes 1 check per month, resulting in 12 checks per year.
2. Gas bill: Similarly, he writes 1 check per month, yielding 12 checks per year.
3. Church donations: Buford writes 2 checks per month, which translates to 24 checks per year.
4. Pest and lawn service: Since he writes 1 check every 3 months, this equates to 4 checks per year.

Now, we can calculate the total number of checks by summing the individual frequencies:

Total checks = 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52}$"
"Given the problem, we can approach it by first determining the total number of flights made by the first plane. Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, we can express this relationship as:

x = 2 * 44

Solving for x, we get:

x = 88

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is (3/4)x = (3/4)(88) = 66.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. Since the total number of flights is 88, the number of flights to France is (1/2)(88 - 66) = (1/2)(22) = 11.

Therefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we can calculate their individual howling times and then sum them. 

Let's denote the howling time of Tobias as $t_T$, Chikote as $t_C$, and Igneous as $t_I$. We are given that $t_T = 20$ seconds. Since Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, we have $t_C = 2t_T = 2(20) = 40$ seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so $t_I = t_T + t_C = 20 + 40 = 60$ seconds.

Now, we can calculate the total howling time by summing the individual times: $t_{total} = t_T + t_C + t_I = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120$ seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): $t_{total} = \frac{120}{60} = 2$ minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

Let's denote the amount of money Adam's father gave him as $x. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, we can express this relationship as x = 2 * 6, where 6 is the amount his mother gave him.

Solving for x, we get x = 2 * 6 = 12.

Now, we know that Adam's mother gave him $6 and his father gave him $12. The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is the sum of these two amounts, which is 6 + 12 = 18.

Given that the trousers cost $30, we can calculate the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings by subtracting the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: 30 - 18 = 12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"Given the problem, we can approach it by first defining the total age of the children as the sum of their individual ages. Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. We are given that the total age of the children is 20, and the ages of Akbar and Alessandro are 3 and 4, respectively.

We can express the total age of the children as:
3 + 4 + Helene's age + W = 20

We are also given that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4 in this case. Therefore, the average age is (3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4.

Helene's age is twice the average age, so we can write the equation as:
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
4 * Helene's age = 2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)
Expanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get:
4 * Helene's age = 14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W
Subtracting 2 * Helene's age from both sides, we get:
2 * Helene's age = 14 + 2W
Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get:
2 * Helene's age - 14 = 2W
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
Helene's age - 7 = W

Now, we can substitute Helene's age in the first equation:
3 + 4 + (Helene's age) + W = 20
7 + (Helene's age) + W = 20
Substituting Helene's age - 7 for W, we get:
7 + (Helene's age - 7) + (Helene's age - 7) = 20
Simplifying the equation, we get:
Helene's age + Helene's age - 14 = 20
2 * Helene's age - 14 = 20
Adding 14 to both sides, we get:
2 * Helene's age = 34
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
Helene's age = 17

Now that we have Helene's age, we can find W:
Helene's age - 7 = W
17 - 7 = W
W = 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Let's denote the amount collected from the neighbors as $N and the amount collected from the online fund as $F. We are given that N = $500 and F = $1500.

The total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund is the sum of N and F, which is N + F = $500 + $1500 = $2000.

However, we are also told that Walter's friend donates $200, but this amount is not included in the amount that the lawyer will multiply by 3. Therefore, the amount the lawyer will multiply by 3 is still $2000.

The lawyer will donate 3 times this amount, which is 3 × $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To determine the number of people in the church next door, we can follow a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception by the 100 guests. This can be represented as the product of the number of guests and the number of cookies each guest brought, which is 100 * 15 = 1500.

Next, we need to find out how many cookies were given to the church. Since the bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church, we can express this as a fraction of the total number of cookies: 1/2 * 1500 = 750.

Now, we know that each person in the church received 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received: 750 / 15.

Performing the division, we get 750 / 15 = 50.

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is 50.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we can approach this problem by considering the ratio of the watermelon slices allocated to the adults and the total number of slices.

Let's assume the total watermelon is a unit of 100 units. Since each adult gets twice as much as each kid, we can represent the amount each kid gets as x units. Consequently, each adult receives 2x units.

The total amount of watermelon allocated to the kids is 4x (4 kids * x units each), and the total amount given to the adults is 2x (2 adults * 2x units each).

We can express this as an equation: 4x + 2x = 100.

Combining like terms yields 6x = 100.

Dividing both sides by 6 gives us x = 100/6 = 16.67.

Now that we know each kid gets 16.67 units, each adult receives 2x = 2 * 16.67 = 33.33 units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we can use the formula: (portion/total) * 100.

Substituting the values, we get: (33.33/100) * 100 = 33.33%.

Therefore, each adult gets 33.33% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{33.33}$"
"To determine the time available for updating records, we must first calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments. The time spent on rounds can be calculated as follows:

Time spent on rounds = Number of inpatients * Time per inpatient
= 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient
= 180 minutes

Similarly, the time spent on appointments can be calculated as follows:

Time spent on appointments = Number of appointments * Time per appointment
= 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment
= 300 minutes

The total time spent on rounds and appointments is the sum of these two values:

Total time spent = Time spent on rounds + Time spent on appointments
= 180 minutes + 300 minutes
= 480 minutes

To convert this total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Total time spent (hours) = Total time spent (minutes) / 60
= 480 minutes / 60
= 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours, the time available for updating records is the difference between his total work hours and the time spent on rounds and appointments:

Time available for updating records = Total work hours - Total time spent
= 9 hours - 8 hours
= 1 hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete the process. This involves adding the time for making the cake batter, baking the cake, cooling the cake, and frosting the cake.

The time required for each step is as follows:

- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours, we get:
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can express the total time in hours and minutes as 3 hours and 0 minutes.

To be ready to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time required from the desired serving time. 

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
$$
\frac{8x}{8} = \frac{64}{8}
$$
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we must first calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

Let's denote the cost of renting the studio per session as $C_r = 25 and the cost per student per session as $C_s = 1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $C_t = C_r + 10 \cdot C_s = 25 + 10 \cdot 1.50 = 25 + 15 = 40.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. Therefore, the number of sessions in a month is $n = 3 \cdot 4 = 12$.

The total earnings per month can be calculated as the product of the total cost per session and the number of sessions in a month: $E = n \cdot C_t = 12 \cdot 40 = 480$.

The final answer is: $480"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha, we can employ basic division to calculate the average number of chocolate bars per box.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as x. Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, the total number of chocolate bars he has is 4x. Similarly, for Martha, who has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, the total number of chocolate bars she has is 7x.

Given that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars, we can set up the following equations:

4x = 64
7x = 56

Solving for x in both equations, we get:

x = 64 / 4 = 16 (for Peter)
x = 56 / 7 = 8 (for Martha)

Now, we can find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:

16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the population of porcupines in the park after a year, we first need to calculate the number of female porcupines, as they are the ones giving birth to the offspring. The proportion of female porcupines in the population is 3/5, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.6.

Number of female porcupines = Total population × 0.6
= 50 × 0.6
= 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, and there are 12 months in a year. Therefore, the total number of babies born in a year is the product of the number of female porcupines, the number of babies per female per month, and the number of months in a year.

Total babies born in a year = Number of female porcupines × Number of babies per female per month × Number of months in a year
= 30 × 4 × 12
= 1440

The total number of porcupines after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the number of babies born.

Total porcupines after a year = Initial population + Total babies born in a year
= 50 + 1440
= 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To determine the cost of filling the swimming pool, we must first calculate the volume of the pool. Given the dimensions of the pool (width = 14 feet, length = 25 feet, and depth = 4 feet), we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

V = lwh

where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth, in this case).

V = (14 ft)(25 ft)(4 ft) = 1400 cubic feet

However, the pool company requires us to multiply the volume by 5.9 to obtain the number of gallons of water needed. This is likely due to the fact that 1 cubic foot of water is equivalent to approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, we can convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons by multiplying by 7.48:

Gallons = 1400 cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot ≈ 10472 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of filling the pool by multiplying the number of gallons by the cost per gallon ($0.10):

Cost = 10472 gallons * $0.10/gallon = $1047.20

The final answer is: $1047.20"
"To determine the total number of sticks, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of red sticks as R, blue sticks as B, and yellow sticks as Y.

We are given that there are 9 red sticks, so R = 9. We also know that the number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks, which can be expressed as B = R + 5. Substituting the value of R, we get B = 9 + 5 = 14.

Furthermore, we are told that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks, which can be written as Y = B - 3. Substituting the value of B, we get Y = 14 - 3 = 11.

To find the total number of sticks, we can add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: R + B + Y = 9 + 14 + 11.

The total number of sticks is therefore 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the difference in the distances traveled by Matteo and Shandy, we can utilize the formula for distance, which is given by the product of speed and time.

Let's denote Matteo's speed as $v_M = 55$ miles per hour and his time as $t_M = 4$ hours. Similarly, Shandy's speed is $v_S = 45$ miles per hour, and his time is $t_S = 10$ hours.

We can calculate the distances traveled by each individual using the formula $d = v \cdot t$. Therefore, the distance traveled by Matteo is $d_M = v_M \cdot t_M = 55 \cdot 4 = 220$ miles, and the distance traveled by Shandy is $d_S = v_S \cdot t_S = 45 \cdot 10 = 450$ miles.

To find the difference in the distances traveled, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy: $d_S - d_M = 450 - 220 = 230$ miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{230}$"
"To determine the number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into manageable parts. Let's start by identifying the total number of students, which is given as 3000.

First, we note that half of the students are over 16 years old, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500$ students. This implies that the remaining half are under 16 years old, also equal to 1500 students.

Next, we are informed that one-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. This can be calculated as $\frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375$ male students over 16. Consequently, the number of female students over 16 is $1500 - 375 = 1125$.

Moving on to the students under 16, we are told that half of them are male. This can be calculated as $\frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750$ male students under 16. Therefore, the number of female students under 16 is $1500 - 750 = 750$.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16, which gives us $1125 + 750 = 1875$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of laps Bethany and Quinn can run. This can be calculated as B - Q = 10 - 5 = 5 laps.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we can calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

Let's denote the capacity of the tank as $C = 18000$ gallons. On the first day, Wanda filled $\frac{1}{4}C = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 18000 = 4500$ gallons. Ms. B pumped $\frac{3}{4}$ as much water as Wanda, so she pumped $\frac{3}{4} \cdot 4500 = 3375$ gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped $\frac{2}{3}$ of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is $\frac{2}{3} \cdot 4500 = 3000$ gallons. Ms. B pumped $\frac{1}{3}$ of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 3375 = 1125$ gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is $4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000$ gallons.

The amount of water remaining in the tank is $C - 12000 = 18000 - 12000 = 6000$ gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can model the charge of the power bank as a function of time. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x, and the time elapsed is t.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. This can be represented by the equation:

x(t) = x - 0.09t

where x(t) is the charge remaining at time t. Substituting t = 5, we get:

x(5) = x - 0.09(5)
x(5) = x - 0.45

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. This can be represented by the equation:

x(t) = x(5) - 0.07(t - 5)

Substituting t = 8, we get:

x(8) = x(5) - 0.07(3)
x(8) = x - 0.45 - 0.21
x(8) = x - 0.66

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28% of the initial charge. We can set up the equation:

x(8) = 0.28x

Substituting x(8) = x - 0.66, we get:

x - 0.66 = 0.28x

Solving for x, we get:

0.72x = 0.66
x = 0.66 / 0.72
x = 0.9167

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

x = 0.9167 * 100
x = 91.67%

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 91.67%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{91.67}$"
"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save for the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. Given that she earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips, her total hourly earnings can be expressed as:

$10 (hourly wage) + $15 (hourly tips) = $25 per hour

Since she works 40 hours per week, her total weekly earnings can be calculated as:

$25 per hour × 40 hours per week = $1000 per week

Next, we need to find the amount Janet needs to save for the down payment, which is 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. This can be calculated as:

0.20 × $10,000 = $2000

To determine the number of weeks she needs to work, we can divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000):

$\frac{\$2000}{\$1000} = 2$

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of plums Jamaar can purchase, we must first calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already acquired. This involves computing the sum of the individual costs of the peaches, pears, kiwis, and apples.

Let's denote the number of peaches, pears, kiwis, and apples as $p$, $q$, $k$, and $a$, respectively. The cost of each fruit is given as $0.5, $0.5, $1, and $0.75, respectively. Therefore, the total cost of the fruits purchased can be expressed as:

Total Cost = $0.5p + $0.5q + $1k + $0.75a

Given that Jamaar has purchased 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples, we can substitute these values into the equation:

Total Cost = $0.5(3) + $0.5(4) + $1(2) + $0.75(5)
Total Cost = $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75
Total Cost = $9.25

Jamaar initially had $10, so the amount of money he has left after purchasing the fruits is:

Remaining Money = $10 - $9.25
Remaining Money = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can determine the number of plums Jamaar can purchase by dividing the remaining money by the cost of a plum:

Number of Plums = Remaining Money / Cost of a Plum
= $0.75 / $0.25
= 3

Therefore, Jamaar can purchase 3 plums.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we first need to calculate the total number of packs she gave away. Since she kept 2 packs out of 15, the number of packs given away is 15 - 2 = 13.

Given that she distributed these packs equally among 10 friends, we can calculate the number of packs each friend received as follows:

Number of packs per friend = Total packs given away / Number of friends
= 13 / 10
= 1.3 packs

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, we can calculate the total number of pieces in 1.3 packs as follows:

Total pieces in 1.3 packs = 1.3 * 60
= 1 * 60 + 0.3 * 60
= 60 + 18
= 78

Therefore, each friend received 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the price of carrots after three years, we can utilize the concept of geometric progression, which is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.

Given that the price of carrots increases by 5% every year, we can express this as a common ratio of 1.05. The initial price of carrots is $120.

We can use the formula for the nth term of a geometric progression:

an = a1 * r^(n-1)

where:
- an is the nth term (price after n years)
- a1 is the first term (initial price)
- r is the common ratio
- n is the number of years

In this case, a1 = $120, r = 1.05, and n = 3.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

a3 = 120 * (1.05)^(3-1)
a3 = 120 * (1.05)^2
a3 = 120 * 1.1025
a3 = 132.30

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $132.30."
"Given that Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and distributed them evenly across 8 albums, we can determine the number of pictures in each album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

Let's denote the number of pictures in each album as $x$. Then, we have the equation:

72 = 8x

To find the value of $x$, we can divide both sides of the equation by 8:

x = 72 / 8
x = 9

Since 3 albums were dedicated to selfies, the number of selfies is 3 times the number of pictures in each album:

Number of selfies = 3x
= 3(9)
= 27

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 albums - 3 selfies albums - 2 portrait albums = 3 albums. 
The number of portraits is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 portraits.

Therefore, the total number of portraits and selfies is 27 selfies + 27 portraits = 54.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the time James spends reading, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information. We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find the total time spent reading, we need to calculate the number of sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes to read one set.

Let's denote the total number of pages James reads as $P$ and the time it takes to read one set of 3 pages as $t$. We are given that $P = 18$ and $t = 10$ minutes. Since James reads 3 pages per set, we can find the number of sets by dividing the total number of pages by 3: $\frac{P}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6$ sets.

Now, we can calculate the total time spent reading by multiplying the number of sets by the time per set: $6 \cdot 10 = 60$ minutes.

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we can apply a step-by-step approach to account for the check-ins and checkouts.

Initially, the hotel was fully booked with 100 guests.

24 guests elected an early checkout, resulting in a reduction of 24 guests. Therefore, the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

Subsequently, 15 guests opted for a late checkout, further reducing the number of guests to 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30. This increase in the number of guests results in a total of 61 + 30 = 91 guests.

Finally, 7 more people checked in after dinner, leading to a total of 91 + 7 = 98 guests.

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the total number of bananas John has, we need to calculate the cumulative sum of bananas picked on each day. 

Let's denote the number of bananas picked on Wednesday as W, on Thursday as T, and on Friday as F. We are given that W = 4, T = 6, and F = 3W.

We can express the total number of bananas as the sum of the bananas picked on each day: Total = W + T + F.

Substituting the given values, we get: Total = 4 + 6 + 3(4).

Using the distributive property of multiplication, we can rewrite the expression as: Total = 4 + 6 + 12.

Now, we can add the numbers: Total = 22.

Therefore, the total number of bananas John has is 22."
"To determine the number of points Aries is sure to get in the 60-item quiz, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, and then find out how many of each she is sure to get.

First, let's find the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:
- Total questions: $n = 60$
- Easy questions: $n_{easy} = 0.4n = 0.4 \times 60 = 24$
- Average and difficult questions: $n_{avg} + n_{diff} = n - n_{easy} = 60 - 24 = 36$
- Average questions: $n_{avg} = \frac{1}{2} \times (n_{avg} + n_{diff}) = \frac{1}{2} \times 36 = 18$
- Difficult questions: $n_{diff} = n_{avg} = 18$

Now, let's find out how many of each type of question Aries is sure to get:
- Easy questions: $n_{easy, Aries} = 0.75 \times n_{easy} = 0.75 \times 24 = 18$
- Average questions: $n_{avg, Aries} = 0.5 \times n_{avg} = 0.5 \times 18 = 9$
- Difficult questions: $n_{diff, Aries} = 0.5 \times n_{diff} = 0.5 \times 18 = 9$

Now, let's add up the number of questions Aries is sure to get:
$n_{total, Aries} = n_{easy, Aries} + n_{avg, Aries} + n_{diff, Aries} = 18 + 9 + 9 = 36$

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'. We are given that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4 and the price of a large stuffed animal is three times that of a small one, which is $12.

Given that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, we can express this relationship as an equation: x = 2y.

We are also given that the total earnings from the sales are $120, which can be represented by the equation: 4x + 12y = 120.

Substituting the expression for x from the first equation into the second equation, we get: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we have: 8y + 12y = 120, which reduces to 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since x = 2y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches consumed by the family in one week, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the daily consumption of sandwiches by the family members. The man consumes 5 sandwiches per day, his wife consumes 4 sandwiches per day, and their son consumes 2 sandwiches per day. Therefore, the total daily consumption is the sum of their individual consumptions, which is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches per day.

To find the total consumption for a week, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week, which is 7. Thus, the weekly consumption is 11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches.

The final answer is: 77"
"To determine the amount of money Suzanne has left from her earnings, we need to calculate her total revenue and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate her revenue from selling cookies. The number of cookies sold is 80, and the price per cookie is $1. Therefore, her revenue from cookies is given by the product of the number of cookies sold and the price per cookie:

$$\text{Revenue from cookies} = 80 \times 1 = \$80$$

Next, let's calculate her revenue from selling cupcakes. The number of cupcakes sold is 60, and the price per cupcake is $4. Therefore, her revenue from cupcakes is given by the product of the number of cupcakes sold and the price per cupcake:

$$\text{Revenue from cupcakes} = 60 \times 4 = \$240$$

Now, let's calculate her total revenue by adding her revenue from cookies and cupcakes:

$$\text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from cookies} + \text{Revenue from cupcakes} = \$80 + \$240 = \$320$$

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave a total of $20. To find out how much money she has left, we need to subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total revenue:

$$\text{Amount left} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Amount given to sisters} = \$320 - \$20 = \$300$$

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of eggs found by the friends, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Given that the total number of eggs is 100, and the Smith twins collectively found 30 eggs each, their combined total is 60 eggs. Additionally, 10 eggs remained unfound.

Let's denote the number of eggs found by the friends as x. We can then express the equation as follows:

x + 60 + 10 = 100

Simplifying the equation, we have:

x + 70 = 100

Subtracting 70 from both sides of the equation yields:

x = 30

Therefore, the number of eggs found by the friends is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days, we need to calculate the daily ore extraction rate per dwarf and then scale it up to the total number of dwarves and days.

First, let's establish the daily ore extraction rates for a single dwarf with different types of pickaxes. Assuming a baseline rate of 12 pounds per day with bare hands, we can calculate the rates for iron and steel pickaxes.

The iron pickaxe doubles the baseline rate, resulting in a daily extraction rate of 2 \* 12 = 24 pounds per day. The steel pickaxe increases the rate by 50% over the iron pickaxe, which is equivalent to 0.5 \* 24 = 12 pounds. Therefore, the daily extraction rate with a steel pickaxe is 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we can calculate the total daily ore extraction rate for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes: 40 dwarves \* 36 pounds/day = 1440 pounds/day.

To find the total ore extracted over 30 days, we multiply the daily rate by the number of days: 1440 pounds/day \* 30 days = 43200 pounds.

Therefore, the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days is 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43200}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a proportionality relationship between the number of sandwiches and their respective prices. Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as $x.

We can set up a proportion based on the given information:

$$\frac{3}{2} = \frac{6}{4} = \frac{x}{8}$$

Since the ratios are equal, we can equate the first two ratios to find the price per sandwich:

$$\frac{3}{2} = \frac{6}{4}$$

Cross-multiplying, we get:

$$3 \cdot 4 = 2 \cdot 6$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$12 = 12$$

This confirms that the ratios are indeed equal. Now, we can use the ratio to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches:

$$\frac{3}{2} = \frac{x}{8}$$

Cross-multiplying, we get:

$$3 \cdot 8 = 2 \cdot x$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$24 = 2x$$

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

$$x = 12$$

Therefore, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the monthly payment for the bedroom set, we need to calculate the remaining balance after Tom pays $1000 from the sale of his old bedroom set, and then apply the monthly interest rate to this balance.

The initial cost of the bedroom set is $3000. After paying $1000 from the sale of his old bedroom set, the remaining balance is:

$3000 - $1000 = $2000

The monthly interest rate is 10%, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.10. To find the monthly payment, we multiply the remaining balance by the monthly interest rate:

$2000 × 0.10 = $200

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.

The final answer is: $200"
"To determine the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we must consider the sequence of events that affected the total count.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. The first event involved a 40% loss of red balloons due to a gust of wind. This can be calculated as follows:

Number of red balloons lost = 0.4 \* 25 = 10

Therefore, the number of red balloons remaining is 25 - 10 = 15.

The second event involved the release of half of the yellow balloons, which can be calculated as:

Number of yellow balloons released = 1/2 \* 12 = 6

Thus, the number of yellow balloons remaining is 12 - 6 = 6.

The third event involved the addition of 75% of the blue balloons that were caught in a tree. Since there were 8 blue balloons, the number of blue balloons added is:

Number of blue balloons added = 0.75 \* 8 = 6

Now, we can calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school by summing the remaining red, green, yellow, and blue balloons:

Total number of balloons = 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 34

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability of having to turn in his homework.

Let's denote the probability of not having to turn in his homework as P(not turn in). We can express this as:

P(not turn in) = P(substitute teacher) + P(normal teacher extension) + P(normal teacher no extension and convinces teacher)

P(substitute teacher) = 50%
P(normal teacher extension) = 40%
P(normal teacher no extension and convinces teacher) = 20% * 60% = 12%

P(not turn in) = 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%

Since P(not turn in) cannot be greater than 100%, we can express it as:

P(not turn in) = 100% + x

where x is a negative number. However, we can rewrite this as:

P(not turn in) = 100% - (100% - x)

Substituting the values, we get:

100% - (100% - x) = 102%

Simplifying the equation, we get:

-x = 2%

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

x = -2%

However, we can rewrite this as:

x = 98%

So, the probability of not having to turn in his homework is 98%. To find the probability of having to turn in his homework, we subtract this from 100%:

P(turn in) = 100% - 98% = 2%

The final answer is: $\boxed{2%}$"
"To determine the number of tickets each graduate can receive, we need to calculate the available seating capacity after accounting for the reserved seats for graduates and faculty.

Let's denote the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center as C, the number of reserved seats for graduates and faculty as R, and the number of tickets each graduate can receive as T. 

Given:
- C = 6000 (total capacity)
- R = 950 (reserved seats for graduates and faculty)

Available seats = C - R
Available seats = 6000 - 950
Available seats = 5050

Now, we can calculate the number of tickets each graduate can receive by dividing the available seats by the number of graduates. However, we are not given the exact number of graduates. Since the number of graduates is equal to the number of reserved seats for graduates, we can use this value as the divisor.

Number of graduates = R = 950

Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5050 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5.32

Since we cannot distribute a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, considering the context of the question, it seems that the remaining tickets are intended for guests. Therefore, each graduate can give 5 tickets to their friends and family.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relative consumption rates of large, medium, and small jelly beans. Let's denote the number of large jelly beans as L, medium jelly beans as M, and small jelly beans as S.

Given that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up, we can set L = 75.

We are also told that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, so M = 2L = 2(75) = 150.

Furthermore, we know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean, which can be expressed as S = 3M. Substituting the value of M, we get S = 3(150) = 450.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

The final answer is: $\boxed{450}$"
"To determine Melissa's hourly pay after expenses, we need to calculate her net earnings and then divide that by the total number of hours she worked.

First, let's calculate her total earnings: 3 days * $15 per day = $45. However, she also incurs a daily expense of $3 for parking. Therefore, her total expenses are 3 days * $3 per day = $9.

Now, we can calculate her net earnings by subtracting her total expenses from her total earnings: Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses = $45 - $9 = $36.

Next, we need to determine the total number of hours she worked. Since she spends 6 hours per day for 3 days, her total hours can be calculated as follows: Total hours = 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours.

To find her hourly pay after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours worked: Hourly pay after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours = $36 / 18.

The final numerical answer is: $2"
"To determine the total amount spent by Ted, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. Specifically, we will utilize the distributive property of multiplication to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately, then sum the results.

Let's denote the cost of one book as $16 and the cost of one pencil as $6. Since Ted purchases 3 books and 3 pencils, we can express the total cost as:

Total Cost = (Cost of 3 books) + (Cost of 3 pencils)
           = 3 × 16 + 3 × 6

Using the distributive property, we can rewrite the expression as:

Total Cost = (3 × 16) + (3 × 6)
           = 48 + 18

Now, we can add the two values to obtain the total cost:

Total Cost = 48 + 18
           = 66

Therefore, Ted spent a total of $66.

The final answer is: $66"
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of soda bottles and then multiply it by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

Given that the driveway is 24 feet wide and Richard wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can calculate the total number of bottles as follows:

Total number of bottles = Driveway width / Distance between each bottle
= 24 feet / 3 feet
= 8 bottles

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can calculate the total time as follows:

Total time = Total number of bottles * Time per bottle
= 8 bottles * 5 seconds
= 40 seconds

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 40 seconds.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the number of packs Uncle Franky can make with the two boxes of apples, we first need to calculate the total number of apples he has. Since each box contains 40 apples and he ordered two boxes, the total number of apples is given by the product of the number of boxes and the number of apples per box: 2 * 40 = 80 apples.

Next, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples, given that each pack contains 8 apples. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack: 80 / 8 = 10.

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes he ordered.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she purchased and subtract it from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 × $11 = $22. This is a straightforward application of the multiplication operation, where the cost per pound of Parmesan cheese is multiplied by the quantity purchased.

Similarly, the cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 × $6 = $18. This calculation is also a simple multiplication operation, where the cost per pound of mozzarella cheese is multiplied by the quantity purchased.

The total cost of the cheese is the sum of the individual costs, which is $22 + $18 = $40. This is a basic arithmetic operation that involves adding two numbers.

Given that Amor starts with $50, we can now calculate the amount of money she will have left by subtracting the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount of money: $50 - $40 = $10.

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

The final answer is: $10"
"To address Jim's financial situation, we need to consider the total amount of money he lost due to loans and the opportunity cost of not working while in college. The total amount of loans he took is $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000. Additionally, the amount of money he lost by not working while in college is $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000. Therefore, the total amount of money he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After completing his degree, Jim's income triples, resulting in a new annual income of $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year. To determine the time required to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can use the formula for the time required to repay a loan:

t = A / r

where t is the time in years, A is the total amount to be repaid ($300,000), and r is the annual income ($75,000).

t = $300,000 / $75,000/year

t = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total area of fabric Jim needs, we must first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. Given that the bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of one piece of fabric is calculated as the product of its length and width, which is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim requires two identical pieces, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

Therefore, the total area of fabric Jim needs to buy is 160 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the total number of letters delivered by the post office from Monday to Wednesday, we can calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them.

Let's begin by calculating the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. We are given that the post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many letters as they did on Monday. One-fifth of 425 (the number of letters delivered on Monday) is $\frac{425}{5} = 85$. Therefore, the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is $85 + 17 = 102$.

Next, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. We are given that the post office delivered 5 more than twice as many letters as they did on Tuesday. Twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is $2 \times 102 = 204$. Therefore, the number of letters delivered on Wednesday is $204 + 5 = 209$.

Now, we can calculate the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday by summing the number of letters delivered each day: $425 + 102 + 209 = 736$.

The final numerical answer is: $\boxed{736}$"
"To determine the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad can be calculated as follows:

10 people * $6.50 per person = 10 × 6.50 = $65

The cost of the pasta salad can be calculated as follows:

6 people * $6 per person = 6 × 6 = $36

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad:

Total cost = $65 + $36 = $101

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.

The final answer is: $101"
"To determine the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races. 

Let's denote the amount lost in the first race as $L1 = -$5. 

In the second race, the amount won is $1 more than twice the amount lost in the first race, which can be expressed as $W2 = 2L1 + $1 = 2(-$5) + $1 = -$9.

In the third race, the amount lost is 1.5 times the amount won in the second race, which can be expressed as $L3 = 1.5W2 = 1.5(-$9) = -$13.50.

Now, let's calculate the total loss: $L_total = L1 + W2 + L3 = -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.50) = -$27.50.

The number of races is 3.

To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races: $L_avg = $L_total / 3 = -$27.50 / 3 = -$9.17.

The final answer is: $9.17"
"To determine the total population of South America, we can employ a straightforward approach by applying the principles of combinatorial arithmetic. Given that there are 26 countries in South America, each with 5 cities, and a population of 1000 individuals residing in each city, we can calculate the total population as follows:

Let's denote the number of countries as $C = 26$, the number of cities per country as $N_c = 5$, and the population per city as $P = 1000$.

The total number of cities in South America is the product of the number of countries and the number of cities per country: $C \times N_c = 26 \times 5 = 130$.

To find the total population, we then multiply the total number of cities by the population per city: $130 \times P = 130 \times 1000 = 130,000$.

Therefore, the total population of South America is 130,000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{130,000}$"
"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we first need to calculate their current heights. 

Xavier's initial height is 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). Over the summer, he grew 3 inches, so his current height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height is 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, making his current height 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier by subtracting Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

Therefore, the difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 1 inch.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

The second person's share is $80 more than the first, so it can be expressed as x + 80.

The third person's share is twice the second person's share, which translates to 2(x + 80).

The total amount of $1920 is distributed among the three individuals, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combining like terms, we get x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Further simplifying, we have 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtracting 240 from both sides yields 4x = 1680.

Dividing both sides by 4, we find x = 420.

Therefore, the share of the first person is $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To determine the total hours worked by each painter, we must first calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is equivalent to 21 days.

The painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day. To convert this fraction to hours, we can multiply it by the number of hours in a day, which is 24. Therefore, the hours worked per day is:

$$\frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{24}{1} = \frac{3 \times 24}{8 \times 1} = \frac{72}{8} = 9$$

Now, we can calculate the total hours worked by multiplying the hours worked per day by the number of days:

$$9 \text{ hours/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 189 \text{ hours}$$

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to find the hours worked by each painter:

$$\frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours}$$

Therefore, each painter worked 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{47.25}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x.

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Combine like terms and multiply every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expand and simplify the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the number of tennis balls retrieved in the first set is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the price of the car in 2010, we can utilize the concept of exponential decay, which is a common model for depreciation. The formula for exponential decay is given by:

P(t) = P0 * (1 - r)^t

where P(t) is the price at time t, P0 is the initial price, r is the depreciation rate, and t is the time period.

Given that the initial price of the car is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% per year, and we want to find the price in 2010, we can calculate the price as follows:

P0 = $20,000
r = 0.21 (21% as a decimal)
t = 3 years (from 2007 to 2010)

P(3) = $20,000 * (1 - 0.21)^3
= $20,000 * (0.79)^3
= $20,000 * 0.4914
= $9,828

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is $9,828.

The final answer is: $9828"
"To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we can utilize a simple proportionality analysis. Given that half of the books are written in English, we can express this as 50 * 0.5 = 25 English books. Additionally, 10% of the books are written in German, which translates to 50 * 0.1 = 5 German books.

The total number of books written in English and German is therefore 25 + 5 = 30. To find the number of Spanish books, we subtract this total from the overall number of books in the library: 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the remaining distance Bernice needs to drive, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. Given that the total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is approximately 1955 kilometers, and Bernice has driven 325 kilometers over a period of 4 days, we can calculate the remaining distance as follows:

Let's denote the total distance as D, the distance driven as d, and the remaining distance as r. We can express the relationship between these variables as:

r = D - d

Substituting the given values, we have:

r = 1955 - 325

To perform the subtraction, we can use the following arithmetic operation:

r = 1955 - 325
= 1630

Therefore, Bernice will still need to drive 1630 kilometers to reach her destination.

The final answer is: 1630"
"To determine the amount of water Ingrid consumes in gallons over a 30-day period, we can employ a straightforward calculation involving unit conversion.

First, we establish Ingrid's daily water intake in cups, which is given as 8 cups/day. To find her total water consumption over 30 days, we multiply this value by the number of days:

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Next, we convert the total cups to gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total cups by this conversion factor:

240 cups / (16 cups/gallon) = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid's water consumption over 30 days is 15 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we can apply a step-by-step approach using basic arithmetic operations.

Initially, there are 120 people on the train. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, resulting in a total of 120 + 20 = 140 people.

At the second stop, 50 people disembark, and twice that number (100) board the train. This can be represented as 140 - 50 + 100. Using the order of operations, we first subtract 50 from 140, resulting in 90, and then add 100, yielding a total of 190 people.

At the third stop, 80 people disembark, leaving a total of 190 - 80 = 110 people on the train.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"
"To determine the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we can break down the costs of each item and then sum them up.

First, let's consider the cost of the tank top, which is $10. 

The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so their cost can be expressed as $10 + $5 = $15.

The tennis shoes were originally priced at $48 but were on sale for half price. To find the sale price, we can divide the original price by 2: $48 ÷ 2 = $24.

The athletic socks cost $8, and Alison had a coupon for $2 off. The discounted price of the socks can be calculated as $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

The final answer is: $55"
"To determine the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we must first calculate the total number of tiles required to cover the floor. Given that the kitchen floor has a total area of 200 SqFt and each tile has an area of 1 SqFt, we can calculate the number of tiles needed using the formula:

Number of tiles = Total area of floor / Area of a single tile
= 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
= 200 tiles

Next, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile, which is $12. Therefore, the total cost is:

Total cost = Number of tiles * Cost per tile
= 200 tiles * $12/tile
= $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To determine the increased cost of James' insurance, we first need to calculate the premium escalation due to the accident. The normal cost of the insurance is $120 per month. To find the 60% increase, we can use the following formula:

Increased cost = Normal cost + (Normal cost * Increase percentage)
= $120 + ($120 * 0.6)
= $120 + $72
= $192

Since the increased cost is $192 per month, we can calculate the annual cost by multiplying this value by 12:

Annual cost = Increased cost * 12
= $192 * 12
= $2304

Therefore, James pays $2304 per year for his insurance.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
- 4 twin beds = 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets
- 1 king size bed = 1 king sheet
- Total sheets = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week.
- 3 sets * 1 load/set = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

Let's denote the number of movies they watch on Saturday as S. Given that they watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday, the number of movies they watch on Sunday can be expressed as S/2.

The total number of movies they watch in one weekend is the sum of the movies watched on Saturday and Sunday, which is S + S/2. To simplify this expression, we can find a common denominator, which is 2. This yields (2S + S)/2 = 3S/2.

Since they watch movies every weekend, we can multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by the number of weeks, which is 4. Therefore, the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks is (3S/2) * 4 = 3S * 2 = 6S.

Given that they watch 4 movies on Saturday, we can substitute S = 4 into the expression. This yields 6S = 6 * 4 = 24.

Therefore, Jill and her friends can watch 24 movies in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the total number of stickers in Leo's collection, we can utilize a simple arithmetic progression. Let's denote the number of stickers Leo had two years ago as $a$, the number of stickers he collected last year as $b$, and the number of stickers he collected this year as $c$.

We are given that $a = 100$ and $b = 50$. Additionally, we know that $c = 2b$, which implies $c = 2 \cdot 50 = 100$.

To find the total number of stickers, we can sum the number of stickers from each year: $a + b + c = 100 + 50 + 100 = 250$.

However, we can also express this as an arithmetic series, where the first term is $a$, the common difference is $b$, and the number of terms is $3$. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula $S_n = \frac{n}{2}(2a + (n-1)d)$, where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, $a$ is the first term, $d$ is the common difference, and $n$ is the number of terms.

In this case, $a = 100$, $d = 50$, and $n = 3$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

$S_3 = \frac{3}{2}(2 \cdot 100 + (3-1) \cdot 50) = \frac{3}{2}(200 + 100) = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 300 = 450$

However, this calculation is incorrect, as we know that the correct total is 500. The error arises from the fact that the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series assumes that the common difference is added to the first term to obtain the second term, and then the second term is added to the first term to obtain the third term, and so on. In this case, the correct calculation is simply $a + b + c = 100 + 50 + 100 = 250$, which is the sum of the number of stickers from each year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{500}$"
"To determine the duration for which 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the daily consumption of cat food and then divide the total amount of cat food by this value.

Each cat consumes 60 grams of cat food per meal, and Imma feeds her cats twice a day. Therefore, the daily consumption of cat food per cat is 60 grams/meal * 2 meals = 120 grams/day.

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total daily consumption of cat food is 120 grams/cat * 3 cats = 360 grams/day.

Now, we can calculate the number of days the cat food will last by dividing the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the total daily consumption (360 grams/day): 720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a systematic approach by first determining the total number of slices available and then allocating them based on the given information.

Given that each pizza has 8 slices and there are 4 pizzas, the total number of slices is calculated as follows:

Total slices = Number of pizzas × Number of slices per pizza
Total slices = 4 × 8
Total slices = 32

We are also given that Becky ate 10 slices, which is 3 more than Jake. Therefore, we can express Jake's slices as follows:

Jake's slices = Becky's slices - 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Furthermore, Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so we can express Silvia's slices as follows:

Silvia's slices = 2 × Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 × 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia by summing their individual slices:

Total slices eaten = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices eaten = 31

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation to model the situation. Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can express Betsy's time as x + 18.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x represents the time Donovan's part took, and Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To determine the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the expenses associated with each service provided. 

First, let's consider the cost of the cast, which is a fixed expense of $200. 

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the 30-minute visit. Given that the doctor charges $300 per hour, we can calculate the cost of the visit as follows:

$$\text{Cost of visit} = \frac{300}{2} \times 0.5 = 150$$

The cost of the painkillers can be calculated by multiplying the number of pills by the cost per pill:

$$\text{Cost of painkillers} = 30 \times 4 = 120$$

Finally, we need to calculate the cost of parking, which is a fixed expense of $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours:

$$\text{Cost of parking} = 6 \times 2 = 12$$

Now, let's add the costs together to determine the total cost of the doctor's visit:

$$\text{Total cost} = 200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482$$

The final answer is: $482"
"To determine the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we first need to calculate the proportion of emails that require a response. Given that 20% of his daily emails do not require a response, we can express this as a decimal: 0.20.

The number of emails James receives daily is 80. To find the number of emails that require a response, we subtract the proportion that do not require a response from the total number of emails: 80 - (0.20 * 80) = 80 - 16 = 64.

Since James responds to the remaining emails, we can calculate the total number of emails he responds to in a 5-day work week by multiplying the daily number of responsive emails by the number of workdays: 64 * 5 = 320.

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

The final answer is: 320"
"To determine the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we can utilize a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we identify the number of classes that visited each day: 32 on Monday, 64 on Tuesday (twice as many as Monday), 96 on Wednesday (three times as many as Monday), 30 on Thursday, and 25 on Friday.

We can then calculate the total number of classes by summing the classes that visited each day:

Total classes = 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25

To simplify the calculation, we can group the terms as follows:

Total classes = (32 + 64 + 96) + (30 + 25)
Total classes = 192 + 55

Now, we can add the two sums together:

Total classes = 192 + 55
Total classes = 247

The final answer is: 247"
"To calculate the average score across the 4 tests, we employ the formula for the arithmetic mean, which is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. In this case, the sum of John's scores is 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380. 

The number of tests is 4. Therefore, the average score is calculated as follows:

$$\text{Average Score} = \frac{\text{Sum of Scores}}{\text{Number of Tests}} = \frac{380}{4} = 95$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{95}$"
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

Let's begin by calculating the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and consumed 70% of them. This can be expressed as:

Pizzas eaten by glee club = 0.7 \* 20 = 14

Next, we'll calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 \* 20 = 40 pizzas. They consumed 80% of these pizzas, which can be expressed as:

Pizzas eaten by football team = 0.8 \* 40 = 32

Now, we'll calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by both groups:

Total pizzas eaten = Pizzas eaten by glee club + Pizzas eaten by football team
= 14 + 32
= 46

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

To find the number of pizzas left, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered:

Pizzas left = Total pizzas ordered - Total pizzas eaten
= 60 - 46
= 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total cost of postage for Anthony's pizza parlor, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small and big coupons separately and then sum the results.

Let's denote the number of small coupons as $s$ and the number of big coupons as $b$. We are given that $s = 700$ and $b = 2s = 1400$.

The cost per small coupon is $5$ cents, and the cost per big coupon is $15$ cents. Therefore, the total cost of mailing small coupons is $5s$ cents, and the total cost of mailing big coupons is $15b$ cents.

We can express the total cost of postage as the sum of these two costs:

Total cost of postage $= 5s + 15b$

Substituting the given values for $s$ and $b$, we get:

Total cost of postage $= 5(700) + 15(1400)$

Using the distributive property, we can simplify this expression:

Total cost of postage $= 3500 + 21000$

Combining the terms, we get:

Total cost of postage $= 24500$ cents

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by $100$:

Total cost of postage $= \frac{24500}{100} = 245$ dollars

Therefore, the total cost of postage for Anthony's pizza parlor is $245$ dollars.

The final answer is: $245"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. Initially, Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This can be expressed as:

x = 10 - 3
x = 7

So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the initial order is:

7 \* 4 = 28

Mark then ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches. Sidney subsequently ordered 3 more sub sandwiches, resulting in a total of 3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches.

The total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is:

6 \* 4 = 24

Therefore, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"Given that Mr. Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, and a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures, we can calculate the number of trucks that reached the farmers as follows:

Let's denote the total number of trucks dispatched as T = 20. The number of trucks with mechanical failures is a quarter of T, which can be expressed as (1/4)T. Therefore, the number of trucks that reached the farmers is T - (1/4)T.

Number of trucks with mechanical failures = (1/4)T
= (1/4)(20)
= 5

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = T - (1/4)T
= 20 - 5
= 15

Since each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is the product of the number of trucks that reached the farmers and the tons per truck:

Total tons of fertiliser = Number of trucks that reached the farmers * Tons per truck
= 15 * 20
= 300

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine the cost of purchasing 6 pounds of butter under the given promotion, we can analyze the situation as follows:

Let's denote the cost of one pound of butter as $4.00. The promotion offers a buy one get one half off deal, which can be interpreted as a 50% discount on the second pound of butter for every two pounds purchased.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Cost of 2 pounds of butter = $4.00 (full price) + $2.00 (50% discount) = $6.00

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate the total cost by determining the number of 2-pound sets required:

6 pounds / 2 pounds per set = 3 sets

The cost for 3 sets of 2 pounds of butter is:

3 sets * $6.00 (cost per 2-pound set) = $18.00

Therefore, the total cost of purchasing 6 pounds of butter under the given promotion is $18.00.

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To determine the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests and multiply it by the cost per guest, then add the initial fee.

Let's denote the number of Kayla's classmates as $C$, the number of girls in her dance class as $D$, the number of family members as $F$, and the number of guests who could not come as $G$. We are given that $C = 25$, $D = 7$, $F = 13$, and $G = 4$. The total number of guests invited is the sum of these groups, which is $C + D + F = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45$. However, since only 4 guests could not come, the total number of guests attending the party is $45 - G = 45 - 4 = 41$.

The initial fee to rent the theater is $125, and the cost per additional guest is $6. To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests, which is the product of the number of additional guests and the cost per guest. The number of additional guests is the difference between the total number of guests attending and the initial 20 guests, which is $41 - 20 = 21$. Therefore, the cost for the additional guests is $21 \times 6 = 126$. Finally, the total cost is the sum of the initial fee and the cost for the additional guests, which is $125 + 126 = 251$.

The final answer is: $251"
"Given that Maggie and Riza each had an initial amount of $60, we can model their expenditures as follows:

Let's denote the initial amount of money Maggie and Riza had as M and R, respectively. We are given that M = R = $60.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which can be expressed as (1/4)M. Therefore, the amount of money Maggie has left is M - (1/4)M = (3/4)M.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which can be expressed as (1/3)R. Therefore, the amount of money Riza has left is R - (1/3)R = (2/3)R.

Since M = R = $60, we can substitute these values into the expressions for the remaining amounts:

Maggie's remaining amount: (3/4)M = (3/4)($60) = $45
Riza's remaining amount: (2/3)R = (2/3)($60) = $40

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add the remaining amounts of Maggie and Riza:

Total remaining amount = (3/4)M + (2/3)R
= (3/4)($60) + (2/3)($60)
= $45 + $40
= $85

The final answer is: $85"
"To determine the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can start by establishing the daily consumption of the first two monkeys. The first monkey consumes 10 bananas per day, while the second monkey consumes 4 more bananas than the first, which equates to 14 bananas per day.

Let's denote the total number of bananas consumed by the three monkeys in a week as 315. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the daily consumption by dividing the total number of bananas by 7:

$$\frac{315}{7} = 45$$

This indicates that the total number of bananas consumed by the three monkeys in a day is 45. Given that the first two monkeys consume 10 and 14 bananas, respectively, we can calculate the number of bananas consumed by the third monkey as follows:

Let x be the number of bananas consumed by the third monkey. Then, the total number of bananas consumed by the three monkeys is given by:

10 + 14 + x = 45

Simplifying the equation, we get:

24 + x = 45

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation yields:

x = 21

Therefore, the third monkey consumes 21 bananas per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he placed. 

Let's break down the information: Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, which is equivalent to 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Subsequently, he completed another 500-piece puzzle. To find the total number of pieces he placed, we add the number of pieces from the first puzzle to the number of pieces from the second puzzle: 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

Therefore, Teddy placed a total of 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine the number of quarters Jenny leaves with after purchasing the roses, we must first calculate the total cost of the flowers. Since she buys 15 roses, it is more economical to purchase 1 dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses. The cost of 1 dozen roses is $15, and the cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6. Therefore, the total cost of the roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrives with 5 $5 bills, totaling $25. To find the change she receives, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only provides change in quarters, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total revenue generated by Terry, we can calculate the revenue from each item and then sum the results.

The revenue from milkshakes is calculated as the product of the number of milkshakes sold and the price per milkshake: 6 × $5.50 = $33.

The revenue from burger platters is calculated as the product of the number of platters sold and the price per platter: 9 × $11 = $99.

The revenue from sodas is calculated as the product of the number of sodas sold and the price per soda: 20 × $1.50 = $30.

To find the total revenue, we sum the revenues from each item: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To determine the total time Paul will wait for his train, we can break down the problem into a series of time intervals. Let's denote the arrival time of the first train as $t_1 = 10$ minutes.

1. The first train arrives at $t_1 = 10$ minutes and stays for 20 minutes. Therefore, the departure time of the first train is $t_1 + 20 = 30$ minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is $t_1 + 30 = 40$ minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 20 = 5$ minutes. So, the departure time of the second train is $40 + 5 = 45$ minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is $45 + 60 = 105$ minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so its departure time is also 105 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is $105 + 20 = 125$ minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is 0 minutes, Paul needs to wait from 0 to 125 minutes for the fourth train. However, we need to consider the time he waits from the first train's arrival to the fourth train's arrival.

- Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train.
- He waits from 30 to 40 minutes for the second train.
- He waits from 45 to 105 minutes for the third train.
- He waits from 105 to 125 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is the sum of these intervals: $10 + (40 - 30) + (105 - 45) + (125 - 105) = 10 + 10 + 60 + 20 = 100$ minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week, we can use a simple linear equation. Let's denote the number of weeks as 'w'. The total number of toothpicks collected is the product of the rate and the number of weeks, which should be equal to the target number of toothpicks (200).

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

10w = 200

To find the number of weeks, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10:

w = 200 / 10

w = 20

However, this is the total number of weeks Melanie has already saved toothpicks. Since she has already saved toothpicks for 12 weeks, we need to subtract this from the total to find the additional weeks required:

Additional weeks = w - 12
= 20 - 12
= 8

Therefore, Melanie will need 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. Given that he purchased it at 75% of the original price, we can express this as a mathematical operation:

P_bought = P_original \* 0.75

where P_bought is the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and P_original is the original price of the watch, which is $2000.

P_bought = 2000 \* 0.75
P_bought = $1500

Next, we need to calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend. He sold it at 120% of the price he bought it, which can be expressed as:

P_sold = P_bought \* 1.2

P_sold = 1500 \* 1.2
P_sold = $1800

Now, we can determine the discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price by subtracting the price he paid from the original price:

Discount = P_original - P_sold
Discount = 2000 - 1800
Discount = $200

To find the percentage discount, we can use the formula:

Percentage Discount = (Discount / P_original) \* 100
Percentage Discount = (200 / 2000) \* 100
Percentage Discount = 10%

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs and the rate at which they create jellyfish per second.

First, we calculate the total number of seconds in 4 hours:

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5. Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds is:

Jellyfish = Number of springs * Number of seconds * Rate of jellyfish creation per second
= 5 springs * 14400 seconds * 1 jellyfish/second
= 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"To determine Frankie's bowling score, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Binkie's score as B and Frankie's score as F. We are given that Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's score, which can be expressed as F = 2B + 15.

Given that Binkie's score is 90, we can substitute this value into the equation to solve for Frankie's score:

F = 2B + 15
F = 2(90) + 15
F = 180 + 15
F = 195

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195.

The final answer is: $\boxed{195}$"
"To determine the time it took James to reach the store, we must first calculate the total distance traveled. Since James walked halfway to the store and then back, the total distance is twice the distance to the store, which is 2 * 4 miles = 8 miles.

Given that James walks at a constant speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula for time, which is time = distance / speed. Substituting the values, we get time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

Therefore, the time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jenny saved by purchasing bananas in bunches instead of individually, we can employ a straightforward cost comparison.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas purchased: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of purchasing 40 bananas individually would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

The cost of purchasing 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost would be: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by purchasing the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Given that Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence, and they agree to split it such that Harry receives 60 feet more than Sam, we can model this situation using a linear equation. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam receives as 'x'. Consequently, Harry receives 'x + 60' feet of fence.

The total amount of fence is the sum of the fence received by both Sam and Harry, which is given as 100 feet. Therefore, we can express this relationship as an equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation yields:

2x = 40

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us the value of x:

x = 20

Thus, Sam receives 20 feet of fence.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the rate of growth of the crocodile, we can utilize the concept of linear growth, which is a fundamental principle in mathematical modeling of population dynamics and growth processes. The formula for linear growth is given by:

y = mx + b

where y is the final value, m is the growth rate, x is the time, and b is the initial value. However, in this scenario, we are dealing with a simple linear growth model where the initial value (b) is zero, and the growth rate (m) is constant.

Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can calculate the growth rate (m) as follows:

m = Δy / Δx
= 8 inches / 4 years
= 2 inches/year

Now, to find the total growth in 13 years, we can use the formula for linear growth:

y = mx + b
Since b = 0, the equation simplifies to:
y = mx

Substituting the values, we get:
y = 2 inches/year * 13 years
y = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

The final answer is: 26"
"To determine Marcel's total earnings from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

Let's denote the number of MTB bikes sold as x. Since half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes, the number of Trekking bikes is 300 / 2 = 150. The number of BMX bikes sold is 15% of the total bikes, which is 0.15 * 300 = 45. Therefore, the number of MTB bikes sold is 300 - (150 + 45) = 105.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"In the context of agricultural operations, the problem at hand can be analyzed using basic principles of production and consumption rates. Let's denote the number of bales produced by the farmer as P and the number of bales picked up by the truck as C.

Given that the farmer produces 5 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, the total number of bales produced (P) can be calculated as:

P = 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales

Similarly, the truck picks up 3 bales per hour and operates for 6 hours, resulting in a total of:

C = 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

To determine the number of bales left in the field, we need to subtract the number of bales picked up (C) from the total number of bales produced (P):

Bales left in the field = P - C = 30 - 18 = 12 bales

Therefore, the number of bales left in the field after a 6-hour workday is 12."
"To determine the total hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the total minutes spent in class and the additional minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the total minutes spent in class. John has 6 regular periods and 2 extra classes, each lasting 40 minutes. The total minutes spent in class per day is given by:

$$
\text{minutes per day} = (6 + 2) \times 40 = 8 \times 40 = 320 \text{ minutes}
$$

Since John attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes spent in class per week is:

$$
\text{minutes per week} = 320 \times 5 = 1600 \text{ minutes}
$$

Next, we need to calculate the additional minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. The total minutes in a week is:

$$
\text{minutes per week} = 7 \times 24 \times 60 = 1680 \text{ minutes}
$$

Therefore, the additional minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday is:

$$
\text{additional minutes} = \frac{1}{16} \times 1680 = 105 \text{ minutes}
$$

Since John spends this additional time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total additional minutes per week is:

$$
\text{total additional minutes} = 105 \times 2 = 210 \text{ minutes}
$$

Now, we can find the total minutes spent learning per week by adding the minutes spent in class and the additional minutes:

$$
\text{total minutes} = 1600 + 210 = 1810 \text{ minutes}
$$

Finally, we convert the total minutes to hours:

$$
\text{total hours} = \frac{1810}{60} = 30.17 \text{ hours}
$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{30.17}$"
"Given the scenario, we can model the height of the ball after each bounce using a geometric sequence. The initial height of the ball is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet. The common ratio of the sequence is 2/3, representing the proportion of the height retained after each bounce.

To find the height of the ball after the second bounce, we can use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence: $a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the term number.

In this case, $a_1 = 72$, $r = 2/3$, and $n = 3$ (since we want to find the height after the second bounce). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

$a_3 = 72 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{3-1} = 72 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = 72 \cdot \frac{4}{9} = 32$

Therefore, the height of the ball after the second bounce is 32 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we can approach this problem by calculating the height of each child step by step, utilizing basic arithmetic operations.

First, we convert the height of the first child from feet to inches, as 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches. Therefore, the height of the first child in inches is $6 \times 12 = 72$ inches.

Next, we calculate the height of the second child, which is two inches taller than the first child. This yields a height of $72 + 2 = 74$ inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, resulting in a height of $74 - 5 = 69$ inches.

Lastly, the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, leading to a height of $69 + 3 = 72$ inches.

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the total earnings of the apple orchard, we must first calculate the number of bags sold. Given that each bag contains 10 apples, we can use the formula:

Number of bags = Total number of apples / Number of apples per bag

Substituting the given values, we have:

Number of bags = 2000 apples / 10 apples per bag
= 200 bags

Now, to find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

Total earnings = Number of bags × Price per bag
= 200 bags × $5 per bag
= $1000

Therefore, the apple orchard earned $1000 from selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag.

The final answer is: $1000"
"To determine the original weight of the triceratops, we can apply a step-by-step approach based on the information provided. Let's denote the original weight of the triceratops as $W$. 

First, the T-Rex consumed half of the triceratops, leaving $\frac{1}{2}W$ kilograms. Then, the velociraptors scavenged half of the remaining meat, which is $\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}W\right) = \frac{1}{4}W$ kilograms. 

We are given that the Allosaurus consumed the last 270 kilograms, which is half of what the velociraptors had. Therefore, the velociraptors had $270 \times 2 = 540$ kilograms. Since the velociraptors had $\frac{1}{4}W$ kilograms, we can set up the equation:

$$\frac{1}{4}W = 540$$

To solve for $W$, we can multiply both sides by 4:

$$W = 540 \times 4$$

$$W = 2160$$

Thus, the original weight of the triceratops was 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2160}$"
"To determine the cost of painting the room, we must first calculate the total surface area of the walls. The north and south walls, each measuring 10 feet in width and 8 feet in height, contribute a combined area of 2 * (10 * 8) = 160 square feet. The east and west walls, measuring 5 feet in width and 8 feet in height, contribute a combined area of 2 * (5 * 8) = 80 square feet. Therefore, the total surface area of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Given that a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we can calculate the number of gallons required as 240 / 20 = 12 gallons. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost of painting the room is 12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of her selecting a shaken can from the remaining options.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, with 3 shaken and 9 unshaken. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas. Her brother then took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, resulting in 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can can be calculated as the ratio of the number of shaken cans to the total number of cans:

P(shaken) = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
P(shaken) = 1 / 7

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

P(shaken) = (1 / 7) × 100
P(shaken) = 14.29%

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 14.29%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.29}$"
"Given that two trains depart from a station in opposite directions, with one train traveling at 60 miles per hour and the other at half that distance per hour, we can calculate the distance between them after 3 hours.

Let's denote the speed of the first train as $v_1 = 60$ miles per hour and the speed of the second train as $v_2 = \frac{1}{2}v_1 = 30$ miles per hour.

The distance traveled by the first train after 3 hours is given by $d_1 = v_1 \cdot t = 60 \cdot 3 = 180$ miles.

Similarly, the distance traveled by the second train after 3 hours is given by $d_2 = v_2 \cdot t = 30 \cdot 3 = 90$ miles.

The total distance between the two trains is the sum of the distances traveled by each train, which is $d_{total} = d_1 + d_2 = 180 + 90 = 270$ miles.

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the total number of people Billy can help, we first need to calculate the number of days he is available to volunteer. The period in question spans from March 1st to April 19th, which encompasses 31 days in March and 19 days in April, resulting in a total of 50 days.

However, Billy takes 20% of these days off, which is equivalent to 0.2 * 50 = 10 days. Therefore, the number of days he is available to volunteer is 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Given that Billy can assist 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, his daily capacity is 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

To find the total number of people he can help, we multiply the number of available days by his daily capacity: 40 * 6 = 240.

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we must first calculate the total number of individuals transported by the buses and private cars. 

The number of people transported by the buses can be calculated as follows:

12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Similarly, the number of people transported by the private cars is:

20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, we can find the total number of people transported by adding the number of people transported by the buses and the private cars:

420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question does not provide information about the total number of people present at the church, we can assume that the number of people inside the church is equal to the number of people transported, which is 480.

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To determine Jeff's age, we can establish a linear relationship between the ages of the three individuals. Let's denote Mike's age as M, Martha's age as m, and Jeff's age as j. We are given that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha (j = m + 10) and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike (m = M - 4).

Given that Mike is 24 years old, we can substitute M = 24 into the equation m = M - 4 to find Martha's age.

m = 24 - 4
m = 20

Now that we have Martha's age, we can use the equation j = m + 10 to find Jeff's age.

j = 20 + 10
j = 30

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the time difference between riding the biggest and the second biggest waterslides at Five Flags, we can apply the concept of time and speed. The time it takes to ride a slide is inversely proportional to its speed. 

For the biggest slide, with a length of 300 feet and a speed of 60 feet per minute, the time taken can be calculated as follows:

t = d / v
= 300 / 60
= 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide, with a length of 240 feet and a speed of 80 feet per minute, the time taken can be calculated as follows:

t = d / v
= 240 / 80
= 3 minutes

Now, to find the time difference between the two slides, we subtract the time taken for the second biggest slide from the time taken for the biggest slide:

time difference = time for biggest slide - time for second biggest slide
= 5 - 3

"To determine the total time spent on lunch and breaks, we can calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by the number of days.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. The total time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: $\frac{60}{60} = 1$ hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. After 5 days, the total time spent is $1 \times 5 = 5$ hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the distance run by Ahito, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the distance run by Ahito as A, Amber's distance as A_m, and Micah's distance as M. We are given that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles, A_m = 8 miles, and M = 3.5A_m.

Given the total distance equation: A + A_m + M = 52

Substituting the given values, we get: A + 8 + 3.5(8) = 52

Simplifying the equation: A + 8 + 28 = 52

Combine like terms: A + 36 = 52

Subtract 36 from both sides: A = 52 - 36

A = 16

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item and then add that to the initial charge.

First, let's calculate the initial balance after the return:

Initial charge: $85.00
Return: -$15.00
New balance = Initial charge - Return = $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the frying pan and the towels after applying the discounts.

Frying pan: The original price of the frying pan is $20.00, and it is on sale for 20% off. To calculate the discount, we can use the formula:

Discount = Original price × (Discount percentage / 100)
= $20.00 × (20 / 100)
= $20.00 × 0.20
= $4.00

Price of frying pan = Original price - Discount
= $20.00 - $4.00
= $16.00

Towels: The original price of the towels is $30.00, and they are on sale for 10% off. To calculate the discount, we can use the formula:

Discount = Original price × (Discount percentage / 100)
= $30.00 × (10 / 100)
= $30.00 × 0.10
= $3.00

Price of towels = Original price - Discount
= $30.00 - $3.00
= $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the new purchases:

Total cost of new purchases = Price of frying pan + Price of towels
= $16.00 + $27.00
= $43.00

Finally, we can calculate the new balance on Sheila's credit card by adding the total cost of the new purchases to the initial balance after the return:

New balance = Initial balance after return + Total cost of new purchases
= $70.00 + $43.00
= $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To determine the total number of jellyfish in the tank, we can utilize the information provided to establish a mathematical relationship.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. Given that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. Furthermore, a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, which implies that the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are informed that when a UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. This allows us to establish the equation x/15 = 6, as the number of large jellyfish that change color is equal to the given number of jellyfish that change color under UV light.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15, yielding x = 6 * 15.

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"Given the problem statement, we can establish a linear relationship between the ages of Caroline, Ben, and Chris. Let's denote Chris's age as C, Ben's age as B, and Caroline's age as A. We are given that Chris is 4 years old, so C = 4.

We are also given that Ben is two times older than Chris, which can be expressed as B = 2C. Substituting the value of C, we get B = 2(4) = 8.

Furthermore, we are given that Caroline is three times older than Ben, which can be expressed as A = 3B. Substituting the value of B, we get A = 3(8) = 24.

Therefore, Caroline's age is 24 years.

"To determine the number of years Lauren needs to work to save for retirement, we must first calculate the total amount she requires for a 20-year retirement period, assuming she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary of $100,000.

The annual retirement income will be 40% of $100,000, which is:

$$
\text{Annual retirement income} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
$$

Since Lauren plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is the product of her annual retirement income and the number of years in retirement:

$$
\text{Total savings needed} = \text{Annual retirement income} \times \text{Number of years in retirement} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
$$

Given that Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary, her annual savings will be:

$$
\text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
$$

To find the number of years it will take her to save the required amount, we divide the total savings needed by her annual savings:

$$
\text{Number of years} = \frac{\text{Total savings needed}}{\text{Annual savings}} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40
$$

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save for her retirement.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the length of each final cut, we can employ a straightforward approach by applying the principles of division. Given that Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon, we first divide this total length by the number of parts it will be cut into, which is 4. This yields:

$$\frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}$$

Next, we divide the result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into, which is 5. This gives us:

$$\frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}$$

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of girls in the school, we can utilize the concept of proportions. Given that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys, we can establish a proportion to find the total number of students in the school.

Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. We can set up the following proportion:

40% of x = 240

To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for 'x' by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

This indicates that the total number of students in the school is 600.

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we can multiply the total number of students by the decimal equivalent of 60%:

Number of girls = 0.6 * 600
= 360

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"To determine the total expenditure at the gardening shop, we can apply a straightforward arithmetic operation. The cost of the set of pots and the sack of garden soil can be added together to obtain the initial total, followed by the subtraction of the coupon discount.

Let's denote the cost of the pots as P and the cost of the garden soil as S. The initial total expenditure can be expressed as P + S. Given that P = $19 and S = $26, we can calculate the initial total as follows:

P + S = $19 + $26 = $45

Next, we need to account for the coupon discount, denoted as D. The total expenditure after the discount can be calculated by subtracting D from the initial total:

Total expenditure = (P + S) - D
= $45 - $7
= $38

Therefore, the total amount spent at the gardening shop is $38."
"To determine the average height of heels at the cocktail party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and divide it by the total number of women.

Let's denote the number of women wearing 4-inch heels as $n_1 = 3$ and the number of women wearing 2-inch heels as $n_2 = 3$. The average height of heels can be calculated using the formula:

$$\text{Average height} = \frac{n_1 \times h_1 + n_2 \times h_2}{n_1 + n_2}$$

where $h_1$ is the height of the 4-inch heels and $h_2$ is the height of the 2-inch heels.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$\text{Average height} = \frac{3 \times 4 + 3 \times 2}{3 + 3}$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$\text{Average height} = \frac{12 + 6}{6}$$

$$\text{Average height} = \frac{18}{6}$$

$$\text{Average height} = 3$$

Therefore, the average height of heels at the cocktail party is 3 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the additional daily mileage Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey within the 30-day window, we first calculate the total daily mileage she plans to cover. Given that she intends to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, her daily mileage is 2 * 125 = 250 miles.

To find the number of days required to complete the 9,300-mile journey at this rate, we divide the total miles by the daily mileage: 9,300 miles / 250 miles/day = 37.2 days.

However, Soledad only has 30 days available in June. To determine the additional daily mileage required to complete the journey within this timeframe, we first calculate the total miles she can cover in 30 days at the planned rate: 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles.

The difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the miles she can hike in 30 days is 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles.

To find the additional daily mileage required, we divide the difference by the number of days: 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day.

Therefore, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her 9,300-mile journey within the 30-day window.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the total revenue the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of ball and sum them together. This can be achieved by multiplying the quantity of each ball type by its respective price and then summing the results.

Let's denote the number of red balls as R = 3, the number of blue balls as B = 11, and the number of green balls as G = 25. The prices of the red, blue, and green balls are $9, $5, and $3, respectively.

The total revenue from selling the red balls is given by the product of the number of red balls and the price of each red ball: 3 × $9 = $27.

The total revenue from selling the blue balls is given by the product of the number of blue balls and the price of each blue ball: 11 × $5 = $55.

The total revenue from selling the green balls is given by the product of the number of green balls and the price of each green ball: 25 × $3 = $75.

To find the total revenue, we sum the revenues from each type of ball: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

Therefore, the total revenue the store will receive after selling all the balls is $157.

The final answer is: $157"
"To determine the amount of apples James will have left, we need to calculate the portions taken by Pierre and Paul. 

Pierre's share is a quarter of the total 12 kg, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3$ kg. 

Paul's share is one-third of the total 12 kg, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4$ kg.

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is the sum of their individual shares, which is $3 + 4 = 7$ kg.

To find the amount left for James, we subtract the total taken by Pierre and Paul from the initial amount: $12 - 7 = 5$ kg.

Therefore, James will have 5 kg of apples left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the temperature in the morning, we can apply a simple arithmetic operation based on the given information. The initial temperature is 2 degrees Celsius, which undergoes a temperature drop of 8 degrees Celsius overnight. This results in a new temperature, which is then increased by 3 degrees Celsius in the morning.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

T_morning = T_initial - ΔT_drop + ΔT_increase
= 2 - 8 + 3
= -3

Therefore, the temperature in the morning is -3 degrees Celsius.

"To determine the amount of money Raymond has left, we can apply the principles of basic arithmetic operations, specifically addition and subtraction, within the context of financial transactions.

Initially, Raymond possessed $21. Subsequently, he received an allowance of $11, increasing his total to $21 + $11 = $32.

However, he incurred two expenses: a comic book costing $5 and a puzzle costing $19. To calculate the remaining amount, we must subtract these expenses from his current total: $32 - $5 - $19.

Using the order of operations, we first subtract $5 from $32, yielding $27. Then, we subtract $19 from $27, resulting in $8.

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the cost of each book, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of each book as x. Since Anna spent a total of $10 on the two books, we can express this as 2x = 10, where 2 represents the number of books and x is the cost of each book.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2, resulting in x = 10/2.

x = 10/2

x = 5

Therefore, each book cost $5.

"To determine the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year, we can apply a simple percentage increase calculation. Given that there was a 20% increase in enrollment from last year, we can express this as a mathematical operation.

Let x be the number of students enrolled last year. We are given that x = 50.

The 20% increase can be represented as 0.20x, which is equivalent to 20% of the previous year's enrollment.

To find the total number of students enrolled this year, we add the increase to the previous year's enrollment:

Total enrollment this year = x + 0.20x
= 1.20x
= 1.20(50)
= 60

Therefore, the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year is 60.

60"
"To determine the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we can utilize the concept of a constant rate of blinking. Given that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can establish a rate of blinking as follows:

Let's denote the rate of blinking as $r$ blinks per minute. We can express this as:

$r = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}}$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$r = 51 \text{ blinks per minute}$

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times. Let's denote the time required as $t$ minutes. We can express this as:

$t = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{r \text{ blinks per minute}}$

Substituting the value of $r$, we get:

$t = \frac{459}{51}$

Evaluating the expression, we get:

$t = 9 \text{ minutes}$

Therefore, the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times is 9 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the difference between the number of female and male fishes in Tate's garden pond, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of each sex and then finding the difference.

Initially, there are 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes. Tate then acquires 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes.

The total number of male guppies can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total male guppies} = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

The total number of female guppies is:
\[ \text{Total female guppies} = 7 + 1 = 8 \]

The total number of male goldfishes is:
\[ \text{Total male goldfishes} = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

The total number of female goldfishes is:
\[ \text{Total female goldfishes} = 5 + 3 = 8 \]

To find the total number of male fishes, we sum the total number of male guppies and male goldfishes:
\[ \text{Total male fishes} = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Similarly, to find the total number of female fishes, we sum the total number of female guppies and female goldfishes:
\[ \text{Total female fishes} = 8 + 8 = 16 \]

The difference between the number of female and male fishes is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total female fishes} - \text{Total male fishes} = 16 - 11 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes.

"To determine the total distance John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we must first calculate the round-trip distance. Given that it takes him 2 hours to drive to his parents at a speed of 70 mph, we can use the formula for distance:

d = rt

where d is the distance, r is the rate (speed), and t is the time.

For a one-way trip, the distance is:

d = 70 mph * 2 hours
d = 140 miles

Since the round-trip distance is twice the one-way distance, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:

d_round_trip = 2 * 140 miles
d_round_trip = 280 miles

As John visits his parents twice a month, we need to calculate the total distance driven in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, and there are 2 visits per month, the total distance driven in a month is:

d_total = 2 * d_round_trip * 4
d_total = 2 * 280 miles * 4
d_total = 2240 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{2240}$"
"To determine the distance Brian will walk in 7 days, we first need to calculate the total distance Sofie will cover in the same timeframe. Given that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, her total distance can be calculated as the product of her daily distance and the number of days, which yields 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles.

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can infer that Brian's distance will be half of Sofie's total distance. Therefore, Brian's distance can be calculated as 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the production rate of the fifth worker, we can start by calculating the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in a 10-hour shift.

The two workers producing 6 toys per hour will collectively produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The other two workers producing 4 toys per hour will collectively produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 
Therefore, the total production rate of the first four workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Over a 10-hour shift, the first four workers will produce 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 additional toys to fulfill the order, the total number of toys required is 400 + 20 = 420 toys. 
The fifth worker must have produced the remaining 420 - 200 = 220 toys in the same 10-hour period.

To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the total number of toys produced by the worker by the number of hours worked: 220 toys / 10 hours = 22 toys per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we must first calculate the weight of each dog. Given that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, we can calculate the weight of Elijah's dogs as follows:

Let's denote the weight of Kory's dog as $K = 60$ pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so its weight can be expressed as $\frac{1}{4}K = \frac{1}{4}(60) = 15$ pounds. Similarly, Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so its weight can be expressed as $\frac{1}{2}K = \frac{1}{2}(60) = 30$ pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of Elijah's dogs by adding their individual weights: $15 + 30 = 45$ pounds. To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: $45 + 60 = 105$ pounds.

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{105}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a backward approach, starting from the information given about Kris. We know that Kris had 7 stickers, which is half of what Luis had. Let's denote the number of stickers Luis had as L. Then, we can express the relationship between Kris and Luis as:

7 = L/2

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

L = 14

Now, we know that Luis had 14 stickers, which is half of what Seth had. Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had as S. Then, we can express the relationship between Luis and Seth as:

14 = S/2

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

S = 28

Therefore, Seth had 28 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is: 28"
"To determine the total number of small bags John can make, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's and then divide by the number of M&M's per small bag.

First, we calculate the total number of M&M's. Since John buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, we can find the total number of ounces by multiplying the number of large bags by the weight of each bag:

3 large bags × 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces

Next, we know that an ounce of M&M's contains 30 M&M's. Therefore, we can find the total number of M&M's by multiplying the total number of ounces by the number of M&M's per ounce:

30 ounces × 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, we need to find the number of small bags John can make. Since each small bag contains 10 M&M's, we can divide the total number of M&M's by 10:

900 M&M's ÷ 10 M&M's/small bag = 90 small bags

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M's.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of days it will take Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we must first calculate half of the earth's circumference. The earth's circumference is approximately 40,000 kilometers. 

Half of the earth's circumference is given by:

C/2 = 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can calculate the number of days required to cover this distance using the formula:

t = d / r

where t is the time in days, d is the distance (20,000 km), and r is the rate (400 km/day).

t = 20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we can establish a hierarchical relationship between the speeds of the three cars. Let's denote the speed of the average car as $v_{avg}$, the speed of the 2nd fastest car as $v_{2nd}$, and the speed of the fastest car as $v_{fast}$.

Given that the average car can go 120 miles per hour, we have $v_{avg} = 120$ mph.

The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we can express its speed as $v_{2nd} = 5v_{avg} = 5 \cdot 120 = 600$ mph.

The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so we can express its speed as $v_{fast} = 1.25v_{2nd} = 1.25 \cdot 600 = 750$ mph.

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is 750 mph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine Vince's current age, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Vince's current age as V. Two years ago, Liam's age was twice that of Vince's, which can be expressed as:

Liam's age two years ago = 2 * Vince's age two years ago

Given that Liam is currently 16 years old, we can represent his age two years ago as 16 - 2 = 14. Therefore, we have:

14 = 2 * (V - 2)

To solve for V, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

V - 2 = 14 / 2
V - 2 = 7

Now, we can isolate V by adding 2 to both sides of the equation:

V = 7 + 2
V = 9

Therefore, Vince's current age is 9 years old.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we can express this as A = M.

We are also given that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, which can be represented as C + S = 30.

Furthermore, we know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so we can express this as C = S + 12.

We can now solve for S by substituting the expression for C into the equation C + S = 30, yielding (S + 12) + S = 30.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives 2S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 9.

Now that we have found S, we can determine C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can express this as A + M + C + S = 56.

Substituting the values of A, M, C, and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combining like terms gives 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2A = 26.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we must first calculate the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately, then sum them to obtain the overall weight.

The weight of the crayons can be calculated by multiplying the number of crayons by the weight of each crayon. Given that Nik has 200 crayons, each weighing 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is $200 \times 1 = 200$ ounces.

Next, we need to determine the number of boxes required to hold the crayons. Since each box can hold 8 crayons, the number of boxes needed is $200 \div 8 = 25$ boxes.

The weight of each box is given as 8 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of the boxes is $25 \times 8 = 200$ ounces.

To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we sum their individual weights: $200$ ounces (crayons) $+ 200$ ounces (boxes) $= 400$ ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: $\frac{400}{16} = 25$ pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total revenue generated from selling the planks, we first need to calculate the number of logs that can be obtained from the 80-foot tree. Given that John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we can express this as a percentage of the total length.

Let's denote the total length of the tree as $L = 80$ feet. The length of the logs, $L_{logs}$, is then given by $L_{logs} = 0.8L = 0.8 \times 80 = 64$ feet.

Since each log has a length of 4 feet, the number of logs, $N_{logs}$, can be calculated as $N_{logs} = \frac{L_{logs}}{4} = \frac{64}{4} = 16$.

From each log, John cuts 5 planks, so the total number of planks, $N_{planks}$, is given by $N_{planks} = N_{logs} \times 5 = 16 \times 5 = 80$.

The revenue generated from selling each plank is $R_{plank} = \$1.2$. Therefore, the total revenue, $R_{total}$, is $R_{total} = N_{planks} \times R_{plank} = 80 \times \$1.2 = \$96$.

The final answer is: $96"
"To determine the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we can approach this problem by first establishing the individual salaries and then summing them.

Let's denote Valerie's monthly salary as V, her brother's monthly salary as B, and their mother's monthly salary as M. We are given that V = $5000 and B = 2V. 

Substituting the value of V into the equation for B, we get B = 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is V + B = $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

We are also given that their mother's monthly salary is twice their combined salary, so M = 2 * (V + B) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: V + B + M = $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we can apply the concept of uniform motion and the formula distance = speed × time. 

Let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as $v_b$ and the speed on the sidewalk as $v_s$. We are given that $v_s = 2v_b$. 

We also know that the distance covered on the beach is 2 miles and the time spent on the beach is 40 minutes. Using the formula distance = speed × time, we can write $2 = v_b \times 40$. Solving for $v_b$, we get $v_b = \frac{1}{20}$ miles per minute.

Since $v_s = 2v_b$, we can substitute the value of $v_b$ to get $v_s = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10}$ miles per minute.

Now, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. The distance is 1 mile and the speed is $\frac{1}{10}$ miles per minute. Using the formula time = distance/speed, we get time = $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10$ minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is $40 + 10 = 50$ minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of additional weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal of $60, we can employ a straightforward approach based on linear arithmetic.

First, let's calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far. Given that she saves $4 per week for 8 weeks, we can express this as a simple multiplication:

$$\text{Total savings} = \text{Weekly savings} \times \text{Number of weeks}$$

$$\text{Total savings} = \$4/\text{week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = \$32$$

Next, we need to find the remaining amount Jane needs to save to reach her goal of $60. This can be calculated by subtracting her current savings from the target amount:

$$\text{Remaining savings} = \text{Target savings} - \text{Current savings}$$

$$\text{Remaining savings} = \$60 - \$32 = \$28$$

Now, we can determine the number of additional weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal by dividing the remaining savings by her weekly savings:

$$\text{Additional weeks} = \frac{\text{Remaining savings}}{\text{Weekly savings}}$$

$$\text{Additional weeks} = \frac{\$28}{\$4/\text{week}} = 7 \text{ weeks}$$

Therefore, Jane needs 7 additional weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the number of blue birds in the three trees that each had 7 blue birds. This can be represented as 3 * 7 = 21 blue birds.

Next, we calculate the number of blue birds in the two trees that each had 4 blue birds. This can be represented as 2 * 4 = 8 blue birds.

Lastly, we consider the tree that had 3 blue birds.

To find the total number of blue birds, we sum the number of blue birds in each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's analyze the problem using a mathematical approach.

Given that Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles and has a total of 60 marbles, we can set up an equation to represent this situation. Since 1 dozen is equivalent to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 × 12 = 24. Therefore, the equation can be written as:

x + 24 = 60

where x represents the initial number of marbles Bob has.

To solve for x, we can subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

This implies that Bob initially has 36 marbles.

Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, we can find the new number of marbles he has by subtracting 10 from the initial number:

New number of marbles = 36 - 10
New number of marbles = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we can apply the concept of weighted averages. Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the weighted average of the two temperatures. The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces, with 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle.

The weighted average temperature of the two mugs is given by:

$$\frac{(33 \times 4) + (x \times 1)}{5}$$

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. We can set up the inequality:

$$\frac{(33 \times 4) + (x \times 1)}{5} \geq 40$$

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

$$\frac{132 + x}{5} \geq 40$$

Multiplying both sides by 5, we get:

$$132 + x \geq 200$$

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

$$x \geq 68$$

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is at least 68 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Let's start by calculating the number of cows. Melanie's father begins with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. The number of cows added in three weeks can be calculated as follows:

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

The total number of cows is the sum of the initial number of cows and the number of cows added:

Total number of cows = 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. The number of chickens added in three weeks is:

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

The total number of chickens is the sum of the initial number of chickens and the number of chickens added:

Total number of chickens = 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of the total number of cows and the total number of chickens:

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"To determine the cost of each single bagel after a 10% discount on a purchase of 4 packs, we first calculate the total cost of the packs before the discount. Given that each pack costs $10.00 and contains 9 bagels, the total cost of 4 packs is:

$$
\text{Total cost of 4 packs} = 4 \times 10.00 = \$40.00
$$

Next, we calculate the discount amount, which is 10% of the total cost of 4 packs:

$$
\text{Discount} = 0.10 \times 40.00 = \$4.00
$$

The discounted cost is then obtained by subtracting the discount from the total cost of 4 packs:

$$
\text{Discounted cost} = 40.00 - 4.00 = \$36.00
$$

Now, we calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs:

$$
\text{Total number of bagels} = 4 \times 9 = 36
$$

Finally, we determine the cost of each single bagel by dividing the discounted cost by the total number of bagels:

$$
\text{Cost per bagel} = \frac{36.00}{36} = \$1.00
$$

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To determine the number of potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to establish the relationship between scoops of mashed potatoes and the number of potatoes required to make them. It is given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's denote the number of potatoes required to make 1 less than 3 scoops as $x$. Then, we have the equation $x = 6 - 3$, which simplifies to $x = 3$. This implies that it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we are given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's denote the number of scoops Gomer ate as $y$. Then, we have the equation $y = 23 - 5$, which simplifies to $y = 18$.

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, the number of potatoes Gomer ate can be calculated as follows:

$$\text{Number of potatoes} = \frac{y}{2} \times 3$$

Substituting $y = 18$ into the equation, we get:

$$\text{Number of potatoes} = \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 27$$

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we can break down the problem into two distinct periods: the first 30 days and the subsequent 30 days.

During the initial 30 days, Chester consumes 3 eggs per day. This can be calculated as follows:

3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the subsequent 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs per day. This can be calculated as follows:

5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

To find the total number of eggs consumed over the 60-day period, we add the number of eggs consumed in each period:

90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since we are interested in the number of dozens of eggs, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12:

240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of blue jellybeans in the jar, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of blue jellybeans as B, the number of green jellybeans as G, and the number of red jellybeans as R.

We are given that G = 17 and R = 2G. The total number of jellybeans is 60, so we can express this as an equation: B + G + R = 60.

Substituting the given values for G and R, we get B + 17 + 2(17) = 60.

Simplifying the equation, we have B + 17 + 34 = 60.

Combining like terms, we get B + 51 = 60.

To isolate B, we subtract 51 from both sides of the equation: B = 60 - 51.

Therefore, B = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Given that Tim grows 5 trees and each tree yields 6 lemons per year, we can calculate the annual lemon production as follows:

Let T represent the number of trees (T = 5) and L represent the number of lemons per tree per year (L = 6). The annual lemon production can be expressed as:

Annual Lemon Production = T × L
= 5 × 6
= 30 lemons/year

To find the total number of lemons collected in a decade, we multiply the annual production by the number of years in a decade (n = 10):

Total Lemons in a Decade = Annual Lemon Production × n
= 30 lemons/year × 10 years
= 300 lemons

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade is 300."
"Given the ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9, we can express the total number of passengers as a sum of the parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 9 = 14. The fraction of women on the bus is then 9/14.

To find the number of women on the bus, we can use the proportion:

Number of women = (Fraction of women) × Total number of passengers
= (9/14) × 84
= (9/14) × (84/1)
= (9 × 84) / (14 × 1)
= 756 / 14
= 54

Now, we need to find the number of women who remained on the bus after 20 women alighted. This can be calculated as:

Number of women remained = Initial number of women - Number of women alighted
= 54 - 20
= 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the total number of sunflowers sold by Faraday, we need to calculate the number of sunflowers sold from individual sales and bouquet sales separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold from individual sales. We know that Faraday earns $26 from individual sunflower sales per day and each sunflower costs $2. We can use the following equation to find the number of sunflowers sold per day:

Number of sunflowers sold per day = Total daily revenue from individual sunflowers / Price per sunflower
= $26 / $2
= 13 sunflowers per day

Next, we need to calculate the number of sunflowers sold from bouquet sales. We know that Faraday earns $56 from bouquet sales per day and each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers. We can use the following equation to find the number of bouquets sold per day:

Number of bouquets sold per day = Total daily revenue from bouquets / Price per bouquet
= $56 / $8
= 7 bouquets per day

Now, we can find the number of sunflowers sold from bouquet sales by multiplying the number of bouquets sold per day by the number of sunflowers per bouquet:

Number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day = Number of bouquets sold per day * Number of sunflowers per bouquet
= 7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet
= 84 sunflowers/day

To find the total number of sunflowers sold per day, we add the number of sunflowers sold from individual sales and bouquet sales:

Total sunflowers sold per day = Number of sunflowers sold from individual sales per day + Number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day
= 13 sunflowers/day + 84 sunflowers/day
= 97 sunflowers/day

Finally, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days by multiplying the total number of sunflowers sold per day by the number of days:

Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = Total sunflowers sold per day * Number of days
= 97 sunflowers/day * 3 days
= 291 sunflowers

The final answer is: $\boxed{291}$"
"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he purchases, the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory, and then find the difference between the two.

Let's denote the number of rocks Adam can buy as $n$. Given that he has $100 to invest and each rock costs $5, we can express this as an equation:

$$100 = 5n$$

Solving for $n$, we get:

$$n = \frac{100}{5} = 20$$

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks:

$$\text{Number of rocks sold} = 0.6 \times 20 = 12$$

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

$$\text{Revenue} = 12 \times 7 = 84$$

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:

$$\text{Total cost} = 20 \times 5 = 100$$

However, since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

$$\text{Cost of unsold rocks} = 8 \times 5 = 40$$

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$$\text{Total cost} = 100 + 40 = 140$$

To find out how much money Adam loses, we subtract the revenue from the total cost:

$$\text{Loss} = 140 - 84 = 56$$

The final answer is: $56"
"To determine the minimum number of days required for Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days it will take her to complete each type of picture scene and then find the maximum of these values.

Let's denote the number of days required to complete large-sized, medium-sized, and small-sized picture scenes as $L$, $M$, and $S$, respectively. We can express these values as follows:

$$L = \frac{45}{5} = 9$$

$$M = \frac{36}{6} = 6$$

$$S = \frac{49}{7} = 7$$

Since Lauren can only work on one type of picture scene per day, the total number of days required to complete the project is the maximum of $L$, $M$, and $S$. Therefore, the minimum number of days required to complete the project is $\max(L, M, S) = \max(9, 6, 7) = 9$ days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of eggs each child receives, we must first calculate the total number of eggs Chatty prepared. Since a dozen is equivalent to 12, three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Given that each child receives an equal number of eggs, we can find the number of eggs per child by dividing the total number of eggs by the number of children. In this case, there are 4 children.

Therefore, the number of eggs per child is calculated as follows:

36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs per child.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the total cost of food for Jen's fish in May, we must first calculate the daily expenditure. Given that each fish requires $1 worth of food per day, and Jen has 3 fish, the daily cost is $3. 

Since May has 31 days, we can calculate the total monthly cost by multiplying the daily cost by the number of days in the month: $3/day * 31 days = $93.

Therefore, the total cost of food for Jen's fish in May is $93.

"To determine the current number of roses Patricia possesses, we must first account for the roses she gave away and then incorporate the additional roses she acquired.

Let's denote the initial number of roses as I = 30. The number of roses given away is denoted as G = 24. The number of roses purchased is denoted as P = 15.

The number of roses remaining after giving away 24 roses is calculated as I - G = 30 - 24 = 6.

Subsequently, Patricia purchased 15 more roses. To find the total number of roses she now possesses, we add the remaining roses to the number of roses purchased: 6 + 15 = 21.

Therefore, Patricia currently has 21 roses.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine Sid's average speed, we must first calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The total distance is the sum of the distances traveled in each segment, which is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles. The total time is the sum of the times taken for each segment, which is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

The average speed is calculated using the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time. Substituting the values, we get:

Average Speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average Speed = 50 miles per hour

Therefore, Sid's average speed is 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we must first understand the individual probabilities of each ticket winning. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: $p_1 = 0.2$. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is $p_2 = 3p_1 = 3(0.2) = 0.6$.

The probability of both tickets winning is the product of their individual probabilities, given that the events are independent. Therefore, the probability of both tickets winning is $p_{\text{both}} = p_1 \cdot p_2 = 0.2 \cdot 0.6 = 0.12$.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: $p_{\text{both}} = 0.12 \cdot 100 = 12\%$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a systematic approach by first establishing the relationships between the number of seashells collected by each individual. Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carrey as R, Carlos as C, and Jim as J.

From the given information, we know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, which can be expressed as J = C + 5. We are also told that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so C = 2R.

Given that Jim collected 27 seashells, we can substitute this value into the equation J = C + 5 to find the value of C. This yields 27 = C + 5, which simplifies to C = 22.

Now that we have the value of C, we can use the equation C = 2R to solve for R. Substituting C = 22 into this equation gives us 22 = 2R, which simplifies to R = 11.

We now have the values of R, C, and J: R = 11, C = 22, and J = 27. To find the total number of seashells collected, we sum these values: 11 + 22 + 27 = 60.

Finally, to determine the number of seashells each person gets when they divide the total number of seashells equally among themselves, we divide the total by 3: 60 ÷ 3 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of carrots Mason consumes on weekdays. Since he eats 4 carrots each day for 5 days, we can express this as a product of the number of carrots eaten per day and the number of days:

4 carrots/day × 5 days = 20 carrots

Next, we calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats on the weekend. He consumes 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, which can be expressed as:

5 carrots/day × 2 days = 10 carrots

To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we sum the total number of carrots consumed on weekdays and the weekend:

20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekend) = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats a total of 30 carrots in a week.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total time of the cassette, we first need to calculate the length of the second song. Given that it is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes, we can express this relationship as an equation.

Let x be the length of the second song. Then, we can write the equation as:

x = 5 + (0.6)(5)

To solve for x, we can distribute the 0.6 to the 5, which yields:

x = 5 + 3
x = 8

Therefore, the second song is 8 minutes long. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

Total time = 5 + 8
Total time = 13 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the total profit earned by Linus from selling the mobile devices, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then sum them together.

Let's denote the cost price of a single device as CP and the selling price as SP. Given that Linus buys the devices for $20 and sells them for twice the original price, we have CP = $20 and SP = 2 * CP = 2 * $20 = $40.

On Monday, Linus purchased 2 devices, so the total cost price is 2 * CP = 2 * $20 = $40. The total selling price for Monday is 2 * SP = 2 * $40 = $80. Therefore, the profit for Monday is SP - CP = $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices, so the total cost price is 4 * CP = 4 * $20 = $80. The total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * SP = 4 * $40 = $160. Consequently, the profit for Tuesday is SP - CP = $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Given the problem, we can establish a series of linear equations to determine the length of Carl's cane. Let's denote the height of Isabel as I, the height of Ned as N, and the height of Carl as C. We are given the following information:

1. I = 7 feet (Isabel's height)
2. N = I - 2 (Ned's height is 2 feet shorter than Isabel's)
3. C = N + 1 (Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned)
4. Cane's length = C / 2 (the cane is half as long as Carl's height)

From equation 2, we can substitute the value of I into the equation to find N:
N = 7 - 2
N = 5 feet

From equation 3, we can substitute the value of N into the equation to find C:
C = 5 + 1
C = 6 feet

Now, we can use equation 4 to find the length of Carl's cane:
Cane's length = C / 2
Cane's length = 6 / 2
Cane's length = 3 feet

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet.

"To determine the number of additional bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to meet the energy demands of the entire population.

Given that each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the number of bottles needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand as follows:

Let x be the number of bottles needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand. Then, 20% of x is equal to 1 (since 20% of x covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand). We can express this as:

0.20x = 1

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.20:

x = 1 / 0.20
x = 5

Therefore, 5 bottles are needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand.

Now, to find the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we multiply the number of bottles needed for one person by the total population:

Total bottles required = 5 bottles/person * 2300 people
Total bottles required = 11500 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we can calculate the number of additional bottles needed as follows:

Additional bottles needed = Total bottles required - Current production
Additional bottles needed = 11500 - 4200
Additional bottles needed = 7300

The final answer is: $\boxed{7300}$"
"To determine the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we can employ a Venn diagram or a probability approach. Let's consider the total number of babies as 8, with 3/4 of them wearing purple and 1/4 wearing blue.

Number of babies wearing purple: $\frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6$
Number of babies wearing blue: $\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2$

We are given that 1/3 of the purple-wearers also wear bows. Therefore, the number of babies wearing purple and bows is $\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2$. Additionally, all 2 babies wearing blue also wear bows.

Total number of babies wearing bows: $2 + 2 = 4$

Now, we can calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple as the ratio of the number of babies wearing purple and bows to the total number of babies wearing bows:

$\frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5$

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

$0.5 \times 100 = 50\%$

Therefore, the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of tax reports received by the IRS on Wednesday, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday as M + T, and the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday as T + F. We are given that the total number of reports received last week is 5168, and the sum of reports received on Monday and Tuesday is 1907, while the sum of reports received on Thursday and Friday is 2136.

We can express this information as a system of equations:

M + T = 1907  ... (Equation 1)
T + F = 2136  ... (Equation 2)
M + T + T + F = 5168  ... (Equation 3)

Simplifying Equation 3 by combining like terms, we get:
M + 2T + F = 5168

Now, we can substitute the values of M + T and T + F from Equations 1 and 2 into the simplified Equation 3:
1907 + 2T + 2136 = 5168

Combine the constants on the left-hand side:
4043 + 2T = 5168

Subtract 4043 from both sides:
2T = 1125

Divide both sides by 2:
T = 562.5

Now that we have the value of T, we can find the number of reports received on Wednesday, which is the difference between the total number of reports received last week and the sum of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the sum of reports received on Thursday and Friday. However, we can also find the number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the sum of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the sum of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtracting the result from the total number of reports received last week.

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The final answer is: $\boxed{1125}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to calculate the revenue generated from each sale and sum them up.

Let's start by calculating the area of land sold in the first transaction. Since Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50, we can express this as:

$$\frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ square meters}$$

The revenue from the first sale is $50.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. The area of land sold in the second transaction is:

$$\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \text{ square meters}$$

The revenue from the second sale is $30.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. The revenue from the third sale is:

$$20 \times 3 = 60$$

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. We add the revenues from the three sales:

$$50 + 30 + 60 = 140$$

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling all his unused land is $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To determine Geb's age, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Haley's age as H and Geb's age as G. We are given that G = H - 10 and H = 26.

Substituting the value of H into the equation G = H - 10, we get G = 26 - 10.

G = 26 - 10
G = 16

Therefore, Geb is 16 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the total number of face masks he uses in a day and then multiply it by 2.

Given that Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day can be calculated as follows:

Face masks used per day = Number of times face mask is changed per outing × Number of outings per day
= 2 × 3
= 6

Now, to find the total number of face masks used every 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks used per day by 2:

Total face masks used every 2 days = Face masks used per day × 2
= 6 × 2
= 12

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we can approach this problem by first calculating the total number of eggs found by each individual and then subtracting that from the initial number of eggs hidden.

Let's denote the number of eggs found by Lamar as L, Stacy as S, Charlie as C, and Mei as M. We are given the following relationships:

- L = 5
- S = 2L = 2(5) = 10
- C = S - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8
- M = C/2 = 8/2 = 4

Now, we can calculate the total number of eggs found by adding the individual counts: L + S + C + M = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27.

Given that Cole initially hid 3 dozen eggs, we can convert this to a numerical value: 3 dozen = 3 × 12 = 36 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9.

The final numerical answer is: 9"
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we must first calculate the total number of apartments he collects from. The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 2 \* 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% larger than this combined total, which can be expressed as 1.6 \* 400 = 640 apartments. Therefore, the total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, the total number of collections per week is 3 \* 1040 = 3120 collections.

Given that he gets paid $0.40 per collection, his weekly earnings can be calculated as 3120 \* 0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To determine the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10-year lifespan, we can analyze the given information and apply mathematical principles to derive the solution.

Let's denote the initial number of fruits produced by a 5-year-old tree as $F$. According to the problem statement, a 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is $3F$. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, resulting in $7F$ fruits. 

We are also given that an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let's denote the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree as $x$. Therefore, the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree is $x - 200$.

The problem also states that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is $20F$. Since we know that a 10-year-old tree produces $x$ fruits, we can equate these two expressions to find the value of $x$:

$$20F = x$$

We are also given that a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits. Therefore, we can substitute this value for $x$ in the equation above:

$$20F = 1000$$

Solving for $F$, we get:

$$F = \frac{1000}{20} = 50$$

Now that we have the value of $F$, we can find the number of fruits produced by each age of the tree:

- Year 1 (5 years old): $F = 50$ fruits
- Year 2 (6 years old): $3F = 3 \cdot 50 = 150$ fruits
- Year 3 (7 years old): $7F = 7 \cdot 50 = 350$ fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): $x - 200 = 1000 - 200 = 800$ fruits
- Year 5 (9 years old): $0$ fruits (no production)
- Year 6 (10 years old): $x = 1000$ fruits

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Total Fruits} &= F + 3F + 7F + (x - 200) + 0 + x \\
&= 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 \\
&= 2350
\end{aligned}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{2350}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jack has after Sophia gives him 1/5 of her $100, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic operation.

First, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100. This can be expressed as a fraction: $\frac{1}{5} \times 100$. To simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator by the denominator: $\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = \frac{1 \times 100}{5} = \frac{100}{5} = 20$.

Now, we add this amount to Jack's initial $100: $100 + 20 = $120.

Therefore, Jack now has $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the lengths of the three ropes. Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R.

Given that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, we can express this relationship as R = 4B. Additionally, we know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, which can be represented as B = Y - 7.

We are also given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, which can be expressed as R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we obtain 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's analyze the problem using algebraic equations.

Let's denote the amount of money Ronnie was given as $5 as 'R' and the amount Rissa was given as '3R' since she received thrice as much. After each of them gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, the amount left with Ronnie is R - x and the amount left with Rissa is 3R - x, where 'x' is the amount given to their little sister.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, which can be expressed as:

3R - x = (4/5)(3R)

Simplifying the equation:

3R - x = 12R/5

Multiplying both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

15R - 5x = 12R

Subtracting 12R from both sides:

3R - 5x = 0

Subtracting 3R from both sides:

-5x = -3R

Dividing both sides by -5:

x = 3R/5

Now, we know that x is 3/5 of Rissa's original amount, which is 3/5 of 3R. Since Ronnie was given $5, we can set up the equation:

R = 5

Substituting R = 5 into the equation x = 3R/5:

x = 3(5)/5
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with:

R - x = 5 - 3
= 2

The final answer is: $2"
"Given the problem, we can approach it by first recognizing that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. This implies that the other half, which consists of red, white, and purple paint, is also 6 pints. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can denote the amount of each as x. Therefore, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:

$$
3x = 6 \\
\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{6}{3} \\
x = 2
$$

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total area of Tom's house, we must first calculate the area of each component and then sum them. 

The area of a rectangle, such as a bedroom, is given by the product of its length and width. In this case, each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so its area is $A_{bedroom} = 20 \times 12 = 240$ square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is $A_{bedrooms} = 4 \times A_{bedroom} = 4 \times 240 = 960$ square feet.

The living room is stated to be 5 times larger than a bedroom, so its area is $A_{living\ room} = 5 \times A_{bedroom} = 5 \times 240 = 1200$ square feet.

The remaining area of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we sum the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area: $A_{total} = A_{bedrooms} + A_{living\ room} + A_{remaining} = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160$ square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3160}$"
"To determine the total number of clouds Alice counted over the five-day period, we can employ a geometric progression formula. A geometric progression is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.

In this scenario, the first term (a) is 3, and the common ratio (r) is 2, as the number of clouds doubles each day. The formula to find the nth term of a geometric progression is given by:

an = a * r^(n-1)

We want to find the sum of the first five terms (n = 5), so we can use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum of the series, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
= 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1)
= 3 * (-31) / (-1)
= 3 * 31
= 93

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice counted over the five-day period is 93.

The final answer is: 93"
"To determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box for $1, we first need to calculate the number of pods in the new box. Given that the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can express this as a mathematical relationship.

Let's denote the number of pods in the regular box as $n$. The new box has 20% more pods, which can be represented as $n + 0.2n = 1.2n$. We are given that the regular box contains 100 pods, so we can set up the equation:

$n + 0.2n = 100$

Solving for $n$, we get:

$1.2n = 100$
$n = \frac{100}{1.2}$
$n = 83.33$

However, this is the number of pods in the regular box. To find the number of pods in the new box, we multiply the number of pods in the regular box by 1.2:

$1.2n = 1.2(83.33) = 100$

So, the new box contains 100 pods.

Now, we can determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box for $1. Since each cycle requires one pod, we can divide the total number of pods in the new box by the cost of the new box ($12) and then by the cost of one cycle ($1):

$\frac{100}{12} \div 1 = \frac{100}{12}$

To simplify this expression, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

$\frac{100}{12} = \frac{25}{3}$

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box for $1 is $\frac{25}{3}$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{25}{3}}$"
"To solve this problem, we can apply a step-by-step approach, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and logical reasoning.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This implies that he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

Upon losing 10 bills during transit, the number of remaining bills is 50 - 10 = 40.

Subsequently, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is equivalent to 40 / 2 = 20 bills. Consequently, he is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Next, he triples his money, which is equivalent to tripling the number of bills. Therefore, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

The final numerical answer is: $300"
"To determine the total number of goals scored in the soccer match, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first half and the second half.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, which implies that team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 \* 2 = 8 goals. This is a direct consequence of the fact that team B's scoring rate in the second half is a multiple of its scoring rate in the first half. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 \* 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is the sum of its goals in the first and second halves, which is 4 + 2 = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is the sum of its goals in the first and second halves, which is 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by team A and team B, which is 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we can model this situation using a linear equation. Let's denote the number of days as 'x'. The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk and uses 20% of it each day. However, on Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, leaving 55% of the original 5 inches.

The remaining chalk can be calculated as follows:

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find the number of days 'x' such that the remaining chalk is less than 2 inches. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of the remaining chalk.

Let's set up the equation:

Initial chalk = 5 inches
Chalk used on Monday = 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches
Remaining chalk after Monday = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of the remaining chalk, which is 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day.

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the inequality:

0.55x ≤ 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x ≤ 2.75 / 0.55
x ≤ 5

Since 'x' represents the number of days, it must be a positive integer. Therefore, the teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of students on varsity. 

Given that one-third of the girls are on varsity, we can express this as $\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4$ girls on varsity. Similarly, one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, which can be represented as $\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3$ boys on varsity.

The total number of students on varsity is the sum of the girls and boys on varsity, which is $4 + 3 = 7$.

The total number of students in the class is the sum of the boys and girls, which is $12 + 12 = 24$.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students: $24 - 7 = 17$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of face masks Johnny bought, we can establish a mathematical relationship between the quantities purchased by Mike and Johnny. Let's denote the number of face masks Mike bought as M and the number of face masks Johnny bought as J.

Given that Mike bought 5 face masks, we have M = 5.

It is also stated that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. This can be expressed as J = 3M + 2.

Substituting the value of M into the equation for J, we get J = 3(5) + 2.

Using the distributive property of multiplication, we can simplify this expression to J = 15 + 2.

Performing the addition, we find that J = 17.

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the total number of teeth the dentist treats and then express it as a proportion of the total number of teeth James has.

The dentist drills 4 teeth, which is a straightforward count. However, the dentist also caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth the dentist caps is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth he drills and caps, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we can use the formula:

Percentage = (Number of teeth fixed / Total number of teeth) × 100

Substituting the values, we get:

Percentage = (15 / 30) × 100

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 15:

Percentage = (1 / 2) × 100

Now, we can evaluate the expression:

Percentage = 0.5 × 100
= 50%

Therefore, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus is eligible for a refund, we need to calculate the quantity of milk that has expired. Given that 2/5 of the 4000 gallons of milk sold to him have passed the expiry date, we can compute this as follows:

Let's denote the total quantity of milk sold as Q = 4000 gallons. The fraction of milk that has expired is 2/5. Therefore, the quantity of expired milk is:

Q_expired = (2/5) * Q = (2/5) * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons

Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the total refund will be the cost per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons returned:

Refund = Q_expired * Cost_per_gallon = 1600 * 3.5 = 5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C. We can express the given information as a system of linear equations.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

Therefore, Colin's current age is 20 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of books Bob can purchase for each school, we first need to calculate the total number of books he can buy with his allocated funds. Given that he has $27,000 and can purchase 100 books for $500, we can establish the cost per book as follows:

Cost per book = $500 / 100 books
Cost per book = $5

Now, we can calculate the total number of books Bob can purchase with his funds:

Total books = Total money / Cost per book
Total books = $27,000 / $5
Total books = 5,400

Since Bob is distributing the funds to 3 schools, we can determine the number of books he can purchase for each school by dividing the total number of books by the number of schools:

Books per school = Total books / Number of schools
Books per school = 5,400 / 3
Books per school = 1,800

Therefore, Bob can purchase 1,800 books for each school.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1800}$"
"Let's analyze the situation using a systematic approach.

Initially, we have 2 apples that fell out of the tree. Newton picks up these 2 apples, putting 1 in his pocket and throwing the other back into the tree. This action results in 5 additional apples falling out of the tree. Therefore, the total number of apples he has at this point is 1 (in pocket) + 5 (new) = 6.

Next, he puts all but 1 of the new apples in his pocket, leaving 1 apple outside. The number of apples in his pocket is now 5 (from the previous step) + 4 (new, since he put 1 back outside) = 9. The total number of apples he has at this point is 1 (outside) + 9 (in pocket) = 10.

Then, he throws the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. This results in a total of 10 (from the previous step) + 6 (new) = 16 apples.

Finally, he picks up all the remaining apples, which is the total of 16 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 16 apples."
"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we must first calculate the number of 50 kg bags required to meet the 850 kg demand. This can be achieved by dividing the total weight of coal by the weight per bag.

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Given that each bag costs $18, we can now calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag.

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 * $18
= $306

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will consume. Given that each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, and there are 6 friends, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 friends * 6 slices/friend = 36 slices. Similarly, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices.

To find the number of cheese pizzas needed, we divide the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten (36) by the number of slices per pizza (12), which yields 36 ÷ 12 = 3. Likewise, to find the number of pepperoni pizzas needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten (24) by the number of slices per pizza (8), resulting in 24 ÷ 8 = 3.

Since Kate requires 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to purchase is 3 + 3 = 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total miles Sam ran this week, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the miles run on each day and then summing the results.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. This can be represented as 3 miles/day * 3 days = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. This can be represented as 5 miles/day * 2 days = 10 miles.

To find the total miles run, we add the miles from both sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

Therefore, the total miles Sam ran this week is 19 miles."
"To determine the time it will take Jay to accumulate 60 snowballs, we must consider the rates at which he builds and loses snowballs. 

Let's denote the rate at which Jay builds snowballs as $b$ and the rate at which they melt as $m$. Given that Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, we can express his building rate as $b = \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3}$ snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so the melting rate is $m = \frac{2}{15}$ snowballs per minute.

The net rate of snowball accumulation is the difference between the building and melting rates: $r = b - m = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{5}{15} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5}$ snowballs per minute.

To find the time required to accumulate 60 snowballs, we can use the formula $t = \frac{n}{r}$, where $n$ is the number of snowballs and $r$ is the net rate of accumulation.

Plugging in the values, we get $t = \frac{60}{\frac{1}{5}} = 60 \times 5 = 300$ minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to accumulate 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine Jim's current age, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Jim's age 20 years ago as 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can express John's age 20 years ago as 2x.

We are given that John is currently 28 years old. Therefore, 20 years ago, John's age would be 28 - 20 = 8 years. This allows us to form the equation 2x = 8, where x represents Jim's age 20 years ago.

Solving for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2, yielding x = 4. This means Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago.

To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age 20 years ago: x + 20 = 4 + 20 = 24.

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple arithmetic progression to determine the number of slices each person ate. Let's denote the number of slices Doxa ate as x. Since her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, her sister ate x + 1 slices. Similarly, her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so he ate x + 2 slices.

We are given that Doxa ate 1 slice, so we can set up the equation x = 1. 

Now, we can find the number of slices her sister and brother ate by substituting x = 1 into the expressions for their slices: 
- Her sister ate x + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
- Her brother ate x + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add up the number of slices each person ate: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to model the situation. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages. Therefore, the number of bandages remaining after the first day is x - 38 + 50.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The number of bandages remaining after the second day is (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The number of bandages remaining after the third day is ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides, we get:

x = 21

Therefore, the initial number of bandages is 21.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the total cost of May's haircut and color treatment, we must first calculate the difference in length and then multiply it by the cost per inch. 

Let's denote the initial length of May's hair as $L_i$ and the final length as $L_f$. The difference in length, $\Delta L$, is given by:

$\Delta L = L_i - L_f$

Given that the initial length is 10 inches and the final length is 8 inches, we can substitute these values into the equation:

$\Delta L = 10 - 8 = 2$ inches

The cost per inch of haircut is $30. Therefore, the cost of the haircut for the 2-inch difference is:

$C_{haircut} = \Delta L \times 30 = 2 \times 30 = 60$

In addition to the haircut, May also incurred a cost for the color treatment, which is $40.

The total cost, $C_{total}$, is the sum of the haircut cost and the color treatment cost:

$C_{total} = C_{haircut} + C_{color} = 60 + 40 = 100$

Therefore, the total cost of May's haircut and color treatment is $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate her regular pay and attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. Given that Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April, we can calculate her total hours worked in April as follows:

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks
Total hours worked in April = 7.5 * 6 * 4
Total hours worked in April = 180 hours

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular pay is:

Regular pay = Total hours worked in April * Hourly rate
Regular pay = 180 hours * $1.5/hour
Regular pay = $270

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus. Since Jen receives an additional $10 for each day she has complete attendance and she has no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 24 days.

Attendance bonus = $10/day * 24 days
Attendance bonus = $240

Now, let's add her regular pay and attendance bonus to find her total earnings:

Total earnings = Regular pay + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $240
Total earnings = $510

The final answer is: $510"
"To determine the total earnings of Jason, we can calculate the compensation for each task and then sum the results.

Let's denote the earnings for each task as follows:
- Laundry: $3.00
- Cleaning the room: $1.50
- Taking the trash out: $0.75
- Emptying the dishwasher: $0.50

We are given that Jason performed each task a specific number of times:
- Laundry: 1 time
- Cleaning the room: 1 time
- Taking the trash out: 2 times
- Emptying the dishwasher: 6 times

We can calculate the total earnings for each task by multiplying the earnings per task by the number of times it was performed:
- Laundry: $3.00 * 1 = $3.00
- Cleaning the room: $1.50 * 1 = $1.50
- Taking the trash out: $0.75 * 2 = $1.50
- Emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

Now, we can sum the total earnings for each task to find the overall earnings:
$3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To determine the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we must first establish the blood volume of a single shark. Given that a whale has 40 gallons of blood and a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, we can calculate the blood volume of a shark as follows:

Blood volume of a shark = 3 × Blood volume of a whale
= 3 × 40 gallons
= 120 gallons

Now, to find the total blood volume of ten sharks, we can multiply the blood volume of a single shark by the number of sharks:

Total blood volume of ten sharks = Blood volume of a shark × Number of sharks
= 120 gallons/shark × 10 sharks
= 1200 gallons

Therefore, the total amount of blood in ten sharks is 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1200}$"
"To determine the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we can break down the problem into distinct segments based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of people who entered in the morning as $M$, the number of people who entered at 10:00 as $T$, and the number of people who entered in the evening as $E$.

We are given that $M = 50$ and $T = 40$. We also know that the number of people who entered for lunch is twice the number of people who entered at 10:00, which can be expressed as $L = 2T = 2(40) = 80$.

Furthermore, we are told that the number of people who entered in the evening is three times the number of people who entered in the morning, which can be written as $E = 3M = 3(50) = 150$.

To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we can add up the number of people who entered at each time: $M + T + L + E = 50 + 40 + 80 + 150$.

Now, let's perform the arithmetic operation to find the total number of people who entered the restaurant:
$50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320$

The final answer is: $\boxed{320}$"
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and the number of black pens.

First, we know that Alain's mom purchased 5 packs of red pens. Given that each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Furthermore, we are informed that Alain's mom acquired twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the total expenditure, we must first calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately, and then sum them.

Let's denote the cost of a bottle of scotch as $s. Given that John purchases 10 bottles of scotch for a total of $600, we can express this as:

10s = 600

Solving for s, we find that the cost of a bottle of scotch is s = 600 / 10 = $60.

Next, we are told that John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, which is 2 * 10 = 20 bottles. The cost of a bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost of a bottle of scotch, which can be expressed as:

cognac = s + (s * 0.5)
cognac = 60 + (60 * 0.5)
cognac = 60 + 30
cognac = $90

The total cost of the cognac is then 20 * 90 = $1800.

To find the total expenditure, we sum the cost of the scotch and the cognac:

Total expenditure = 600 + 1800
Total expenditure = $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To determine the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we can break down the problem into two components: the number of White Oak trees and the number of Lodgepole Pine trees.

Let's denote the number of White Oak trees planted on the first day as $W_1$ and the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day as $P_1$. We are given that $W_1 = 20$ and $P_1 = 2W_1 = 40$.

On the second day, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees planted over the two days is $W_1 + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30$. Similarly, he planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is $P_1 + \frac{1}{4}P_1 = \frac{5}{4}P_1 = \frac{5}{4} \cdot 40 = 50$.

Now, we can calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius over the two days by adding the total number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees:

Total number of trees = $W_1 + W_2 + P_1 + P_2 = 30 + 90 = 120$

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the amount of root beer available for each person to drink at the party, we must first calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after the various incidents. 

Let's denote the initial amount of root beer as $R_0 = 24$ gallons. On the first day, 4 gallons were stolen by Fred's children, so the remaining amount is $R_1 = R_0 - 4 = 20$ gallons.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, resulting in a new remaining amount of $R_2 = R_1 - 7 = 13$ gallons.

On the third day, 5 gallons were taken by Ronnie, leaving $R_3 = R_2 - 5 = 8$ gallons.

Now, we need to determine the amount of root beer each person will receive at the party. Since 3 people showed up for the party, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people: $\frac{R_3}{3} = \frac{8}{3} = 2\frac{2}{3}$ gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ basic algebraic techniques to isolate the variable representing the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge. The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is equal to 40. This can be expressed as the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation, which yields:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we can express this as a fraction:

$$\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = \frac{66}{3} = 22$$

Next, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish:

$$66 - 22 = 44$$

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. We are given that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. To calculate this, we can multiply the number of fish without red stripes by 5/11:

$$\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = \frac{5 \times 44}{11} = \frac{220}{11} = 20$$

Finally, we can find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes by adding the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

$$22 + 20 = 42$$

Therefore, the total number of fish with red and blue stripes is 42.

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"To determine the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to consider the initial number of eyeshadow colors she possessed and the subsequent changes to that quantity.

Initially, Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, resulting in a total of 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes. Additionally, she had three makeup sets, each containing six eyeshadow colors, contributing a total of 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets. Therefore, Amy's initial total number of eyeshadow colors is 8 + 18 = 26.

Following the loss of one eyeshadow palette, Amy's total number of eyeshadow colors decreased by 4, resulting in 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.

Subsequently, Amy used half of the colors from one makeup set, which contained 6 eyeshadow colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used 3 eyeshadow colors. Consequently, Amy's remaining eyeshadow colors are 22 - 3 = 19.

The final numerical answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"Given the problem, we can break it down into manageable components to determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor.

Let's denote Mattison's height as $M$, the height of the two-story house as $H$, and the height of the first floor as $F$. We are given that $M = 60$ inches.

From the problem statement, we know that the two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so we can express this relationship as:

$$H = 7M = 7(60) = 420 \text{ inches}$$

Additionally, we are told that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, which gives us:

$$F = 3M = 3(60) = 180 \text{ inches}$$

Now, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:

$$\text{Height of the second floor} = H - F = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches}$$

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to determine the height of the second floor to the ceiling, which is the difference between the total height of the house and the height of the second floor:

$$\text{Height of the roof from the second floor's floor} = H - (H - F) = H - 240 = 420 - 240 = 180 \text{ inches}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas, which is 40% of the total shells.

Let's denote the total number of shells as $T$. Then, the number of shells found by team Alphas is $0.4T$.

We are given that $T = 700$, so the number of shells found by team Alphas is $0.4 \times 700 = 280$ shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas has found their share. This can be calculated as $T - 0.4T = 0.6T$.

Substituting the value of $T$, we get $0.6 \times 700 = 420$ shells remaining.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

The number of shells found by team The finders is $0.6 \times 420 = 252$ shells.

Finally, we can find the number of shells found by team Gogetters by subtracting the total number of shells found by teams Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells.

The number of shells found by team Gogetters is $T - (0.4T + 0.6T) = 0.0T = 0T$.

"To determine the miles walked by the last dog, we can utilize the concept of averages and total distances. Let's denote the miles walked by the first three dogs as $d_1$, $d_2$, and $d_3$, and the miles walked by the last dog as $d_4$. We are given that the average miles walked by all four dogs is 3 miles per day, which can be expressed as:

$$\frac{d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4}{4} = 3$$

We are also given the individual miles walked by the first three dogs: $d_1 = 1$, $d_2 = 4$, and $d_3 = 3$. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

$$\frac{1 + 4 + 3 + d_4}{4} = 3$$

Simplifying the equation, we have:

$$\frac{8 + d_4}{4} = 3$$

Multiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

$$8 + d_4 = 12$$

Subtracting 8 from both sides to isolate $d_4$, we find:

$$d_4 = 4$$

Therefore, the last dog needs 4 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts, we need to calculate the loan amount and then subtract the amount used to pay off his debts.

First, we calculate the loan amount, which is 40% of the value of his house.

Loan Amount = 0.4 × $250,000 = $100,000

Next, we calculate the amount used to pay off his debts, which is 60% of the loan amount.

Amount used to pay off debts = 0.6 × $100,000 = $60,000

Now, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount to find the leftover amount.

Leftover Amount = Loan Amount - Amount used to pay off debts
= $100,000 - $60,000
= $40,000

Therefore, John had $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To determine Deandre's total earnings from selling the tunas, we need to calculate the total weight of the tunas and then multiply it by the cost per kilogram.

The weights of the three tunas are given as 56 kilograms, 46 kilograms, and 26 kilograms. To find the total weight, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Total weight = 56 + 46 + 26

However, since this is a simple arithmetic series with three terms, we can also use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Total weight = (n/2) * (a1 + an)

where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, n = 3, a1 = 56, and an = 26. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Total weight = (3/2) * (56 + 26)
Total weight = (3/2) * 82
Total weight = 1.5 * 82
Total weight = 123 kilograms

Alternatively, we can simply add the weights of the three tunas:

Total weight = 56 + 46 + 26
Total weight = 128 kilograms

However, the correct total weight is 123 kilograms, as calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

Now, to find Deandre's total earnings, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram:

Total earnings = Total weight * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 123 * 0.50
Total earnings = 61.50

The final answer is: $61.50"
"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the magazines, which is 11/8 of the cost price. 

Given that the cost price is $72, we can express the selling price as a mathematical expression:

Selling price = (11/8) × 72

To simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by 72:

Selling price = (11 × 72) / (8 × 1)
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27.

The final answer is: $27"
"To determine the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement, we need to calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then sum these values.

Let's denote the amount of water removed per day on the low setting as L. Given that the medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, the amount of water removed per day on the medium setting is 2L. Similarly, the high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so the amount of water removed per day on the high setting is 2(2L) = 4L.

Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, so the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 3L. For the medium setting, he ran it for 3 days, resulting in a total of 3(2L) = 6L. Lastly, he ran the high setting for 5 days, which yields a total of 5(4L) = 20L.

To find the total amount of water removed, we sum the individual totals: 3L + 6L + 20L = 29L.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the number of balloons thrown during the water balloon fight, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic operation. 

First, we calculate the total number of balloons available: 10 packs of balloons, each containing 30 balloons, yields a total of $10 \times 30 = 300$ balloons.

Next, we subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon from the total number of balloons to obtain the number of balloons thrown: $300 - 12 = 288$.

Therefore, the number of balloons thrown during the water balloon fight is 288."
"To determine the total volume of medicine in 8 doses, we first need to calculate the volume of each component in one dose. The first medicine is 14 mL, and the second medicine is 3 times that amount, which is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

The total volume of one dose is the sum of the volumes of the two medicines, which is 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

To find the total volume of 8 doses, we multiply the volume of one dose by 8:

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

Therefore, the total volume of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL.

The final answer is: $\boxed{448}$"
"To determine the combined capacity of both schools, we must first calculate the capacity of John's classes. Given that each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can express this as a mathematical relationship:

Let A represent the capacity of Ali's class, and J represent the capacity of John's classes. We are given that A = 120 students. The capacity of each of John's classes is 1/8 of A, which can be expressed as:

J = (1/8)A

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his classes is 2J. Substituting the expression for J, we get:

2J = 2 * (1/8)A
2J = (1/4)A

Now, we can substitute the value of A into this equation to find the total capacity of John's classes:

2J = (1/4) * 120
2J = 30

J = 15

Therefore, the capacity of each of John's classes is 15 students. The total capacity of John's classes is 2J = 2 * 15 = 30 students.

To find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacity of Ali's class to the capacity of John's classes:

Combined capacity = A + 2J
= 120 + 30
= 150

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the total interest he owes his sister and subtract the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months.

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which can be calculated as:

I = P * r * t

where I is the interest, P is the principal amount ($300), r is the interest rate (2% or 0.02), and t is the time period (1 year or 12 months). However, since Stephen will pay the interest over 12 months, we can also express the interest as:

I = P * r

I = 300 * 0.02
I = 6

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is:

A = PMT * n
where A is the total amount, PMT is the monthly payment ($25), and n is the number of payments (11).

A = 25 * 11
A = 275

The remaining amount, including the interest, that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the initial amount plus the interest minus the amount he paid in the first 11 months:

A12 = P + I - A
A12 = 300 + 6 - 275
A12 = 31

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine the number of diapers Jordan changes per day, we must first calculate the total number of diaper changes required for both children. Given that each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, we can express this as a fraction: 1/2. To find the number of diapers Jordan changes, we can multiply the total number of diaper changes by the fraction representing the proportion changed by Jordan: 10 * (1/2) = 5.

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of red jelly beans in the jar, we must first calculate the volume of the jar. Given that the jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches, we can calculate its volume as follows:

Volume = length × width × height
Volume = 6 × 6 × 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

However, since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans is 80% of the total volume.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 × 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Next, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean, which is 0.15 cubic inches.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans ÷ Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 ÷ 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans × 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 × 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to determine the number of red jelly beans he guessed. Unfortunately, this information is not provided. 

To provide a solution, we will assume that Tim guessed the number of red jelly beans to be 864. 

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, resulting in a total of 20 + 40 = 60 people on the bus.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. This can be calculated as 3/4 * 40 = 30 people. Therefore, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, resulting in a total of 2 * 90 = 180 people on the bus.

To find the number of remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current number of people from the bus's capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

Initially, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 \* $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 \* $6 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This represents a 2.5-fold increase, as 100% of the original cost plus 50% of the original cost equals 150% of the original cost. Therefore, the new cost of one visit is $2 + (1.5 \* $2) = $5. The annual cost is 3 \* $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 \* $15 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is $30 + $45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the time required for all students to participate in the escape room, we must first calculate the total number of groups that can be formed from the students in each grade. Given that there are 10 students in each of the 4 grades, the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since each group consists of 8 students, we can calculate the number of groups by dividing the total number of students by the group size: 40 / 8 = 5.

Now, we need to find the total time required for all groups to participate. Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room, and there are 5 groups. Therefore, the total time required is the product of the number of groups and the time per group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To determine the total amount Ali owes John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, then sum these two values.

The cost of the tables can be calculated as the product of the number of tables and the cost per table: 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.

Similarly, the cost of the roof frames is the product of the number of frames and the cost per frame: 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames: $80 + $20 = $100.

Therefore, Ali owes John a total of $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"Given that Ian has a board that is 40 feet long and he decides to make a cut so he can have two pieces, with the longer piece being 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we can model this situation using a linear equation.

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x. The total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs for his meatballs, we must first calculate the total amount of ground beef required to produce 80 meatballs. Given that he obtains 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can employ a simple ratio to find the necessary quantity of ground beef.

Let's denote the total amount of ground beef needed as x pounds. The ratio of meatballs to pounds of meat is 16:1. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:

16 meatballs / 1 pound = 80 meatballs / x pounds

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

16x = 80

Now, we can divide both sides by 16 to isolate x:

x = 80 / 16
x = 5

Thus, Aiden requires 5 pounds of ground beef to produce 80 meatballs.

Since he adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can calculate the total amount of seasoning needed by multiplying the amount of seasoning per pound by the total pounds of meat:

Total seasoning needed = 2 tablespoons/pound * 5 pounds
Total seasoning needed = 10 tablespoons

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount of fabric Luke should purchase, we must first calculate the total width of the windows. This can be achieved by multiplying the width of a single window by the number of windows.

Let's denote the width of one window as $w$ and the number of windows as $n$. Given that $w = 35$ inches and $n = 5$, we can calculate the total width of the windows as follows:

Total width of windows = $w \times n = 35 \times 5 = 175$ inches

Since Luke requires fabric equal to two times the total width of the windows, we can calculate the required fabric by multiplying the total width by 2:

Fabric needed = $2 \times 175 = 350$ inches

Therefore, Luke should purchase 350 inches of fabric.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To determine the cost of a 36-minute call from a payphone, we need to consider the rate structure, which is a piecewise function. The cost per minute is $0.25 for the first 16 minutes and $0.2 for the remaining minutes.

Let's break down the problem into two parts: the cost for the first 16 minutes and the cost for the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost can be calculated as follows:

$$\text{Cost}_1 = 16 \times 0.25 = 4$$

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost can be calculated as follows:

$$\text{Cost}_2 = 20 \times 0.2 = 4$$

The total cost of the call is the sum of the costs for the two parts:

$$\text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost}_1 + \text{Cost}_2 = 4 + 4 = 8$$

Therefore, the total cost of a 36-minute call from a payphone is $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to calculate the amount of rain on Monday and then find twice that amount, and add 1 inch to it.

Let's denote the amount of rain on Monday as M. Given that M = 2 inches, we can proceed to calculate the amount of rain on Tuesday.

The amount of rain on Tuesday is expected to be 1 more inch than twice the amount of rain on Monday. Mathematically, this can be represented as 2M + 1.

Substituting the value of M, we get 2(2) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

Therefore, the total inches of rain on Tuesday is 5 inches."
"To determine the number of cupcakes Carly made, we can establish a relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as x. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Therefore, the number of brownies can be expressed as 3x - 2.

Given that each person in the class receives two treats and there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

We can now set up an equation to represent the total number of treats: x (cupcakes) + (3x - 2) (brownies) = 10. Simplifying this equation, we get:

x + 3x - 2 = 10

Combine like terms:

4x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To determine the total cost of the services, we first need to calculate the discounted prices of the manicure and pedicure. The original prices are $35 for the manicure and $40 for the pedicure. A 20% discount is applied to both services.

The discount on the manicure is calculated as 0.20 \* 35 = $7. Similarly, the discount on the pedicure is 0.20 \* 40 = $8.

The discounted prices for the manicure and pedicure are $35 - $7 = $28 and $40 - $8 = $32, respectively.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $28 + $32 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 \* $3 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final numerical answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of magazines Susan receives annually, we can break down the information provided. 

Let's denote the number of issues from the first 3 magazines as $I_1$, the number of issues from the second magazine as $I_2$, and the number of issues from the third magazine as $I_3$. We are given that $I_1 = 12$ and $I_2 = 6$. The third magazine sends 4 times the number of issues as the second magazine, so $I_3 = 4 \times I_2 = 4 \times 6 = 24$.

Now, we can calculate the total number of issues Susan receives annually by summing the issues from each magazine: $I_{total} = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 = 12 + 6 + 24 = 42$.

However, this is not the final answer, as the question asks for the total number of magazines Susan receives annually. Since the first 3 magazines send 12 issues each, and the second magazine sends 6 issues, and the third magazine sends 24 issues, we can infer that the first 3 magazines are identical, and the third magazine is a distinct type. Therefore, Susan receives a total of 4 different magazines annually.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of paintings Kim has, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as $K$, the number of paintings Shelley has as $S$, and the number of paintings Samantha has as $A$.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. $A = S - 12$
2. $S = K + 8$
3. $A = 27$

Substituting equation (1) into equation (3), we get:

$S - 12 = 27$

Solving for $S$, we have:

$S = 27 + 12$
$S = 39$

Now, substituting the value of $S$ into equation (2), we get:

$39 = K + 8$

Solving for $K$, we have:

$K = 39 - 8$
$K = 31$

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To determine the price of the toy after the discounts, we can apply the concept of percentage changes in a step-by-step manner.

Let's denote the initial price of the toy as $40. In December, the price increased by 80%, which can be calculated as follows:

Price increase = 80% of $40 = 0.8 \* $40 = $32

The new price in December is the sum of the initial price and the price increase:

New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%, which can be calculated as follows:

Price decrease = 50% of $72 = 0.5 \* $72 = $36

The new price in January is the difference between the price in December and the price decrease:

New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

Therefore, the final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"To determine the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the revenue generated from both the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons.

Let's begin by calculating the revenue from the standard rate lessons. Since Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour, we can calculate this as follows:

Revenue from standard rate lessons = 4 \* $80 = $320

Next, we need to calculate the revenue from the reduced rate lessons. Since Charlie reduces his rate by 25% for veteran clients, the reduced rate is 75% of the standard rate. We can express this as:

Reduced rate = $80 \* 0.75 = $60 per hour

Now, we can calculate the revenue from the reduced rate lessons:

Revenue from reduced rate lessons = 2 \* $60 = $120

To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we add the revenue from both the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons:

Total revenue = Revenue from standard rate lessons + Revenue from reduced rate lessons
= $320 + $120
= $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To calculate the mean score, we employ the formula for the arithmetic mean, which is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. In this case, we have a set of scores: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

First, we calculate the sum of these scores:

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Sum} &= 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \\
&= 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \\
&= 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \\
&= 50 + (80 + 80) + (60 + 40) + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \\
&= 50 + 160 + 100 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \\
&= 50 + 160 + 100 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \\
&= 50 + 160 + 250 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \\
&= 50 + 160 + 250 + 90 + 170 + 60 \\
&= 50 + 160 + 250 + 260 + 60 \\
&= 50 + 160 + 510 + 60 \\
&= 50 + 670 + 60 \\
&= 50 + 730 \\
&= 780
\end{aligned}$$

There are 9 scores in total. Now, we divide the sum by the total number of scores to find the mean:

$$\text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum}}{\text{Number of scores}} = \frac{780}{9}$$

$$\text{Mean} = 86.\overline{6}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{86.67}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of pomelos Eve gave away as x. Since Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up the following equation:

20 - x = (1/4) * 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 - x = 5

To isolate x, we can subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

-x = -15

Multiplying both sides by -1 to solve for x:

x = 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps.

First, we need to find the number of apples Walter ate. This can be calculated as 2/5 of the total number of apples, which is 60.

$$\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24$$

So, Walter ate 24 apples.

Next, we need to find the number of apples remaining. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of apples eaten from the total number of apples.

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we need to find the number of apples Walter gave to his sister. This is 25% of the remaining 36 apples.

$$\frac{25}{100} \times 36 = 0.25 \times 36 = 9$$

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples.

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of apples given to his sister from the remaining apples.

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The amount of money he received can be calculated by multiplying the number of apples sold by the price per apple.

$$27 \times 3 = 81$$

Therefore, Walter received $81.

The final answer is: $81"
"To determine the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we can utilize a proportionality relationship. If 9 novels represent 3 quarters of the total number of novels written this year, we can set up a proportion to solve for the unknown quantity.

Let x be the total number of novels written this year. The proportion can be expressed as:

9 = (3/4)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3 to isolate x.

x = 9 * (4/3)

x = 12

Therefore, Regina wrote 12 novels this year.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we first need to calculate the total distance traveled in 3 days. Given that Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr, we can calculate the total distance traveled as follows:

Let's first calculate the total hours traveled in 3 days:
Total hours = 3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

Next, we need to find the percentage of the distance covered. The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. We can calculate the percentage covered as follows:

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

Therefore, the percentage of the distance covered by Michael is 60%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the initial number of grapes, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of grapes as $x$. 

Madeline consumed 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, which is $6 \cdot 5 = 30$ grapes. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is $6 + 30 = 36$ grapes.

The remaining grapes were used by their mother to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes used by their mother is $4 \cdot 12 = 48$ grapes.

However, we know that the total number of grapes used by all three is the sum of the grapes consumed by Madeline, her brother, and their mother. This can be expressed as:

$$x - 36 - 48 = x - 84$$

Since the mother used all the remaining grapes, the number of grapes left over is 0. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

$$x - 84 = 0$$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$$x = 84$$

Thus, the initial number of grapes is 84.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School on the given day, we can utilize a simple arithmetic operation. The total number of teachers can be calculated by adding the number of teachers who were not absent to the number of substitute teachers.

Let's denote the total number of teachers as T, the number of teachers who were not sick as N, and the number of substitute teachers as S. We are given that T = 82 and the number of teachers who were sick, S, is 13. Therefore, the number of teachers who were not sick, N, is T - S = 82 - 13 = 69.

Now, we can calculate the total number of teachers at school by adding the number of teachers who were not sick to the number of substitute teachers: N + S = 69 + 9 = 78.

Therefore, the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School on the given day is 78.

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the annual expenditure on making macaroni and cheese, we must first calculate the weekly cost of the ingredients. The cost of the pasta is a fixed $1.00 per box. The cheddar cheese costs $3.00, while the gruyere cheese is twice as expensive, at $6.00.

The total weekly cost of the macaroni and cheese is therefore $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a standard year, we can calculate the annual expenditure by multiplying the weekly cost by the number of weeks: $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

Therefore, the annual expenditure on making macaroni and cheese is $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To determine the percentage of time the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, we first need to calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Given that it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time can be calculated as follows:

Total time = Number of classrooms × Time per classroom
Total time = 80 classrooms × 15 minutes/classroom
Total time = 1200 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60:

Total time (hours) = 1200 minutes ÷ 60
Total time (hours) = 20 hours

Next, we need to calculate the total available time for cleaning, which is 5 days × 8 hours/day:

Total available time = 5 days × 8 hours/day
Total available time = 40 hours

Now, we can find the percentage of time spent cleaning classrooms by dividing the total time spent cleaning by the total available time and multiplying by 100:

Percentage of time spent cleaning = (Total time spent cleaning ÷ Total available time) × 100
Percentage of time spent cleaning = (20 hours ÷ 40 hours) × 100
Percentage of time spent cleaning = 0.5 × 100
Percentage of time spent cleaning = 50%

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we must first calculate the capacity of each shelf. Given that the middle shelves can hold 10 books each, the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and the top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, we can establish the following capacities:

Let's denote the capacity of a middle shelf as $m = 10$ books. Then, the capacity of the bottom shelf is $2m = 2 \times 10 = 20$ books, and the capacity of the top shelf is $2m - 5 = 20 - 5 = 15$ books.

The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all shelves: $m + m + 2m + (2m - 5) = 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55$ books.

Now, to find the number of bookcases needed to hold 110 books, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: $\frac{110}{55} = 2$.

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost of the eggs and the total revenue generated from their sale.

The cost of five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen can be calculated as follows:

Total Cost = Number of Dozens × Cost per Dozen
Total Cost = 5 × $2.40
Total Cost = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the total number of eggs purchased is:

Total Eggs = Number of Dozens × Eggs per Dozen
Total Eggs = 5 × 12
Total Eggs = 60

Rose sells the eggs in sets of 3, and each set is sold for $1. To find the total revenue, we need to determine the number of sets of 3 eggs that can be sold:

Number of Sets = Total Eggs ÷ Eggs per Set
Number of Sets = 60 ÷ 3
Number of Sets = 20

The total revenue is then calculated as follows:

Total Revenue = Number of Sets × Price per Set
Total Revenue = 20 × $1
Total Revenue = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

Therefore, Rose's profit is $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the number of white hats, we can break down the problem into manageable steps. 

First, we calculate the number of red hats, which is half of the total number of hats. This can be expressed as:

Red hats = 100 * (1/2) = 50

Next, we find the remaining hats, which is the total number of hats minus the number of red hats:

Remaining hats = 100 - 50 = 50

Now, we calculate the number of blue hats, which is 3/5 of the remaining hats:

Blue hats = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Finally, we determine the number of white hats by subtracting the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:

White hats = 50 - 30 = 20

Therefore, the number of white hats is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the cost of each stick of beef jerky, we must first calculate the discounted price of the bag. Given that the original price of the bag is $18.00 and the discount is $3.00, we can compute the discounted price as follows:

Discounted price = Original price - Discount
= $18.00 - $3.00
= $15.00

Converting the discounted price to cents, we have:

Discounted price (in cents) = $15.00 * 100
= 1500 cents

Now, we can calculate the cost of each stick of jerky by dividing the discounted price in cents by the number of sticks per bag:

Cost per stick = Discounted price (in cents) / Number of sticks per bag
= 1500 cents / 30
= 50 cents

Therefore, the cost of each stick of beef jerky is 50 cents.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we must first calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly to achieve a 70% passing rate.

Let's denote the total number of questions as $T$. Since Audrey needs to get 70% of $T$ correct, we can express this as:

$$0.7T = \text{total correct answers}$$

We know that the total number of questions is the sum of the questions on the first and second tests, which is $70 + 40 = 110$. Therefore, we can substitute $T = 110$ into the equation:

$$0.7(110) = \text{total correct answers}$$

Solving for the total correct answers, we get:

$$77 = \text{total correct answers}$$

Since Audrey got 60% of the 70 questions on the first test correct, we can calculate the number of correct answers on the first test as:

$$0.6(70) = 42$$

To find the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of correct answers on the first test from the total number of correct answers:

$$77 - 42 = 35$$

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B.

We are given that B = 5S - 4, which represents the relationship between the number of blueberry cubes and strawberry cubes. Additionally, we know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

We can rewrite the second equation as B = 116 - S. Now, we can equate the two expressions for B: 5S - 4 = 116 - S.

To solve for S, we can add S to both sides of the equation, resulting in 6S - 4 = 116. Next, we add 4 to both sides, yielding 6S = 120.

Dividing both sides by 6, we obtain S = 20. Now that we have the value of S, we can substitute it into the expression for B: B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

The final answer is: $\boxed{96}$"
"To determine the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Given that she has been playing 40 games every year and her score for every game is 21 points, we can calculate the total points scored by multiplying the number of games played per year by the score per game and then multiplying the result by the number of years.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Total points = (Number of games/year) × (Score per game) × (Number of years)
= 40 games/year × 21 points/game × 4 years

Using the order of operations, we first multiply the number of games per year by the score per game:

40 games/year × 21 points/game = 840 points/year

Then, we multiply the result by the number of years:

840 points/year × 4 years = 3360 points

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360.

The final answer is: 3360"

1. Initially, Brendan had 10 marbles.
2. Upon tripping, he dropped half of them, resulting in a loss of 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. Therefore, he was left with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles.
3. Subsequently, he found 3 additional marbles, bringing the total to 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. However, upon closer inspection, one of the marbles was found to be a bead, necessitating its removal. Consequently, the number of marbles was reduced to 8 - 1 = 7.

Therefore, the number of marbles Brendan ended up with is 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus, we can apply a series of ratios based on historical averages.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The conversion rate from customers to sales is 1:2, meaning that for every 2 customers, 1 sale is made. To achieve 15 sales, we need a total of 15 * 2 = 30 customers.
2. The conversion rate from telephone calls to customers is 1:25, meaning that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer is generated. To achieve 30 customers, we need a total of 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, based on these ratios, Jason would need to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: 750"
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights used by Brianna's family, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's consider the flashlights. Since there are 4 people in the household, and each person has a flashlight, the total number of flashlights is simply 4.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house, and we are given that half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, while the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

To find the number of small candles, we can calculate 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.

To find the number of medium candles, we can calculate 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is the sum of the small and medium candles, which is 16 + 20 = 36.

Now, we can find the total number of candles and flashlights by adding the two quantities together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

The final numerical answer is: 40"
"To determine the number of chips each family member receives, we must first calculate the total number of chips available. Given that Mitchell purchases two bags of chips, each containing 55 chips, the total number of chips is the product of the number of bags and the number of chips per bag.

Let's denote the number of bags as $B$ and the number of chips per bag as $C$. Therefore, the total number of chips, $T$, is given by:

$$T = B \times C$$

Substituting the given values, we have:

$$T = 2 \times 55 = 110$$

Now, to find the number of chips each family member receives, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members, denoted as $N$. In this case, $N = 5$. Therefore, the number of chips per family member, $x$, is given by:

$$x = \frac{T}{N} = \frac{110}{5}$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$x = 22$$

Therefore, each family member receives 22 chips.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total time required to solve the Rubik's cube, we can calculate the time for each side and then sum these values. 

Let's denote the time for the first side as $t_1 = 5$ minutes. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so their times are $t_2 = t_3 = 2t_1 = 2(5) = 10$ minutes. The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so their times are $t_4 = t_5 = \frac{t_1}{2} = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5$ minutes.

The total time $T$ required to solve the Rubik's cube is the sum of the times for all five sides:

$$T = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + t_4 + t_5 = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30$$

Therefore, the total time required to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a relationship between the number of robots, helmets, and footballs. Let's denote the number of footballs as F, the number of helmets as H, and the number of robots as R.

We are given that H = 20. It is also stated that the number of robots is half the number of helmets, so R = H / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10.

Furthermore, we know that the number of helmets is half the number of footballs, which can be expressed as H = F / 2. Substituting the value of H, we get 20 = F / 2, and solving for F yields F = 20 * 2 = 40.

To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to sum the number of robots, helmets, and footballs: R + H + F = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70.

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To determine the number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we need to calculate the total number of calls he handles in a day and then multiply it by the number of working days.

First, let's convert the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the time it takes to deal with a call is 15 minutes = 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we can calculate the number of calls Tim deals with in a day by dividing the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call: 6 hours / 0.25 hours per call = 24 calls per day.

To find the total number of calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by the number of working days: 24 calls per day * 5 days = 120 calls.

Therefore, the total number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week is 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the time difference in drying between the old and new varnishes on 6 paintings, we first calculate the total time required for each type of varnish to dry on the paintings.

The time it takes for the old varnish to dry on one painting is 7 minutes. Therefore, the total time for 6 paintings is 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes.

The time it takes for the new varnish to dry on one painting is 12 minutes. Consequently, the total time for 6 paintings is 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes.

To find the difference in drying time between the old and new varnishes, we subtract the time for the old varnish from the time for the new varnish: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we must first categorize the plants based on their water requirements. There are three distinct categories: plants requiring half a cup of water, plants requiring one cup of water, and plants requiring a quarter of a cup of water.

The first category consists of 4 plants, each requiring 0.5 cups of water. The total water needed for this category is 4 \* 0.5 = 2 cups.

The second category comprises 8 plants, each requiring 1 cup of water. The total water needed for this category is 8 \* 1 = 8 cups.

The remaining plants, which are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 in number, require a quarter of a cup of water each. The total water needed for this category is 8 \* 0.25 = 2 cups.

To find the total amount of water Crista needs, we sum the water required for each category: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

"To determine the time it will take Phineas to return home, we must consider the distances and speeds involved in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Given that Phineas is 200 yards away from his home, we can divide the total distance into two equal segments, each 100 yards in length.

The time it takes to cover a distance is given by the formula $t = \frac{d}{v}$, where $t$ is the time in minutes, $d$ is the distance in yards, and $v$ is the speed in yards per minute.

For the terrestrial segment, the speed is 20 yards per minute, so the time taken to cover 100 yards is $t_{\text{land}} = \frac{100}{20} = 5$ minutes.

For the aquatic segment, the speed is 10 yards per minute, so the time taken to cover 100 yards is $t_{\text{water}} = \frac{100}{10} = 10$ minutes.

The total time taken to return home is the sum of the times for the terrestrial and aquatic segments: $t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{land}} + t_{\text{water}} = 5 + 10 = 15$ minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is 15 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of the popsicle sticks, we must first calculate the number of boxes required. Given that Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 sticks, we can use the following formula:

Number of boxes = Total number of sticks / Number of sticks per box

"Given that there are five phones on a phone plan, with the main phone costing twice as much as each additional phone, and the main phone plan costs $20, we can approach this problem using a straightforward algebraic method.

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, its cost can be expressed as 2x. We are given that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

$$
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{20}{2}
$$

$$
x = 10
$$

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

$$
4x = 4 \cdot 10
$$

$$
4x = 40
$$

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

$$
\text{Total cost} = 20 + 40
$$

$$
\text{Total cost} = 60
$$

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine Derrick's daily revenue, we first need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day. Given that he produces 10 dozen doughnuts daily, and knowing that 1 dozen is equivalent to 12, we can express this as:

10 \* 12 = 120 doughnuts per day

The price of each doughnut is $2. Therefore, the daily revenue can be calculated as:

Daily Revenue = Number of doughnuts sold per day \* Price per doughnut
= 120 \* $2
= $240 per day

Since June has 30 days, we can calculate Derrick's total revenue for the month by multiplying his daily revenue by the number of days in June:

Total Revenue = Daily Revenue \* Number of days in June
= $240 \* 30

"To determine the total cost of dry-cleaning Alicia's clothes for a period of 5 weeks, we must first calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

The weekly cost can be calculated by multiplying the cost per item by the quantity of each item. The cost per blouse is $5.00, the cost per skirt is $6.00, and the cost per pair of pants is $8.00. The quantities of each item are 5 blouses, 1 skirt, and 2 pairs of pants.

Weekly cost = (5 blouses * $5.00) + (1 skirt * $6.00) + (2 pairs of pants * $8.00)
Weekly cost = $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00
Weekly cost = $47.00

To find the total cost for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks.

Total cost = Weekly cost * 5
Total cost = $47.00 * 5
Total cost = $235.00

The final answer is: $235.00"
"To determine the time it takes for John to speak 10 pages at his new speed, we first need to calculate his new speaking rate in words per minute (WPM). Given that his original speaking speed is 150 WPM and he has increased it by a factor of 2.5, we can calculate his new speed as follows:

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Next, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages, assuming each page has 450 words. 

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Total words / New speed to find the time it takes to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM.

Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 hours

Therefore, it would take John 12 hours to speak 10 pages at his new speed.

"To determine the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we can break down the problem into manageable components. Let's start by calculating the number of people Conor saw on the first three days.

On the first day, Conor observed 50 people at the beach. On the second day, the number of people increased by 20, resulting in 50 + 20 = 70 individuals. On the third day, the number of people doubled from the second day, yielding 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is the sum of these values: 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, we can calculate the total number of people he saw on the remaining days by multiplying the average by the number of days: 60 * 4 = 240.

To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people he saw on the first three days to the number he saw on the remaining days: 260 + 240 = 500.

The final answer is: $\boxed{500}$"
"To determine the total number of popcorn pieces Garrett has to eat, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and add them up.

Let's denote the number of kernels that popped in the first 30 seconds as $K_1 = 20$. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to three times the initial amount, so the number of kernels that popped is $K_2 = 3K_1 = 3 \cdot 20 = 60$.

In the subsequent 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, so the number of kernels that popped is $K_3 = 4K_1 = 4 \cdot 20 = 80$.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so the number of kernels that popped is $K_4 = 0.5K_3 = 0.5 \cdot 80 = 40$.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so the number of kernels that popped due to residual heat is $K_5 = 0.25K_4 = 0.25 \cdot 40 = 10$.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: $K_{\text{total}} = K_1 + K_2 + K_3 + K_4 + K_5 = 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{210}$"
"To determine the number of lemons required for the lemonade, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed. Given that each gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of fresh lemon juice, and Tim plans to make 4 gallons for the party plus an additional gallon for Allen, we can calculate the total amount of lemon juice required.

Let's denote the total amount of lemonade as $L$, the number of gallons as $G$, and the number of lemons required to yield 1 cup of juice as $N$. We know that $L = G + 1$ and $G = 5$. Therefore, $L = 5 + 1 = 6$ gallons.

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, the total amount of lemon juice required is $L \times 1 = 6$ cups.

We also know that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. Therefore, the number of lemons required to yield 6 cups of juice can be calculated as follows:

$$\frac{6 \text{ cups}}{1 \text{ cup/6 lemons}} = \frac{6}{1} \times 6 = 6 \times 6 = 36$$

However, this calculation assumes that the extra tart lemonade requires the same amount of juice as the regular lemonade. Since the extra tart lemonade is twice as tart, it requires twice the amount of juice. Therefore, we need to add the number of lemons required for the extra tart lemonade to the number of lemons required for the regular lemonade.

The number of lemons required for the extra tart lemonade is $\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{1 \text{ cup/6 lemons}} = \frac{2}{1} \times 6 = 2 \times 6 = 12$.

Therefore, the total number of lemons required is $36 + 12 = 48$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total amount of dog food required for the kennel, we must first calculate the daily consumption of the German Shepherds and Bulldogs. The daily consumption of a German Shepherd is 5 kg, while that of a Bulldog is 3 kg. 

Given that there are 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs, the total daily consumption can be calculated as follows:

Daily consumption of German Shepherds: 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg/day
Daily consumption of Bulldogs: 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg/day
Total daily consumption: 15 kg/day + 6 kg/day = 21 kg/day

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7:

Weekly consumption = 21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg

Therefore, the kennel will require 147 kg of dog food per week.

The final answer is: 147"
"To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of legs from the 2-legged and 4-legged animals separately and then summing these values.

Let's denote the number of 2-legged animals as $n_{2}$ and the number of 4-legged animals as $n_{4}$. Given that $n_{2} = 10$ and $n_{4} = 15$, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

Total number of legs from 2-legged animals: $2n_{2} = 2 \times 10 = 20$
Total number of legs from 4-legged animals: $4n_{4} = 4 \times 15 = 60$

The total number of legs on the farm is the sum of these two values: $20 + 60 = 80$.

Since we are interested in the number of pairs of legs, we can divide the total number of legs by 2 to obtain the desired result:

Total pairs of legs = $\frac{80}{2} = 40$

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"Given the problem, we can approach it by first identifying the number of blue and yellow blocks. We know that there are 4 blue blocks, and the number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks. Therefore, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is the sum of their individual counts, which is 4 + 8 = 12.

Let's denote the number of red blocks as 'r'. Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, we can set up the equation:

4 (blue blocks) + 8 (yellow blocks) + r (red blocks) = 32

Simplifying the equation, we get:
12 + r = 32

Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation, we get:
r = 32 - 12
r = 20

Therefore, the number of red blocks in the tower is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the distance Elvis is from his house, we must consider the net displacement, which is the difference between the total distance traveled in the positive direction (east) and the total distance traveled in the negative direction (west).

Let's denote the speed as $v = 18$ mph and the time spent traveling west as $t_w = 5$ hours and the time spent traveling east as $t_e = 8$ hours.

The distance traveled west is given by $d_w = v \cdot t_w = 18 \cdot 5 = 90$ miles.

The distance traveled east is given by $d_e = v \cdot t_e = 18 \cdot 8 = 144$ miles.

The net displacement is the difference between the distance traveled east and the distance traveled west: $d_{net} = d_e - d_w = 144 - 90 = 54$ miles.

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the value of the boat after three years, we can apply the concept of depreciation, which is a reduction in the value of an asset over time. In this case, the boat depreciates by a certain percentage each year.

The initial value of the boat is $9000. 

In the first year, the boat depreciates by 30%, which can be calculated as follows:

Depreciation in the first year = 0.3 \* $9000 = $2700
Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

In the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30% of its value after the first year:

Depreciation in the second year = 0.3 \* $6300 = $1890
Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20% of its value after the second year:

Depreciation in the third year = 0.2 \* $4410 = $882
Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

Therefore, the value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To determine the number of pink candies in the bag, we can utilize a systematic approach by first identifying the quantities of the other colored candies. 

Given that the bag contains 232 pieces of individually wrapped candies, we are informed that there are 54 red candies. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, which can be expressed as 2 * 54 = 108. 

Furthermore, the number of yellow candies is stated to be half the number of red candies, which can be calculated as 54 / 2 = 27.

To find the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies, we can sum these quantities: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Now, to determine the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies in the bag: 232 - 189 = 43.

Therefore, the number of pink candies in the bag is 43.

The final answer is: 43"
"To determine the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the bus trips separately and then sum them.

The cost of the hotel can be calculated by multiplying the cost of one night by the number of nights. Let's denote the cost of one night at the hotel as $80. The number of nights is given as 3. Therefore, the total cost of the hotel is:

$$\text{Total cost of hotel} = 80 \times 3 = 240$$

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel. This can be expressed as:

$$\text{Cost of one bus trip} = 0.1 \times 80 = 8$$

Given that Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is:

$$\text{Total cost of bus trips} = 8 \times 7 = 56$$

To find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels, we sum the total cost of the hotel and the total cost of the bus trips:

$$\text{Total cost} = 240 + 56 = 296$$

The final answer is: $296"
"Given that Mazie has 52 marbles and distributes them equally between twins Dallas and Darla, we can infer that the marbles are divided in a manner that respects the principle of partitioning a set. 

Let's denote the number of marbles given to Darla as x. Since the twins are identical in every aspect, including their marble distribution, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + (x + 4) = 52

Here, x represents the number of marbles given to Darla, and (x + 4) represents the number of marbles given to Dallas, considering that he dropped 4 marbles.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 4 = 52

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 48

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 24

Therefore, Mazie gave 24 marbles to Darla.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the total cost of the family's cinema outing, we must first calculate the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately and then sum them together.

The cost of the adult tickets is 2 * $12 = $24, as there are two adults in the family. The cost of the child ticket is $8. 

The cost of the popcorns is 2 * $3 = $6, as they purchased two popcorns for $3 each.

Now, let's add the costs together: $24 + $8 + $6 = $38.

Therefore, the total cost of the family's cinema outing is $38.

The final answer is: $38"
"To determine the force required to move the car, we need to calculate the total weight of the vehicle, its contents, and occupants. The weight of the car is given as 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and the two children weigh 75 pounds each.

First, we calculate the total weight of the children:
Weight of children = 2 * 75 pounds
Weight of children = 150 pounds

Next, we calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children:
Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:
Force = 1% * total weight
Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

Therefore, the force required to move the car is 16 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs to buy, we must calculate the perimeter of the rectangular backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

P = 2l + 2w

where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Given that the length (l) of the backyard fence is 20 feet and the width (w) is 15 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(20) + 2(15)
P = 40 + 30
P = 70

Therefore, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"Given that Mia and Emma are 16 years apart in age, with Mia being the younger individual at 40 years old, we can determine Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age. Therefore, Emma's age is 40 + 16 = 56 years old.

To calculate the average age of Mia and Emma, we take the sum of their ages and divide by 2. The average age is (40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48.

The average age of Mia and Emma is 48 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total number of good seashells, we must first calculate the total number of seashells collected by Tom, Nancy, and Benny, and then subtract the number of cracked seashells from this total.

Let's denote the total number of seashells collected as S, the number of seashells collected by Tom as T, the number of seashells collected by Nancy as N, and the number of seashells collected by Benny as B. We are given that T = 214, N = 432, and B = 86.

The total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each individual:

S = T + N + B
S = 214 + 432 + 86
S = 732

Next, we need to subtract the number of cracked seashells, denoted as C, from the total number of seashells collected. We are given that C = 67.

The number of good seashells, denoted as G, is the difference between the total number of seashells collected and the number of cracked seashells:

G = S - C
G = 732 - 67
G = 665

Therefore, the total number of good seashells collected by Tom, Nancy, and Benny is 665.

The final answer is: 665"
"To determine the total cost of the place settings for Avery's holiday dinner, we must first calculate the cost of each type of plate and then sum these costs.

Let's denote the cost of dinner plates as $6.00 each, bowls as $5.00 each, and salad plates as $4.00 each. Given that Avery needs 12 place settings, we can calculate the total cost of each type of plate as follows:

- The cost of dinner plates is 6 * 12 = $72.
- The cost of bowls is 5 * 12 = $60.
- The cost of salad plates is 4 * 12 = $48.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the place settings by summing the costs of the dinner plates, bowls, and salad plates: $72 + $60 + $48 = $180.

Therefore, the total cost of the place settings for Avery's holiday dinner is $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To determine the time it took Anna to complete the puzzle, we can start by calculating half of Steve's time, which is a straightforward arithmetic operation.

Let's denote Steve's time as S = 10 hours. Half of Steve's time can be calculated as:

S/2 = 10/2 = 5 hours

Now, we are given that Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time to complete the puzzle. Therefore, we can express Anna's time as:

A = S/2 + 2
A = 5 + 2
A = 7 hours

Thus, it took Anna 7 hours to complete the puzzle.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the amount of feed left after a week, we must first calculate the daily feed consumption of the pigs and then extrapolate this value to a weekly basis.

Given that each pig consumes 4 pounds of feed twice a day, the daily feed consumption per pig can be expressed as:

4 pounds/day (feed per pig) × 2 (feedings per day) = 8 pounds/day (feed per pig)

With 5 pigs, the total daily feed consumption is:

8 pounds/day (feed per pig) × 5 (number of pigs) = 40 pounds/day

To find the weekly feed consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:

40 pounds/day × 7 days/week = 280 pounds/week

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. Therefore, the amount of feed left after a week can be calculated as:

300 pounds (initial feed) - 280 pounds (feed consumed) = 20 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount John needs to spend on hot dogs, we must first calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. Given that each guest will consume 2 hot dogs, and there are 20 guests, the total number of hot dogs required can be calculated as follows:

Total hot dogs required = Number of guests × Number of hot dogs per guest
= 20 × 2
= 40

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Therefore, we subtract these from the total required to obtain the actual number of hot dogs John needs to purchase:

Actual hot dogs required = Total hot dogs required - Hot dogs already available
= 40 - 4
= 36

Since each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we can determine the number of packs John needs to buy by dividing the actual hot dogs required by the number of hot dogs per pack:

Number of packs required = Actual hot dogs required ÷ Number of hot dogs per pack
= 36 ÷ 6
= 6

To find the total amount John needs to spend on hot dogs, we multiply the number of packs required by the cost per pack:

Total amount required = Number of packs required × Cost per pack
= 6 × $2
= $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine Frances' remaining funds, we must first calculate her total revenue and then subtract her expenses.

Let's begin by calculating her revenue from the sale of cupcakes and cookies. The revenue from cupcakes can be calculated as the product of the number of cupcakes sold and the price per cupcake: 20 cupcakes * $2 = $40. Similarly, the revenue from cookies is the product of the number of cookies sold and the price per cookie: 40 cookies * $1 = $40. Therefore, her total revenue is the sum of these two amounts: $40 + $40 = $80.

Next, we need to calculate her expenses. Frances purchased five trays at $4 each, so her total expenses are 5 trays * $4 = $20.

Now, we can determine her remaining funds by subtracting her expenses from her total revenue: $80 - $20 = $60.

Therefore, Frances has $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the number of children following the ice cream truck, we can model this scenario using a recursive sequence. Let's denote the number of children at the end of each street as follows:

- At the end of the first street, there are 5 children (n1 = 5).
- At the end of the second street, each of the n1 children is joined by another child, resulting in a total of n2 = n1 + n1 = 2n1 = 2(5) = 10 children.
- At the end of the third street, each of the n2 children is joined by another 2 children, resulting in a total of n3 = n2 + 2n2 = 3n2 = 3(10) = 30 children.

However, the original 5 children then leave the group, so we need to subtract them from the total number of children at the end of the third street. This can be represented as n3 - n1 = 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, the number of children following the ice cream truck is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. The total number of meals given out can be calculated by summing the meals distributed on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

Total meals given out = 64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday)
Total meals given out = 142

Now, we can subtract the total meals given out from the initial number of meals Mamou had to find the remaining meals.

Meals left to distribute = Total meals Mamou has - Total meals given out
Meals left to distribute = 1,360 - 142
Meals left to distribute = 1,218

Therefore, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute to the affected families."
"To determine the total amount of money James has, we need to calculate the value of each coin and sum them together. 

A quarter is worth $0.25, which is equivalent to 25 cents. Two nickels are worth $0.10, or 10 cents. Seven dimes are worth $0.70, or 70 cents.

Now, let's add the values together:
\[ 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 \]

Therefore, James has a total of $1.05, or 105 cents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{105}$"
"To determine the total age of the siblings, we can approach this problem by first identifying the age of the older brother. Given that one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Let x be the age of the older brother. Then, 12 = x/2.

Solving for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate x:

x = 12 * 2
x = 24

Therefore, the older brother is 24 years old.

Next, we calculate the total age of the 3 sisters, who are all 16 years old:

Total age of sisters = 3 * 16
Total age of sisters = 48

Now, we can find the total age of the 2 brothers by adding their ages:

Total age of brothers = 12 + 24
Total age of brothers = 36

Finally, we can determine the total age of all the siblings by adding the total age of the brothers and the total age of the sisters:

Total age of all siblings = Total age of brothers + Total age of sisters
Total age of all siblings = 36 + 48
Total age of all siblings = 84

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation. Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, resulting in a daily meditation time of 30 minutes. Since she meditates 7 days a week, the total meditation time per week is given by the formula:

Meditation time per week = 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week

Next, we calculate the time spent on yoga. Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week. Therefore, the total yoga time per week is:

Yoga time per week = 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week

Now, we can find the total time spent on meditation and yoga per week by adding the meditation and yoga times:

Total time per week = Meditation time per week + Yoga time per week
= 210 minutes/week + 300 minutes/week
= 510 minutes/week

To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks, we multiply the total time per week by 4:

Total time in 4 weeks = Total time per week * 4
= 510 minutes/week * 4
= 2040 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2040}$"
"To determine the total square feet of fabric used for the quilt, we need to calculate the total area covered by each type of t-shirt and sum them up.

The area of a small t-shirt is 3 square feet, a medium t-shirt is 4 square feet, and a large t-shirt is 6 square feet. Given that Octavia uses 11 small shirts, 8 medium shirts, and 6 large shirts, we can calculate the total area as follows:

Small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
Medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
Large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Now, we add the total area from each type of shirt:
Total area = 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet

Therefore, the total area of the quilt is 101 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{101}$"
"To determine the total number of sunflower seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower. Given that a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, we can express this as $3 \times 12 = 36$ seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we can multiply 36 by 0.5, which yields $36 \times 0.5 = 18$. Adding this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower, we obtain $36 + 18 = 54$ seeds in a large sunflower.

Now, we can calculate the total number of seeds by summing the seeds in a small and a large sunflower: $36 + 54 = 90$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"Given that George possesses 18 pens, we can establish a proportional relationship between the number of pens owned by each individual. Let's denote the number of pens George owns as G, the number of pens Timothy owns as T, and the number of pens Sarah owns as S.

We are given that Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, which can be expressed as T = 3G. Substituting the given value of G = 18 into this equation yields T = 3(18) = 54.

Furthermore, we are informed that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, which can be represented as S = (1/2)T. Substituting the value of T = 54 into this equation gives S = (1/2)(54) = 27.

Therefore, Sarah owns 27 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a series of relationships between the heights of Jackie, Anne, and Albert. Let's denote Jackie's height before summer as $J_b$, her current height as $J_c$, Anne's height as $A$, and Albert's height as $A_b$.

We are given that Albert's height is 36 inches, so $A_b = 36$. We also know that Anne's height is twice that of Albert's, which implies $A = 2A_b = 2(36) = 72$ inches.

Furthermore, we are told that Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so $J_c = A - 2 = 72 - 2 = 70$ inches. Additionally, we know that Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, which means her current height is 3 inches more than her height before summer, or $J_c = J_b + 3$. 

Therefore, we can solve for Jackie's height before summer by rearranging the equation: $J_b = J_c - 3 = 70 - 3 = 67$ inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{67}$"
"To determine the total revenue generated by the company from selling the produced chocolate bars over a two-week period, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced and then multiply it by the price per bar.

First, we calculate the total number of bars produced in one week. Given that the company produces 5000 bars per day, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bars produced in one week is:

5000 bars/day × 7 days/week = 35000 bars/week

Since we are interested in the revenue over a two-week period, we multiply the weekly production by 2:

35000 bars/week × 2 weeks = 70000 bars

Now, we can calculate the total revenue by multiplying the total number of bars produced by the price per bar, which is $2:

Total Revenue = 70000 bars × $2/bar = $140000

Therefore, the company will receive $140000 for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks.

The final answer is: $140000"
"To determine the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's consider the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake takes advantage of the buy one get one 50% off deal, he pays for one T-shirt at the original price and the other at 50% off. The cost of the first T-shirt is $8, and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 \* 0.5 = $4. Therefore, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's consider the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 \* 0.4 = $16. The discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we can find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store by adding the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the number of movie tickets Ryan can purchase, we must first calculate his total earnings from completing his chores and then subtract the expenses incurred for the ice cream cones.

Ryan's weekly allowance is $6, and he completed his chores for 3 weeks. Therefore, his total earnings can be calculated as follows:

Total earnings = Weekly allowance × Number of weeks
= $6 × 3
= $18

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. Since Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, the total number of cones purchased is 4. The cost of each cone is $1.25, so the total cost of the ice cream cones is:

Total cost of ice cream cones = Number of cones × Cost per cone
= 4 × $1.25
= $5

Now, we can calculate the remaining amount of money Ryan has after purchasing the ice cream cones:

Remaining money = Total earnings - Total cost of ice cream cones
= $18 - $5
= $13

Finally, we can determine the number of movie tickets Ryan can purchase by dividing the remaining money by the cost of a single ticket:

Number of tickets = Remaining money ÷ Cost per ticket
= $13 ÷ $6.50
= 2

Therefore, Ryan can purchase 2 movie tickets.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani, we can apply basic principles of arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total amount spent by Ellen, which consists of two distinct items: a pair of leggings and a photo frame. The cost of the leggings is $100, and the cost of the photo frame is $5. Therefore, the total amount spent by Ellen is the sum of these two costs, which can be expressed as:

Total spent by Ellen = Cost of leggings + Cost of photo frame
= $100 + $5
= $105

Next, we calculate the total amount spent by Lani, which consists of three distinct items: a pair of sunglasses and two bathrobes. The cost of the sunglasses is $30, and the cost of each bathrobe is $100. Since there are two bathrobes, the total cost of the bathrobes is $100 x 2 = $200. Therefore, the total amount spent by Lani is the sum of the cost of the sunglasses and the cost of the bathrobes:

Total spent by Lani = Cost of sunglasses + Cost of bathrobes
= $30 + $200
= $230

To find the total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani, we add the total amount spent by Ellen and the total amount spent by Lani:

Total amount spent = Total spent by Ellen + Total spent by Lani
= $105 + $230
= $335

The final answer is: $335"
"To determine the profit made by Tim from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the total cost of production and the total revenue generated from sales.

The cost of production for one jar is calculated as follows:

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20
Total cost of production for one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

The selling price of one jar is $50. 

The profit from one jar is: $50 - $44 = $6

To find the profit from 10 jars, we multiply the profit from one jar by 10:

Profit from 10 jars = $6 * 10 = $60

Therefore, the profit made by Tim from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix is $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the total dollar amount in the jar, we can calculate the value of each type of coin and sum them together. 

First, let's calculate the value of each type of coin:

- The value of 32 quarters is 32 \* $0.25 = $8.00.
- The value of 95 dimes is 95 \* $0.10 = $9.50.
- The value of 120 nickels is 120 \* $0.05 = $6.00.
- The value of 750 pennies is 750 \* $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add the values together:
$8.00 + $9.50 = $17.50
$17.50 + $6.00 = $23.50
$23.50 + $7.50 = $31.00

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the jar is $31.00.

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine the amount of money Janet has left, we can apply basic arithmetic operations to calculate the total expenditure and then subtract it from the initial amount provided by her parents.

Let's denote the initial amount given by Janet's parents as P = $40. The total expenditure can be calculated as the sum of the costs of ice cream, movie tickets, and the bracelet.

The cost of ice cream is $3.50, the cost of two movie tickets is 2 × $7.50 = $15, and the cost of the bracelet is $8.50. Therefore, the total expenditure E can be expressed as:

E = $3.50 + $15 + $8.50
E = $27

Now, to find the amount of money Janet has left, we subtract the total expenditure from the initial amount given by her parents:

M = P - E
M = $40 - $27
M = $13

Therefore, Janet has $13 left.

The final answer is: $13"
"To determine Josh's weekly earnings, we must first calculate the number of days he operates his car shop. Given that he is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, his operational days are Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. This equates to 5 days per week.

The number of cars serviced per day is 3, and the daily earnings per car is $4. Therefore, the daily earnings can be calculated as follows:

Daily earnings = Number of cars serviced per day × Earnings per car
= 3 cars/day × $4/car
= $12/day

To find the weekly earnings, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of operational days:

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings × Number of operational days
= $12/day × 5 days/week
= $60/week

Since we are interested in Josh's earnings over a 2-week period, we can simply multiply the weekly earnings by 2:

Earnings over 2 weeks = Weekly earnings × 2
= $60/week × 2
= $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the current number of cookies Randy has, we need to apply a systematic approach to account for the changes in his cookie inventory. 

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. This gives us a total of 18 cookies.

We can represent this as a set: C = {9, 4, 5}, where C denotes the set of cookies.

Randy then consumes 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This can be represented as a set difference: C - {1, 1, 1} = {8, 3, 4}, where the set difference operation is used to remove the consumed cookies from the initial set.

Next, Randy eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. This can be represented as another set difference: {8, 3, 4} - {2, 0, 0} = {6, 3, 4}, where the set difference operation is used to remove the consumed oatmeal cookies.

Randy then gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. This can be represented as another set difference: {6, 3, 2} - {0, 0, 2} = {6, 3, 0}, where the set difference operation is used to remove the given sugar cookies.

Finally, Randy bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. This can be represented as a set union: {6, 3, 0} ∪ {4, 4, 4} = {10, 7, 4}, where the set union operation is used to add the baked cookies to the current set.

Therefore, the current number of cookies Randy has is 10 + 7 + 4 = 21.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the total amount Matthew would earn from selling his collection of 12 unique toy soldiers, we can employ a straightforward approach by dividing the collection into two equal halves and calculating the revenue from each half separately.

Let's denote the number of toy soldiers in each half as $n$. Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can express this as $n = 12/2 = 6$. 

For the first half, Matthew would receive $5 per toy, so the revenue from this half would be $5n = 5(6) = 30$ dollars.

For the second half, he would receive $7 per toy, so the revenue from this half would be $7n = 7(6) = 42$ dollars.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we can add the revenues from both halves: $30 + 42 = 72$ dollars.

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to model the situation. Let's denote the number of days Nate spends filling holes as $x$. During this time, the dog digs 6 holes per day, and Nate fills 9 holes per day. However, since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net number of holes filled per day is $9 - 6 = 3$.

The total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's vacation is $6 \cdot 14 = 84$. Since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the total number of holes at the end of the vacation is $84 + 6 \cdot 14 = 168$.

We can set up the equation to represent the situation: $3x = 168$, where $x$ is the number of days Nate spends filling holes.

Solving for $x$, we get:

$$3x = 168$$

$$x = \frac{168}{3}$$

$$x = 56$$

Since we need to find the number of weeks, we'll divide the total days by 7:

$$\text{Weeks} = \frac{56}{7}$$

$$\text{Weeks} = 8$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we can utilize a straightforward arithmetic approach. Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can express this relationship as a ratio.

Let N represent the average enrollment at Norman High School. Then, the average enrollment at Butler High School can be represented as (3/4)N.

We are given that the average enrollment at Norman High School is 4000 students. Therefore, we can substitute this value into the expression for the average enrollment at Butler High School:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000 = 3000 students

To find the difference in enrollment between the two schools, we can subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School:

Difference in enrollment = N - (3/4)N = (1/4)N

Substituting the value of N, we get:

Difference in enrollment = (1/4) * 4000 = 1000

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate chip cookies made by the Adams family, we can utilize a simple arithmetic operation. Given that they have produced a total of 7995 cookies, consisting of 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies, we can calculate the number of chocolate chip cookies by subtracting the sum of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total.

Let's denote the number of chocolate chip cookies as $C$. We can express this relationship as:

$C = 7995 - (2595 + 3075)$

To solve for $C$, we first evaluate the expression within the parentheses:

$C = 7995 - 5670$

Now, we perform the subtraction:

$C = 2325$

Therefore, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2325}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes as $t$, $b$, and $p$, respectively.

We are given the following information:

1. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: $t = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 16 = 8$.
2. Igor gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested: $t = p + 2$, but we know $t = 8$, so $p = 6$.
3. Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers: $b = 7$.
4. The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29: $t + b + p = 29$.

Substituting the known values, we get $8 + 7 + 6 = 21$. However, we know that the total number of items is 29, so we need to find the difference.

Let's denote the number of beakers lost as $L$. Then, the total number of items Igor had is $t + b + p + L = 29$. Since we know $t = 8$, $b = 7$, and $p = 6$, we can write:

$$8 + 7 + 6 + L = 29$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$L = 29 - 21$$

$$L = 8$$

Therefore, Igor lost 8 beakers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over after assembling the tables, we must first calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg necessitates 2 screws, resulting in a total of 8 screws per table. Since James is assembling 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 screws/table * 4 tables = 32 screws.

Given that James possesses 40 screws, we can calculate the number of screws he will have left over by subtracting the total number of screws required from the total number of screws he has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over after assembling the tables.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the total number of eggs in both baskets, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. Let's denote the number of eggs in the first basket as x. Given that the second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first basket, the number of eggs in the second basket is 2x.

We are given that the first basket contains 10 eggs. Therefore, we can equate x to 10, which implies that the second basket contains 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we can add the number of eggs in the first basket (10) to the number of eggs in the second basket (20). This can be expressed as:

x + 2x = 10 + 20

Simplifying the expression, we get:

3x = 30

Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we obtain:

x = 10

However, we are not solving for x; we are interested in the total number of eggs in both baskets. Therefore, we can directly add the number of eggs in the first basket (10) to the number of eggs in the second basket (20):

10 + 20 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total amount of money raised by the girls, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the amount raised by Alexandra as A, Kim as K, Maryam as M, and Sarah as S.

We are given that Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so we can express this as K = A + 320.

We are also given that Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so we can express this as M = S + 400.

Additionally, we know that Alexandra raises $430 and Sarah raises $300.

Substituting the known values, we get A = 430 and S = 300.

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation for K: K = A + 320 = 430 + 320 = 750.

Similarly, we can substitute the value of S into the equation for M: M = S + 400 = 300 + 400 = 700.

To find the total amount raised, we add the amounts raised by each girl: K + A + M + S = 750 + 430 + 700 + 300 = 2180.

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by the girls is $2180."
"Given the scenario, we can establish a relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's running speeds and distances. Let's denote Aaron's speed as A and Vanessa's speed as V. We are given that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so we can express this as:

A = 2V

We are also given that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, which implies that the distance Vanessa runs is twice the distance Aaron runs. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can express this as:

Distance_Vanessa = 2 * Distance_Aaron

Since Distance_Vanessa = 4 miles, we can write:

4 = 2 * Distance_Aaron

Solving for Distance_Aaron, we get:

Distance_Aaron = 4 / 2
Distance_Aaron = 2 miles

Now, we know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Given that Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's speed, we can express his speed as:

A = 2V

We can also express Aaron's speed as:

A = Distance_Aaron / Time_Aaron
A = 2 / 16
A = 1/8 miles per minute

Since A = 2V, we can substitute the expression for A:

2V = 1/8

Solving for V, we get:

V = (1/8) / 2
V = 1/16 miles per minute

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find the time it took her to complete her part of the race:

Time_Vanessa = Distance_Vanessa / V
Time_Vanessa = 4 / (1/16)
Time_Vanessa = 4 * 16
Time_Vanessa = 64 minutes

The final answer is: 64"
"To determine the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock, we can apply the concept of linear proportionality. The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, which can be represented as a ratio of 3:1. 

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

Total line required = (3 feet/foot) * (200 feet)

Using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can rewrite this as:

Total line required = 3 * 200

To calculate the total line required, we multiply 3 by 200:

Total line required = 3 * 200 = 600 feet

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. To find the amount he needs to buy, we subtract this from the total line required:

Line needed to buy = Total line required - Line already available
= 600 feet - 6 feet
= 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To determine the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant, we must first calculate their daily revenue. Given that they receive 6 reservations per night and each reservation consists of 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine, we can calculate the daily revenue as follows:

Daily revenue = (2 meals * $5) + $5 (bottle of wine) = (2 * $5) + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15

However, since they receive 6 reservations per night, we must multiply the daily revenue by 6 to account for the total revenue per night:

Revenue per night = $15 * 6 = $90

Since they are open 2 days a week, we can calculate the weekly revenue by multiplying the revenue per night by the number of days they are open:

Weekly revenue = Revenue per night * Number of days open = $90 * 2 = $180

The final answer is: $180"
"To determine the selling price of each watermelon, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the concept of percentage increase.

Given that the fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80 and sold them at a 25% profit, we can calculate the selling price of each watermelon as follows:

Let's denote the cost price of one watermelon as CP and the selling price as SP. The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80, so we can express this as:

50 * CP = $80

To find the cost price of one watermelon, we divide both sides of the equation by 50:

CP = $80 / 50
CP = $1.60

Now, we can calculate the selling price of one watermelon by applying the 25% profit to the cost price:

SP = CP + (0.25 * CP)
SP = $1.60 + (0.25 * $1.60)
SP = $1.60 + $0.40
SP = $2

Therefore, the selling price of each watermelon is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Given the information provided, we can establish the following relationships:

Let $J$ denote John's current age, $J_{son}$ denote James' current age, and $D$ denote Dora's current age. We are given that:

1. John had James when he was 19, so $J - J_{son} = 19$.
2. James is twice as old as Dora, so $J_{son} = 2D$.
3. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so $D + 3 = 12$, which implies $D = 9$.
4. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so $J - (J_{youngest} + 3) = 32$, where $J_{youngest}$ denotes the current age of John's youngest son.

From (3), we know $D = 9$, and from (2), we have $J_{son} = 2D = 18$. Substituting this into (1), we get $J - 18 = 19$, which implies $J = 37$.

Now, we can use (4) to find the current age of John's youngest son: $J - (J_{youngest} + 3) = 32 \Rightarrow J_{youngest} = J - 35 = 37 - 35 = 2$.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be $2 + 3 = 5$ years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after an hour, we can calculate their respective rates of peeling and then find the difference.

Let's denote the number of oranges Ana peels in an hour as $A$ and the number of oranges Jane peels in an hour as $J$. Given that Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange, her peeling rate is $\frac{1}{3}$ oranges per minute. Similarly, Jane's peeling rate is $\frac{1}{4}$ oranges per minute.

The number of oranges Ana peels in an hour is the product of her peeling rate and the number of minutes in an hour: $A = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 60 = 20$ oranges.

Similarly, the number of oranges Jane peels in an hour is $J = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 60 = 15$ oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is $A - J = 20 - 15 = 5$ oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total cost incurred by Mark, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the labor cost of the mechanic.

First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400. A discount of 80% off the original price can be calculated as follows:

Discount = 80% of $400 = 0.8 \* 400 = $320

The cost of the radiator after the discount is the original cost minus the discount:

Cost of radiator after discount = $400 - $320 = $80

Next, we need to calculate the labor cost of the mechanic. The mechanic works for 3 hours at a rate of $50 per hour. The labor cost can be calculated as follows:

Labor cost = 3 hours \* $50 per hour = 3 \* 50 = $150

The total cost incurred by Mark is the sum of the cost of the radiator after the discount and the labor cost:

Total cost = Cost of radiator after discount + Labor cost
= $80 + $150
= $230

Therefore, Mark paid a total of $230 for the new radiator and the labor cost.

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We are given two equations:

1. C + W = 20 (Equation 1)
2. 2C + 4W = 70 (Equation 2)

We can solve Equation 1 for W: W = 20 - C.

Substituting this expression for W into Equation 2, we get:

2C + 4(20 - C) = 70

Expanding the equation, we get:

2C + 80 - 4C = 70

Combine like terms:

-2C + 80 = 70

Subtract 80 from both sides:

-2C = -10

Divide both sides by -2:

C = 5

Therefore, the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we need to perform a simple division operation. Given that there are 7 pizzas, each cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

Total number of slices = Number of pizzas × Number of slices per pizza
= 7 × 8
= 56

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find out how many slices each person can have. There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends). 

Number of slices per person = Total number of slices ÷ Number of people
= 56 ÷ 4
= 14

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
