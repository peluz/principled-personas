"To determine Janet's daily earnings from selling eggs at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she has left after consuming some for breakfast and baking muffins.

Let's denote the number of eggs laid by Janet as E = 16. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for muffins, so the total number of eggs used is U = 3 + 4 = 7.

The number of eggs left can be calculated as E - U = 16 - 7 = 9.

Janet sells the remaining eggs at $2 per egg. Therefore, her daily earnings can be calculated as 9 \* 2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to consider the amount of blue and white fiber needed. The problem states that 2 bolts of blue fiber are required, and the amount of white fiber is half that amount.

Let's denote the amount of blue fiber as B = 2 bolts. Since the amount of white fiber is half the amount of blue fiber, we can express it as W = B/2.

W = 2/2
W = 1 bolt

Now, we can calculate the total number of bolts required by adding the blue and white fiber together:

Total bolts = B + W
Total bolts = 2 + 1
Total bolts = 3

Therefore, the total number of bolts required for the robe is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

Let's denote the original value of the house as $80,000. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This can be expressed as a percentage increase of 150% of the original value.

To find the new value, we can use the formula for percentage increase:

New value = Original value + (Original value * Percentage increase)
New value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

Now, we need to find the total cost of the house, which is the original price plus the repairs:
Total cost = Original value + Repairs
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

The profit is the difference between the new value and the total cost:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To determine the total distance James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Let's denote the number of sprints James runs in a session as 's' and the distance of each sprint as 'd'. We are given that s = 3 and d = 60 meters. Therefore, the total distance James runs in one session is:

s \* d = 3 \* 60 = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:

Total distance = (s \* d) \* number of sessions/week = 180 meters/session \* 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we must first calculate the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon. 

Let's denote the number of cups of feed given in the morning as M and the number of cups of feed given in the afternoon as A. We are given that M = 15 and A = 25. 

The total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon is M + A = 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: 
60 - 40 = 20 cups

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total cost of the glasses, we can use a geometric series formula. The cost of the first glass is $5, and the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous one. This forms a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 0.6.

The formula for the sum of a geometric series is:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = $5, r = 0.6, and n = 16.

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = $5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6)

S = $5 * (1 - 0.00006103515625) / 0.4

S = $5 * 0.99993896484375 / 0.4

S = $5 * 2.49964246171875

S = $12.49761230859375

However, this is not the total cost. We need to add the cost of the first glass, which is $5. 

The total cost is $12.49761230859375 + $5 = $17.49761230859375.

Rounding to two decimal places, the total cost is approximately $17.50.

The final answer is: $17.50"
"Given the problem, we can establish a relationship between the number of sheep in each city. Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as S, Charleston as C, and Toulouse as T.

We are given that:
1. T = 2C (Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston)
2. C = 4S (Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle)
3. S = 20 (Seattle has 20 sheep)

Substituting the value of S into the equation C = 4S, we get:
C = 4(20) = 80

Now, substituting the value of C into the equation T = 2C, we get:
T = 2(80) = 160

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
T + C + S = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To determine the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break down the process into manageable parts. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. We can express this as a fraction of the total file size: 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB. The download rate is 2 GB/minute, so the time to download 80 GB is 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Next, we need to account for the time it takes to install the updates. This is given as 20 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. We can express this as a fraction of the total file size: 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB. The download rate is 2 GB/minute, so the time to download 120 GB is 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in each segment of his trip and then subtract the total distance from the initial distance.

Let's break down the problem into segments:

1. Distance traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:
\[ d_1 = 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ miles} \]

2. Distance traveled in the first 2 hours of the return trip in standstill traffic:
Since he is not moving, the distance is 0 miles.

3. Distance traveled in the next half-hour at 30 mph:
\[ d_3 = 30 \times 0.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

4. Distance traveled in the remaining 2 hours of the return trip at 80 mph:
\[ d_4 = 80 \times 2 = 160 \text{ miles} \]

Total distance traveled in the return trip = 15 + 160 = 175 miles

Initial distance from home = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the return trip = 175 miles

Total distance traveled = 180 + 175 = 355 miles

Since John is now back home, the distance he is from home is 0 miles.

However, if we are looking for the distance from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to consider the distance he has traveled in the 4 hours. 

Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the return trip = 175 miles

Total distance traveled in 4 hours = 180 + 175 = 355 miles

The distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours is 0 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider her regular hourly rate and overtime pay rate. Her regular hourly rate is $10, and her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are given by the product of her regular hourly rate and the number of hours worked: 40 * $10 = $400.

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her earnings for the overtime hours are given by the product of her overtime pay rate and the number of overtime hours: 5 * $12 = $60.

Her total earnings for the week are the sum of her earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours: $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

Let's start with the first month, where the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 \* 60 = 180 downloads.

Now, let's calculate the downloads for the third month. The number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which gives us 0.3 \* 180 = 54. Subtracting this from 180, we get 180 - 54 = 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To calculate the total cost of the pastries, we need to apply the concept of multiplication to find the cost of each type of pastry and then sum the results.

First, we calculate the cost of 3 dozen donuts: 3 × $68 = $204.

Next, we calculate the cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes: 2 × $80 = $160.

Then, we calculate the cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes: 6 × $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost of the pastries is $694."
"To determine the number of years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the break-even point, which is the point at which the total revenue equals the total cost.

Let's denote the number of years as 'n'. The total cost of the tree is $90, and the annual cost to maintain the tree is $3. The revenue generated each year is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year.

The total cost over 'n' years is $90 + $3n, and the total revenue over 'n' years is $10.5n.

To find the break-even point, we set the total cost equal to the total revenue and solve for 'n':

$90 + $3n = $10.5n

Subtracting $3n from both sides gives us:

$90 = $7.5n

Dividing both sides by $7.5 gives us:

n = $90 / $7.5
n = 12

Therefore, it will take 12 years for the tree to pay for itself, but it will start generating revenue in the first year.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as x.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which can be represented as (1/3)x. This leaves her with (2/3)x vacuum cleaners.

She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, resulting in (2/3)x - 2 vacuum cleaners remaining.

Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of (2/3)x - 2 is (1/2)((2/3)x - 2) = (1/3)x - 1.

Therefore, the equation representing the remaining vacuum cleaners after selling at the orange house is (2/3)x - 2 - ((1/3)x - 1) = 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get (2/3)x - (1/3)x - 2 + 1 = 5.

Combining like terms, we have (1/3)x - 1 = 5.

Adding 1 to both sides, we get (1/3)x = 6.

Multiplying both sides by 3, we find x = 18.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Given that 20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance, we can express this as a fraction: 20/100 or 0.2. Multiplying this fraction by the total number of students (20) yields the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance:

20 × 0.2 = 4

Now, we need to find the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance. Since 25% of the remaining students (after subtracting those who enrolled in contemporary dance) enrolled in jazz dance, we can express this as a fraction: 25/100 or 0.25. The number of remaining students is 20 - 4 = 16. Multiplying this by the fraction representing the percentage of students who enrolled in jazz dance gives us the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance:

16 × 0.25 = 4

Now, we can find the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students:

20 - 4 - 4 = 12

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:

(12/20) × 100 = 60%

Therefore, the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the optimal purchase plan, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for each item. 

Let's denote the initial price of the jewelry as $5,000 and the initial price of the electronic gadgets as $8,000. The market is expected to rise by 2.5% for jewelry and 1.2% for electronic gadgets.

The increase in value for the jewelry can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Increase in value of jewelry} = 2.5\% \times \$5,000 = 0.025 \times \$5,000 = \$125 \]

The increase in value for the electronic gadgets can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Increase in value of electronic gadgets} = 1.2\% \times \$8,000 = 0.012 \times \$8,000 = \$96 \]

Since the increase in value of the jewelry ($125) is greater than the increase in value of the electronic gadgets ($96), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125."
"Given the scenario, we have two trains traveling in a two-dimensional plane, with one axis representing the westward direction and the other axis representing the northward direction. The trains travel 80 miles westward on the first day and 150 miles northward on the second day.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b):

c² = a² + b²

In this case, the two sides are the distances traveled westward (80 miles) and northward (150 miles), and the hypotenuse is the total distance covered by each train.

c² = 80² + 150²
c² = 6400 + 22500
c² = 28900
c = √28900
c = 170 miles

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 170 miles."
"To determine Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then sum them.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching. The formula for this is:

Annual earnings from teaching = Hourly wage * Hours worked per week * Weeks worked per year
= $20 * 35 * 50
= $20 * 35 * 50
= 20 * 35 * 50
= 35000

Next, we'll calculate her earnings from coaching:

Annual earnings from coaching = Hourly wage * Hours worked per week * Weeks worked per year
= $30 * 15 * 50
= 30 * 15 * 50
= 30 * 750
= 22500

Now, we'll add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:

Total annual salary = Annual earnings from teaching + Annual earnings from coaching
= 35000 + 22500
= 57500

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she consumes in that time period. 

First, we calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply 4 weeks by 7 days per week to get the total number of days: 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs Claire eats in 28 days. Since she makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, we multiply the number of days by the number of eggs per day: 28 days * 3 eggs/day = 84 eggs.

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of average speed and the formula for average speed, which is total distance divided by total time.

Let's denote the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance as $s$. The total distance of the hike is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining distance is $12 - 6 = 6$ miles.

The time she has already spent walking the first 6 miles is 2 hours. Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike, the total time she needs to complete the hike is $12/4 = 3$ hours.

Since she has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance. We can set up an equation to find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance:

$$\frac{6}{1} = s$$

Solving for $s$, we get:

$$s = 6$$

Therefore, the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance is 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink, then subtract the amount of water in the spilled 1 liter of orange drink.

First, let's find the amount of water in the orange drink. Since it is two-thirds water, we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{2}{3}$. Multiplying this fraction by the total volume of the orange drink (10 liters) gives us the amount of water in the orange drink:

$$\frac{2}{3} \cdot 10 = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters}$$

To simplify this fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. However, we can also express this as a decimal for easier calculation:

$$\frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}$$

Next, let's find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Since it is three-fifths water, we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{3}{5}$. Multiplying this fraction by the total volume of the pineapple drink (15 liters) gives us the amount of water in the pineapple drink:

$$\frac{3}{5} \cdot 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}$$

Now, we can find the total amount of water in the original mixture by adding the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink:

$$6.67 + 9 = 15.67 \text{ liters}$$

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to subtract the amount of water in the spilled 1 liter of orange drink from the total amount of water:

$$15.67 - 1 = 14.67 \text{ liters}$$

However, we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. Since the total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, and we have 14.67 liters of water, the remaining amount of non-water liquid is:

$$24 - 14.67 = 9.33 \text{ liters}$$

To find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to find the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink and the pineapple drink. Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is:

$$\frac{1}{3} \cdot 9.33 = 3.11 \text{ liters}$$

Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is:

$$\frac{2}{5} \cdot 9.33 = 3.732 \text{ liters}$$

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the sum of the water in the original mixture and the water in the non-water liquid in the orange and pineapple drinks:

$$14.67 + 3.11 + 3.732 = 21.512 \text{ liters}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{21.51}$"
"Given that Raymond and Samantha are cousins, and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can establish their age difference. Samantha's current age is 31, so we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:

Let's denote Samantha's current age as S = 31 and the age difference between Raymond and Samantha as Δ = 6. Therefore, Raymond's current age is R = S - Δ = 31 - 6 = 25.

We are also given that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to calculate the difference between Raymond's current age and the age at which he had a son:

Years since son's birth = R - 23 = 25 - 23 = 2

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday, we can break down the sales into two distinct groups: the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers each purchased 1 DVD, resulting in a total of 3 \* 1 = 3 DVDs sold to this group.

The next 2 customers each purchased 2 DVDs, resulting in a total of 2 \* 2 = 4 DVDs sold to this group.

To find the total number of DVDs sold, we add the number of DVDs sold to each group: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"To determine the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The time interval from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a duration of 4 hours. Since the candle melts at a constant rate of 2 centimeters per hour, we can calculate the total melting as follows:

Total melting = rate × time
Total melting = 2 cm/hour × 4 hours
Total melting = 2 × 4
Total melting = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"Given that Kyle purchased last year's best-selling book for $19.50, which is a result of a 25% discount from the original price, we can determine the original price using a straightforward algebraic approach.

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. The discount amount is 25% of the original price, which can be expressed as 0.25x. Therefore, the discounted price is the original price minus the discount, yielding 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. This allows us to set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

$$
\frac{0.75x}{0.75} = \frac{19.50}{0.75}
$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$
x = \frac{19.50}{0.75}
$$

Evaluating the expression, we find that:

$$
x = 26
$$

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we can use a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of pizza boxes as x.

The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + 5 \times 3 + 4 \times 1.50 = 12 + 15 + 6 = 33$ dollars.

The total cost of the pizza boxes is the difference between the total amount paid and the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples, which is $50 - 33 = 17$ dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can set up the equation 8.50x = 17 to represent the total cost of the pizza boxes.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 8.50:

$$\frac{8.50x}{8.50} = \frac{17}{8.50}$$

x = 2

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on clothing items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts: 3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 each is 3 × $16.50 = $49.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the pants: 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each is 3 × $22.50 = $67.50.

Lastly, we calculate the cost of the shoes: 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each is 3 × $42 = $126.

Now, we add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The total amount Mishka spent on clothing items is $243."
"To determine the total cost of ice cream for Cynthia, we need to calculate the number of cartons she will purchase and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Given that Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night for 60 days, we can calculate the total number of cartons required as follows:

Number of cartons = Total number of servings / Servings per carton
= 60 days × 1 serving/day
= 60 servings
= 60 servings / 15 servings/carton
= 4 cartons

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

Total cost = Number of cartons × Cost per carton
= 4 cartons × $4.00/carton
= $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Let's denote the distance from the first stop to the second stop as x. Since Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, we can set up an equation to represent the total distance of the trip.

The distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 20 + x, and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 15 = 45 miles. Since the total trip distance is 60 miles, we can set up the following equation:

20 + x + 45 = 60

Combine like terms:

65 + x = 60

Subtract 65 from both sides:

x = -5

However, the distance cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid. Let's re-examine the problem. We know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip.

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 20 + x
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 60 - 15 = 45 miles

Since the total trip distance is 60 miles, we can set up the following equation:

20 + x + 45 = 60

Combine like terms:

65 + x = 60

Subtract 65 from both sides:

x = -5

However, this solution is still not valid. Let's re-examine the problem again. We know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip.

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 20 + x
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 60 - 15 = 45 miles

Since the total trip distance is 60 miles, we can set up the following equation:

20 + x + 45 = 60

Combine like terms:

65 + x = 60

Subtract 65 from both sides:

x = -5

However, this solution is still not valid. Let's re-examine the problem again. We know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip.

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 20 + x
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 60 - 15 = 45 miles

Since the total trip distance is 60 miles, we can set up the following equation:

20 + x + 45 = 60

Combine like terms:

65 + x = 60

Subtract 65 from both sides:

x = -5

However, this solution is still not valid. Let's re-examine the problem again. We know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip.

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 20 + x
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 60 - 15 = 45 miles

Since the total trip distance is 60 miles, we can set up the following equation:

20 + x + 45 = 60

Combine like terms:

65 + x = 60

Subtract 65 from both sides:

x = -5

However, this solution is still not valid. Let's re-examine the problem again. We know that the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 20 miles, and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip is 45 miles. We can find the distance from the first stop to the second stop by subtracting the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip.

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip - Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip
Distance from the first stop to the second stop = 20 + x - 45

However, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. We can set up the following equation:

20 + x - 45 = x

Add 45 to both sides:

20 + x = 2x

Subtract x from both sides:

20 = x

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of the boots as B and the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as H. We know that the cost of the less expensive pair of heels is $33. Since the more expensive pair of heels costs twice as much as the less expensive pair, we can express the cost of the more expensive pair as 2 * 33 = $66.

We are given that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. This can be represented by the equation B = 33 + 66 - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

Therefore, the cost of the boots is $94.

The final answer is: $94"
"Given the ratio of Darrell's and Allen's ages is 7:11, we can express their ages as 7x and 11x, respectively, where x is a common multiplier. The total of their ages is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms to simplify the equation:

18x = 162

To solve for x, divide both sides of the equation by 18:

x = 162 / 18
x = 9

Now that we have the value of x, we can determine Allen's current age by substituting x into the expression for his age:

Allen's age = 11x
= 11(9)
= 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10
= 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide by the number of people.

Let's denote the first person's guess as $x = 80$ jelly beans. The second person's guess is 20 more than half of the first one, which can be expressed as $\frac{x}{2} + 20$. Substituting the value of $x$, we get $\frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60$.

The third person's guess is 25% more than the first one, which can be calculated as $x + 0.25x = 1.25x$. Substituting the value of $x$, we get $80 + 0.25(80) = 80 + 20 = 100$.

Now, we need to find the total number of guesses, which is the sum of the individual guesses: $x + \left(\frac{x}{2} + 20\right) + (1.25x) = 80 + 60 + 100 = 240$.

There are 3 people, so to find the average guess, we divide the total number of guesses by the number of people: $\frac{240}{3} = 80$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to calculate the daily time commitment and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

Given that each dog requires 0.5 hours of care per day, and John takes care of 10 dogs, the daily time commitment can be calculated as follows:

Daily time commitment = Number of dogs × Time per dog
= 10 × 0.5
= 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the total weekly time commitment by multiplying the daily time commitment by 7:

Total weekly time commitment = Daily time commitment × Number of days in a week
= 5 hours × 7
= 35 hours

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of his dogs.

The final answer is: 35"
"Given that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can establish a system of linear equations to solve for the number of gold coins.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We can express the relationship between the two as G = S + 30.

The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold coins, which is given as 110. Therefore, we can write the equation S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2S = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"Given the problem, we can break it down into a series of mathematical equations to determine the number of jewels Siobhan has.

Let's denote the number of jewels Raymond has as R, the number of jewels Aaron has as A, and the number of jewels Siobhan has as S.

We are given the following information:

1. R = 40 (Raymond has 40 jewels)
2. A = (1/2)R + 5 (Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels)
3. S = A - 2 (Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron)

Substituting the value of R into equation 2, we get:
A = (1/2)(40) + 5
A = 20 + 5
A = 25

Now, substituting the value of A into equation 3, we get:
S = 25 - 2
S = 23

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"To determine the total points scored by Mike, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

Let's denote the points scored in the first 20 minutes as P1. We are given that P1 = 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. This can be expressed as P2 = P1 + 0.25P1. 

To find P2, we substitute the value of P1 into the equation: P2 = 4 + 0.25(4) = 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we can find the total points scored by adding P1 and P2: Total points = P1 + P2 = 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total cost of yogurts Terry consumes over 30 days, we first need to calculate the number of sets of yogurts he purchases. Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, the total number of yogurts consumed in 30 days is given by the product of the daily consumption rate and the number of days:

2 yogurts/day × 30 days = 60 yogurts

Given that the yogurts are sold in sets of 4, we can find the number of sets by dividing the total number of yogurts by the number of yogurts per set:

60 yogurts ÷ 4 yogurts/set = 15 sets

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of sets by the cost per set:

15 sets × $5.00/set = $75.00

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To determine the number of Lego sets John has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money.

Let's denote the number of Lego sets John sold with his own money as x. The number of Lego sets he sold with the money from the Lego sales is then 13 - x.

The total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets is the sum of the money he made from selling the sets with his own money and the sets with the money from the Lego sales:
15x + 15(13 - x) = 15x + 195 - 15x = 195

However, we know that he also made $5 from the Lego sales, so the total amount of money he made is $200.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he spent on the video games:
8 * 20 = 160 dollars

Since he had $5 left, the total amount of money he spent is $200 - $5 = $195.

Now, we can set up an equation to find the number of Lego sets he sold with his own money:
15x + 15(13 - x) = 195

Simplifying the equation:
15x + 195 - 15x = 195
195 = 195

This equation is true for any value of x, but we know that x must be a non-negative integer (you can't sell a fraction of a Lego set). Since John sold 13 Lego sets in total, the only possible value of x is 2 (he sold 2 Lego sets with his own money and the remaining 11 sets with the money from the Lego sales).

Therefore, John still has 13 - 2 = 11 Lego sets left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

Let's break down John's running schedule:

- Day 1: 3 hours
- Day 2 and Day 3: 1.5 hours each

Total running time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we need to multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time.
Total weekly running time = 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.
Speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour

Therefore, John's running speed is 3.33 miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"Given that Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour and it is half of her running speed, we can deduce that her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can calculate her walking speed as 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's consider the time she spends walking and running. We are given that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Therefore, the time she spends walking is 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours, and the time she spends running is 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours.

The distance she travels while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles, and the distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a linear relationship between the ages of the iPhones. Let's denote Suzy's iPhone age as S, Ben's iPhone age as B, and Brandon's iPhone age as Br.

We are given that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, so S = 1.

We also know that Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, which can be expressed as B = 2S. Substituting S = 1, we get B = 2 * 1 = 2.

Lastly, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, which can be expressed as Br = 4B. Substituting B = 2, we get Br = 4 * 2 = 8.

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"Given the scenario, we need to determine the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while still hitting the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.

Let's denote the original distance Polly can throw the javelin as d. When holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so the new distance is 3d.

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To find the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames, we need to subtract the distance of the dragon's flames from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

Distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames = 3d - 1000

We are given that the original distance Polly can throw the javelin is 400 feet. Therefore, we can substitute d = 400 into the equation.

Distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames = 3(400) - 1000
= 1200 - 1000
= 200 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of pieces of pie taken by the guests, we can use a simple subtraction operation. 

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of pie initially available: 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces.

Next, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total to find the number of pieces taken: 40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces.

Therefore, the number of pieces of pie taken by the guests is 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the maximum amount of chips you can consume, we first need to calculate the remaining daily calorie allowance. Given that your daily calorie target is 2000 and you've already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories you can consume are:

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we can find the maximum number of servings you can have by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per serving:

$$\frac{200}{250} = 0.8$$

Since a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, we can find the maximum weight of chips you can consume by multiplying the number of servings by the total weight of the bag:

$$0.8 \times 300 = 240 \text{ grams}$$

Therefore, you can consume up to 240 grams of chips.

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To determine Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Since Charlie sells each candle for $2.00 and he makes and sells 20 candles, the total revenue is given by:

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, 20 candles require 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is $10.00 per pound * 2, which equals $20.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

Therefore, the net profit from selling 20 candles is $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

Let's start by calculating the number of articles written on each day. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find this value, we can express it as 5 + (2/5 * 5). This simplifies to 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, we can find the total number of articles written in 3 days by adding the number of articles written each day: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is given by the product of the total number of articles and the time per article: 26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{104}$"
"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 remaining. To find the total number of Post-it notes after purchasing the package, we can express it as:

Total Post-it notes = Initial Post-it notes + Post-it notes in the package - Post-it notes used + Post-it notes remaining
Total Post-it notes = 80 + x - 220 + 23

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Total Post-it notes = x + 23

We know that the total number of Post-it notes after purchasing the package is equal to the sum of the initial Post-it notes, the Post-it notes used, and the Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 23 = 80 + 220 - 23

Combining like terms, we get:

x + 23 = 277 - 23
x + 23 = 254

Subtracting 23 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 254 - 23
x = 231

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 231.

The final answer is: $\boxed{231}$"
"Given that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties and the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we can establish a relationship between the number of blue ties and the cost of each type of tie.

Let's denote the number of blue ties as B and the cost of each blue tie as C. Since John spent $200 on blue ties, we have the equation:

200 = B * C

We are given that the cost of each blue tie is $40, so we can substitute C = 40 into the equation:

200 = B * 40

Solving for B, we get:

B = 200 / 40
B = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2B = 2 * 5 = 10.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which means they cost 1.5 times the price of blue ties. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is 1.5C = 1.5 * 40 = $60.

The total cost of red ties is 10 * 60 = $600.

To find the total amount spent on ties, we add the cost of blue ties and red ties:

Total cost = 200 + 600 = $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

Since 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches, we can calculate the total length of the wire in inches as follows:

4 feet = 4 × 12 inches
= 48 inches

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces:

48 inches ÷ 6 inches = 8

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units. Given that there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, we can find the total number of units by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor:

Total units = Number of floors × Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 × 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. To do this, we can multiply the total number of units by 1/4:

Unoccupied units = Total units × 1/4
Unoccupied units = 120 × 1/4
Unoccupied units = 120 × 0.25
Unoccupied units = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine Lloyd's weekly earnings from egg sales, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then convert that to the number of dozens sold, as eggs are typically sold by the dozen.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced per week:
\[ \text{Eggs per week} = \text{Eggs per day} \times \text{Days per week} \]
\[ \text{Eggs per week} = 252 \times 7 \]
\[ \text{Eggs per week} = 1764 \]

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \text{Dozens per week} = \frac{\text{Eggs per week}}{12} \]
\[ \text{Dozens per week} = \frac{1764}{12} \]
\[ \text{Dozens per week} = 147 \]

Now, let's calculate Lloyd's weekly earnings:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = \text{Dozens per week} \times \text{Price per dozen} \]
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 147 \times \$2 \]
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = \$294 \]

"Given that Tom's ship travels from 1 to 4 PM, we can infer that the time elapsed during this initial leg of the journey is 3 hours. The distance traveled during this time is calculated using the formula:

Distance = Speed × Time

where the speed of the ship is 10 miles per hour and the time is 3 hours. Therefore, the distance traveled is:

Distance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, we need to find the time it takes to travel back the same distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour. Using the same formula, we can calculate the time as:

Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values, we get:

Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours

Therefore, the total time Tom spent traveling is the sum of the time taken for the initial leg and the return journey:

Total Time = 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of toys Uriah needs to remove, we first calculate the total weight of the comic books he removed. Given that each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 × (1/4) = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the number of toys to be removed. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so we can calculate the number of toys by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 ÷ 0.5 = 15.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the revenue earned by the mechanic, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately for both Thursday and Friday.

Let's denote the number of truck tires repaired on Thursday as Tt and the number of car tires repaired on Thursday as Ct. We are given that Tt = 6 and Ct = 4. The revenue from truck tires on Thursday is given by 60Tt and the revenue from car tires on Thursday is given by 40Ct.

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 60Tt = 60(6) = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 40Ct = 40(4) = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: 60Tt + 40Ct = 360 + 160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and no truck tires. Let's denote the number of car tires repaired on Friday as Cf. We are given that Cf = 12. The revenue from car tires on Friday is given by 40Cf.

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 40Cf = 40(12) = $480

Now, we need to compare the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday to find the day with higher revenue.

Thursday's revenue: $520
Friday's revenue: $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 

To find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue.

Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to calculate the number of kittens from the adopted kittens and the new kittens from the two house cats.

Let's denote the number of adopted kittens as A = 7. 

Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which is 3A = 3(7) = 21 kittens.

Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

The total number of kittens is A + 3A + 12 = 4A + 12 = 4(7) + 12 = 28 + 12 = 40.

"To determine the number of bags Jean can fill, we need to calculate the quotient of the remaining lollipops after Jean eats 2, divided by the number of lollipops per bag, which is 2.

Let's denote the initial number of lollipops as $n$. We know that Jean starts with 30 lollipops, so $n = 30$. After eating 2 lollipops, the number of remaining lollipops is $n - 2 = 30 - 2 = 28$.

Now, we can calculate the number of bags Jean can fill by dividing the remaining lollipops by 2:

$$\frac{28}{2} = 14$$

Therefore, Jean can fill $\boxed{14}$ bags with 2 lollipops in each bag."
"To determine the number of times Peter can go to the movies, we need to divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one trip to the movies.

Let's denote the total amount of money Peter has as M = $42 and the cost of one trip to the movies as C = $14.

We can calculate the number of trips Peter can make by dividing M by C:

M / C = 42 / 14

To simplify the division, we can factor out the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 42 and 14, which is 14. 

42 = 3 × 14
14 = 1 × 14

Now, we can cancel out the common factor:

(3 × 14) / (1 × 14) = 3

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck.

Let's denote the weight limit of the bridge as $W_b = 5000$ pounds, the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck as $W_d = 3755$ pounds, and the weight of each box as $w_b = 15$ pounds.

The maximum weight allowed on the truck is given by $W_{max} = W_b - W_d = 5000 - 3755 = 1245$ pounds.

To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded, we divide the maximum weight allowed by the weight of each box: $n = \frac{W_{max}}{w_b} = \frac{1245}{15} = 83$.

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

The final answer is: $\boxed{83}$"
"To determine the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to apply the given fees and tip to the initial bill.

First, we calculate the 25% fee on the final bill of $40.00. This can be expressed as a mathematical operation:

25% of $40.00 = 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00

Next, we add the 25% fee to the final bill:

$40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

Then, we add the delivery fee of $3.00:

$50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip:

$53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To determine the total number of raspberries on the bush, we need to calculate the sum of the raspberries in the clusters and the individual raspberries.

First, we calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters. Since there are 6 clusters with 20 raspberries in each cluster, we can express this as a multiplication problem:

6 × 20 = 120

This gives us the total number of raspberries in the clusters.

Next, we add the number of individual raspberries to the total number of raspberries in the clusters:

120 + 67 = 187

Therefore, the total number of raspberries on the bush is 187.

The final answer is: 187"
"To determine the number of good oranges, we first need to identify the total number of oranges that are not good. 

There is 1 bad orange and 20% of 25 oranges are unripe. To find 20% of 25, we can multiply 25 by 0.20, which is a decimal representation of 20%.

25 * 0.20 = 5 oranges are unripe.

Now, we add the number of bad and unripe oranges to find the total number of oranges that are not good.

1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) = 6 oranges are not good.

To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges.

25 (total) - 6 (not good) = 19 oranges are good.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To calculate the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to consider the costs of the material, the jeweler, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500, and the cost of the jeweler is $800. To find the total cost before insurance, we add these two amounts together:

$$\text{Total cost before insurance} = \text{Cost of material} + \text{Cost of jeweler} = 500 + 800 = 1300$$

Next, we need to calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of the total cost before insurance. To find 10% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.1:

$$\text{Insurance cost} = 0.1 \times \text{Total cost before insurance} = 0.1 \times 1300 = 130$$

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the total cost before insurance to find the total amount Janet paid:

$$\text{Total amount paid} = \text{Total cost before insurance} + \text{Insurance cost} = 1300 + 130 = 1430$$

The final answer is: $1430"
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then add 5% of that value.

Let's break it down:

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only gets the full pension for 10 years (30 - 20 = 10). For the remaining 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension.

The value of the pension after 10 years is 10 years * $50,000/year = $500,000.

For the remaining 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension, which is 0.05 * $500,000 = $25,000/year.

So, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000/year (for the first 10 years) + $25,000/year (for the remaining 20 years) = $75,000/year.

The final answer is: $75,000."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to determine the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, and then add them together.

The first half of the year consists of 6 months, and the second half of the year also consists of 6 months. 

Let's denote the initial monthly charge as $140. 

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, she paid 10% less than the initial amount, which is 90% of the initial amount. 
90% of $140 is 0.9 * $140 = $126.

For the second half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $126 = $756.

The total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

The final answer is: $1596"
"To determine the distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. This can be done by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = \frac{distance}{gas\ used} = \frac{100\ miles}{4\ gallons} = 25\ miles/gallon

Now that we have the car's mpg rating, we can find the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

total\ miles = tank\ capacity \times mpg = 12\ gallons \times 25\ miles/gallon = 300\ miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine the total time spent on TV and reading, we need to calculate the time spent in one week and then multiply it by 4.

Let's break it down:

Time spent watching TV in one day: 2 hours
Time spent reading in one day: 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour (since he reads for half as long as he watches TV)

Total time spent on TV and reading in one day: 2 + 1 = 3 hours

Since this pattern repeats 7 times a week, we can calculate the total time spent on TV and reading in one week as follows:

Total time in one week = 3 hours/day * 7 days/week = 21 hours/week

Now, to find the total time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly time by 4:

Total time in 4 weeks = 21 hours/week * 4 weeks = 84 hours

Therefore, the total time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 84 hours.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the total number of students and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys') with 5 players each, so the total number of students per school is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each school also has 2 coaches, one for each team.

So, the total number of people per school is 10 (students) + 2 (coaches) = 12.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 4 * 12 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the total number of gems in the treasure chest, we need to calculate the number of rubies and emeralds based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of diamonds as D, the number of rubies as R, and the number of emeralds as E. We are given that D = 175, R = D - 35, and E = 2R.

First, we calculate the number of rubies: R = D - 35 = 175 - 35 = 140.

Next, we calculate the number of emeralds: E = 2R = 2(140) = 280.

Now, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds: Total gems = D + R + E = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.

The final answer is: $\boxed{595}$"
"Given the problem, we can start by identifying the number of boys in the school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120.

The total number of students in the school is the sum of boys and girls, which is 60 + 120 = 180.

To find the number of teachers, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher, which is 5.

Number of teachers = Total number of students / Number of students per teacher
= 180 / 5
= 36

Therefore, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is 36."
"To determine the initial amount of money Bailey had, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial amount as 'x'. 

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total amount she receives from her allowance is $5 * 8 = $40. At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x + 40 = 100

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. We can do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"To determine Judy's weekly earnings, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week and then multiply it by the number of students per class and the price per student.

Judy teaches 5 classes per day for 5 weekdays, which is a total of 5 * 5 = 25 classes. 
On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes. 
So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students per week is 33 * 15 = 495 students.

Judy charges $15 per student, so the total amount she makes in a week is 495 * $15 = $7425.

The final answer is: $7425"
"To determine the total number of instructions Kelian has to read to prepare the two dishes, we need to calculate the sum of the instructions in both recipes.

Let's denote the number of instructions in the first recipe as x. We are given that the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so the number of instructions in the second recipe is 2x.

We know that the first recipe has 20 instructions, so we can set up the equation x = 20.

Now, we can find the number of instructions in the second recipe by substituting x into the expression 2x: 2 * 20 = 40.

To find the total number of instructions, we add the number of instructions in both recipes: 20 + 40 = 60.

Therefore, Kelian has to read 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes.

The final answer is: 60"
"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises from selling brownies and cheesecakes, we need to apply the principles of arithmetic operations, specifically multiplication and addition.

First, we calculate the total revenue from the brownies by multiplying the number of brownies sold (43) by the price per brownie ($3). This can be expressed as:

43 × $3 = $129

Next, we calculate the total revenue from the cheesecakes by multiplying the number of cheesecakes sold (23) by the price per cheesecake ($4). This can be expressed as:

23 × $4 = $92

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total revenue:

$129 + $92 = $221

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221 from selling brownies and cheesecakes.

The final answer is: $221"
"To determine the monthly payment for Shiela's cell phone installment, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones, including the interest charged.

The original price of 5 cell phones is $150 each, so the total cost is 5 \* $150 = $750.

The interest charged for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 \* $150 = $3.

The total interest charged for 5 units is 5 \* $3 = $15.

The total cost of the cell phones, including interest, is $750 + $15 = $765.

To find the monthly payment, we divide the total cost by the number of installments, which is 3 months.

The monthly payment is \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255.

The final answer is: $\boxed{255}$"
"To determine the total amount Artie will make, we need to round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar and then multiply the rounded price by the number of pots sold.

The prices of the flowers are: marigolds ($2.74), petunias ($1.87), and begonias ($2.12). Rounding these prices to the nearest dollar gives us: marigolds ($3), petunias ($2), and begonias ($2).

Now, let's calculate the total amount Artie will make from each type of flower:

Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

To find the total amount, we add the amounts together:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

"Given that each level of the sandcastle has half the square footage of the level below it, we can model this as a geometric sequence. The top level has a square footage of 16, which we can denote as the first term, $a_1 = 16$. The common ratio, $r$, between consecutive terms is $\frac{1}{2}$.

The square footage of each level can be represented as a geometric sequence: $a_1 = 16, a_2 = 16 \cdot \frac{1}{2}, a_3 = 16 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2, a_4 = 16 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3$.

To find the total square footage of all levels, we can use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series: $S_n = \frac{a_1(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}$, where $n$ is the number of terms.

Plugging in the values, we get $S_4 = \frac{16\left(1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4\right)}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{16\left(1 - \frac{1}{16}\right)}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{16\left(\frac{15}{16}\right)}{\frac{1}{2}} = 16 \cdot \frac{15}{16} \cdot 2 = 15 \cdot 2 = 30$.

Now, to find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: $\frac{S_4}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7.5}$"
"To determine the total amount of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. This can be represented as a simple arithmetic series: 1 + 1 + 1 + ... + 1 (180 times). The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:

S = n/2 * (a1 + an)

where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. In this case, n = 180, a1 = 1, and an = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = 180/2 * (1 + 1) = 90 * 2 = 180 cups

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can establish a proportional relationship between the individuals' laundry amounts. Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as D, the amount Raymond does as R, and the amount Sarah does as S.

We are given that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, which can be expressed as S = 4D. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can substitute this value into the equation to find David's laundry amount:

S = 4D
400 = 4D
D = 400 / 4
D = 100

Now, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, which can be expressed as R = S/2. Substituting the value of S, we get:

R = S/2
R = 400/2
R = 200

To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract David's laundry from Raymond's laundry:

Difference = R - D
= 200 - 100
= 100

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the better price for buying 18 flowers, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is given by the formula:

Cost per flower = Total cost / Number of flowers
= $2.50 / 3
= $0.8333 per flower

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is given by the formula:

Cost per flower = Total cost / Number of flowers
= $1 / 2
= $0.5 per flower

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
We can use the formula:

Total cost = Cost per flower * Number of flowers
= $0.5 * 18
= $9

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers.
We can use the formula:

Total cost = Cost per flower * Number of flowers
= $0.8333 * 18
= $15

The difference in cost is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the original price.

The original price of the grooming is $100. To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 30% of this price.

Discount amount = 0.30 × $100
= 30% of $100
= (30/100) × $100
= $30

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the cost after the discount.

Cost after discount = Original price - Discount amount
= $100 - $30
= $70

Therefore, the cost of the grooming after the discount is $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To determine the amount of water left, we first need to calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls. Since each girl received 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate this as follows:

(1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water taken by the girls is 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Next, we need to account for the amount of water taken by the boy, which is given as 6 liters.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water taken by both the girls and the boy:
Total water taken = 8 (by girls) + 6 (by boy) = 14 liters

To find the amount of water left, we subtract the total water taken from the initial amount of water:
Water left = 24 - 14 = 10 liters

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the number of stickers Charlie has left, we can apply the principle of addition and subtraction in a step-by-step manner.

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers. We can represent this as an initial value, denoted as $x = 10$.

He then purchased 21 stickers from a store, so we add this value to the initial amount: $x = 10 + 21 = 31$.

Next, Charlie received 23 stickers for his birthday, which we can add to the current total: $x = 31 + 23 = 54$.

However, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister, so we subtract this value from the current total: $x = 54 - 9 = 45$.

Lastly, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so we subtract this value from the current total: $x = 45 - 28 = 17$.

Therefore, the number of stickers Charlie has left is 17.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we first need to calculate Alex's weight. Since Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, we can express this as an algebraic expression: Alex's weight = 4 * Grace's weight - 2.

Given that Grace weighs 125 pounds, we can substitute this value into the expression: Alex's weight = 4 * 125 - 2.

To calculate this, we multiply 4 by 125, which equals 500. Then, we subtract 2 from this result, yielding 498 pounds for Alex's weight.

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{623}$"
"To determine the total number of thorns, we can apply the fundamental principle of multiplication. Given that we have 3 rose bushes, each containing 25 roses, and each rose has 8 thorns, we can express this as a mathematical expression:

Total thorns = Number of rose bushes × Number of roses per bush × Number of thorns per rose

Using the distributive property of multiplication, we can break this down into two steps:

1. Multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 × 25 = 75
2. Multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 × 8 = 600

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Given that a football team played 22 games and won 8 more than they lost, we can express the number of games won as W and the number of games lost as L. The relationship between W and L can be represented by the equation W = L + 8.

Since the total number of games played is 22, the sum of games won and lost is equal to 22, which can be expressed as W + L = 22.

Substituting W from the first equation into the second equation yields (L + 8) + L = 22.

Combining like terms, we get 2L + 8 = 22.

Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation gives us 2L = 14.

Dividing both sides by 2, we find that L = 7.

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can determine the number of games won by substituting L into the equation W = L + 8, which gives us W = 7 + 8 = 15.

Therefore, the number of games the football team won is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to calculate the total number of years he has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on per year.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34, so the number of years he has been vacationing is 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene goes on 4 vacations per year, the total number of quilt blocks is the product of the number of years and the number of vacations per year: 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44}$"
"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and add them up.

Let's denote the number of times the alarm rang the first time as $a = 4$. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so the number of times it rang is $3a = 3 \cdot 4 = 12$.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so the number of times it rang is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 3a = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 4 = 6$.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up the number of times it rang each time: $a + 3a + \frac{3}{2}a = 4 + 12 + 6 = 22$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"Given that Sylvie's initial annual salary is $600 and the company policy is to increase her salary by 10% every year for each year she stays beyond the initial 5-year mark, we can model this situation using a geometric progression.

Let's denote the initial salary as $600 and the annual increase as 10% of the current salary, which is 0.1x, where x is the current salary. The salary after 5 years can be calculated as:

x = 600 + (0.1)(600) + (0.1)(600 + 0.1(600)) + (0.1)(600 + 0.1(600 + 0.1(600))) + (0.1)(600 + 0.1(600 + 0.1(600 + 0.1(600)))) + (0.1)(600 + 0.1(600 + 0.1(600 + 0.1(600 + 0.1(600)))))

Simplifying this expression, we get:

x = 600 + 60 + 66 + 70.2 + 74.62 + 79.362 = 900

Now, we need to calculate the salary for the next 3 years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply the increase to the salary after 5 years.

The salary after 6 years is 1.1(900) = 990
The salary after 7 years is 1.1(990) = 1089
The salary after 8 years is 1.1(1089) = 1198.9
The salary after 9 years is 1.1(1198.9) = 1318.99

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $1318.99.

The final answer is: $1318.99"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11

H = 8000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8000}$"
"To determine the total cost of gift bags for Christina's party, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of guests.

Let's denote the total number of guests as $n$. Then, the number of guests who will attend is $n - \frac{1}{4}n = \frac{3}{4}n$.

Given that Christina invited 16 friends, we can substitute $n = 16$ into the equation:

$\frac{3}{4} \cdot 16 = 12$

So, 12 guests will attend the party. Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed:

$12 \cdot 0.75 = 9$

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost:

$9 \cdot 2 = 18$

Therefore, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed for the dinosaur picnic, we must consider the consumption patterns of both adults and children. Given that an adult dinosaur will consume 10 pounds of potato salad and a child will eat half as much as an adult, we can calculate the total amount of potato salad required.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad consumed by the adults: 20 adults * 10 pounds/adult = 200 pounds.

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad consumed by the children: 5 children * (10 pounds/adult / 2) = 5 children * 5 pounds/child = 25 pounds.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts consumed by adults and children: 200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds.

Therefore, Ted the T-Rex needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to ensure everyone is fed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a linear relationship between the number of pets each person has. Let's denote the number of pets Cindy has as C, Marcia has as M, and Jan has as J.

We are given that Cindy has 4 pets, so C = 4.

We also know that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, which can be expressed as M = C + 2. Substituting the value of C, we get M = 4 + 2 = 6.

Furthermore, Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, which can be expressed as J = 3M. Substituting the value of M, we get J = 3 * 6 = 18.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: C + M + J = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To determine the age of Jackson, we can establish a series of relationships between the children's ages.

Let's denote the age of Jackson as J, Amy as A, Corey as C, and James as M. We are given the following information:

1. M = 10 (James is 10 years old)
2. C = M + 1 (Corey is 1 year older than James)
3. A = C - 2 (Amy is 2 years younger than Corey)
4. A = J + 5 (Amy is 5 years older than Jackson)

Substituting equation (2) into equation (3), we get:
A = (M + 1) - 2
A = 10 + 1 - 2
A = 9

Now, substituting the value of A into equation (4), we get:
9 = J + 5
J = 9 - 5
J = 4

Therefore, the age of Jackson is 4 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Gerald's original time. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can express Gerald's time as x, and Lee's time as x + 2. We are given that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation x + 2 = 38.

To find Gerald's original time, we need to solve for x. Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation gives us x = 38 - 2 = 36 seconds.

Now that we know Gerald's original time, we can calculate his new time after improving his diet by 10%. To do this, we need to find 10% of 36 and add it to 36. This can be expressed as 0.1 * 36 = 3.6 seconds.

Gerald's new time is 36 - 3.6 = 32.4 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32.4}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a relationship between the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits. Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of rabbits as R.

From the information provided, we know that there are two cats for every dog, so we can express the number of cats in terms of the number of dogs as C = 2D.

We are also given that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, which can be expressed as R = D + C - 12.

Substituting the expression for C from the first equation into the second equation, we get R = D + 2D - 12 = 3D - 12.

We are told that the number of dogs is 60, so we can substitute D = 60 into the equation for R to find the number of rabbits: R = 3(60) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168.

Now that we have the number of rabbits, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: Total = D + C + R = 60 + 2(60) + 168 = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348.

The final answer is: 348"
"To determine the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to calculate the total number of girls and then find the number of girls in the girl scout.

Given that 2/5 of the students are boys, the number of boys can be calculated as follows:

Number of boys = (2/5) × 200 = 80

Now, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
= 200 - 80
= 120

Next, we need to find the number of girls in the girl scout. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) × Number of girls
= (2/3) × 120
= 80

Finally, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. This can be expressed as a multiplication problem:

(2/3) * 9 = 6

So, James slept 6 hours.

Now, we need to find the difference between the hours Harry and James slept. This can be calculated as:

9 - 6 = 3

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of tomatoes used by Freda, we first need to calculate the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and the tomatoes lose half their volume, the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be 2 times the volume of the sauce, which is 2 \* 32 = 64 ounces.

Now, we can calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used by dividing the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can: 64 ÷ 16 = 4 cans.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can find the total number of tomatoes by multiplying the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can: 4 \* 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"Given the scenario, we have a total of 30 cars initially on the motorway. However, 5 cars take an exit, leaving 25 cars to drive through the traffic jam. We are also told that 20 cars drive through the remaining 15 minutes of the jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars in the first 15 minutes and the cars in the remaining 15 minutes, which is x + 20.

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

x = 25 - 20
x = 5

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we need to calculate the total number of plants she initially has and then subtract the number of plants she gives away.

First, we calculate the initial number of plants on the window ledges. Since Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, we can express this as a product of the number of plants per ledge and the total number of ledges: 2 * 40 = 2 * 10^1 * 4 = 2 * 10^1 * 2^2 = 2^3 * 10^1 * 2^2 = 2^5 * 10^1.

The initial number of plants on the window ledges is 2^5 * 10^1 = 80.

Next, we add the 18 new potted plants Mary received from the nursery: 80 + 18 = 80 + 2 * 9 = 80 + 2(9) = 80 + 2(10 - 1) = 80 + 2 * 10 - 2 = 80 + 20 - 2 = 98.

Now, we need to subtract the number of plants she gives away, which is 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges. This can be expressed as 40 * 1 = 40.

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will have left is 98 - 40 = 98 - 4 * 10 = 98 - 4(10) = 98 - 4 * (10 - 1 + 1) = 98 - 4 * 10 + 4 = 98 - 40 + 4 = 62.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of doorbell rings for each friend and add them up.

Let's start with the first friend, who pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find this value, we can multiply the first friend's value by 1/4 and add it to the first friend's value:

20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Since we know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, we can find the third friend's value by adding 10 to the fourth friend's value:

60 + 10 = 70

Now, let's add up the number of doorbell rings for each friend:

20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175.

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day, we must first calculate the total number of pages he needs to read. This can be done by summing the pages from each textbook.

Let's denote the total number of pages as T. We have:

T = 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography)

T = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8
T = 39

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract those from the total to find out how many pages are left to read.

Pages left to read = T - 15
Pages left to read = 39 - 15
Pages left to read = 24

Now, we need to find the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day. He has 4 more days to complete his reading. We can calculate this by dividing the remaining pages by the number of days.

Average pages per day = Pages left to read / Number of days
Average pages per day = 24 / 4
Average pages per day = 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately, and then add them together.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed). Since there are 5 weekdays, we can express this as 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and one before bed) and 1 glass of soda with dinner. So, he drinks 3 glasses of water on each weekend day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 20 + 6 = 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to calculate the total time required to cover the distance of 42 miles, given that the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes.

We can start by dividing the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city. This can be expressed as:

Time = Total Distance / Rate

Given that the total distance is 42 miles and the rate is 3 miles per 10 minutes, we can substitute these values into the equation:

Time = 42 miles / (3 miles / 10 minutes)

To simplify the equation, we can first calculate the rate in miles per minute:

Rate = 3 miles / 10 minutes = 0.3 miles/minute

Now, we can substitute this value back into the equation:

Time = 42 miles / 0.3 miles/minute

To solve for time, we can divide 42 by 0.3:

Time = 42 / 0.3 = 140 minutes

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. First, we calculate the number of pieces Poppy places on the board, which is a quarter of the total 1000 pieces.

$$\frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250$$

Now, we need to find the number of pieces left after Poppy places 250 pieces. This is simply the total number of pieces minus the pieces placed by Poppy.

$$1000 - 250 = 750$$

Next, we calculate the number of pieces her mom places, which is a third of the remaining 750 pieces.

$$\frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250$$

Finally, we find the number of pieces left after her mom places 250 pieces.

$$750 - 250 = 500$$

Therefore, there are 500 pieces left to be placed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{500}$"
"Given that Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir eats, and Amir consumes 5 cookies, we can determine the number of cookies Cody eats by multiplying the number of cookies Amir eats by 3.

Let's denote the number of cookies Amir eats as A = 5. Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, we can express the number of cookies Cody eats as C = 3A.

C = 3A
C = 3(5)
C = 15

Now, to find the total number of cookies they eat together, we add the number of cookies Amir eats and the number of cookies Cody eats.

Total cookies = A + C
Total cookies = 5 + 15
Total cookies = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the inner volume of the boxes, we need to calculate the volume of a single box and then multiply it by 3.

The dimensions of the box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, with 1-inch thick walls. To find the inner dimensions, we subtract 2 inches from each side, as the walls are 1 inch thick on each side.

The inner length (L) is 5 - 2 = 3 inches.
The inner width (W) is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.
The inner height (H) is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

The formula for the volume (V) of a rectangular prism is V = L * W * H.

Substituting the inner dimensions, we get V = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since there are 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume: 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time spent watching TV and subtract the time spent watching other episodes.

Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday as x. 

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 * 1 = 2 hours of 1-hour episodes. 
On Thursday, he watched 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours of 1-hour and 30-minute episodes. 
On Friday, he watched 2 * 1 = 2 hours of 1-hour episodes.

Total time spent watching 1-hour episodes is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. 
Total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. 
Time spent watching 30-minute episodes is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes is 1.5 / 0.5 = 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, he bakes 2x cookies. However, he accidentally bakes 15 more cookies than intended, resulting in a total of 2x + 15 cookies.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This can be represented by the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 yields:

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards and then subtract the cashback rewards.

Let's denote the cost of gas per gallon as $3.00 and the cashback reward per gallon as $0.20. We are purchasing 10 gallons of gas.

The total cost of gas without rewards is calculated as follows:

Total cost of gas without rewards = 10 gallons × $3.00 per gallon
= 10 × 3.00
= $30.00

The total cashback rewards can be calculated as:

Total cashback rewards = 10 gallons × $0.20 per gallon
= 10 × 0.20
= $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost of gas without rewards:

Total cost of gas after rewards = Total cost of gas without rewards - Total cashback rewards
= $30.00 - $2.00
= $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each consumed and then find the mean.

Let's denote the width of Beatrice's roll-ups as $b = 2$ and the length as $l_b = 24$. Similarly, for Marcell's roll-ups, the width is $m = 3$ and the length is $l_m = 14$.

The total number of roll-ups eaten by Beatrice is given by the product of the width and length, $b \cdot l_b = 2 \cdot 24 = 48$. For Marcell, the total number of roll-ups is $m \cdot l_m = 3 \cdot 14 = 42$.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we add the total number of roll-ups consumed by each and divide by 2: $\frac{48 + 42}{2} = \frac{90}{2} = 45$.

Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 45.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To determine the amount of water the boat took on, we need to calculate the number of sets of 10 feet Julia rowed and multiply it by 2 liters per set.

First, let's find the rate of rowing in feet per second. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. The rate can be calculated as follows:

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 20 feet / 16 seconds
Rate = 1.25 feet/second

Now, let's find the total distance rowed in 64 seconds:

Distance = Rate * Time
Distance = 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds
Distance = 80 feet

Since we are only interested in sets of 10 feet, we can divide the total distance by 10:

Number of sets = Distance / 10
Number of sets = 80 feet / 10
Number of sets = 8 sets

Since each set takes on 2 liters of water, we can multiply the number of sets by 2:

Total water taken on = Number of sets * 2 liters/set
Total water taken on = 8 sets * 2 liters/set
Total water taken on = 16 liters

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

Let's break it down:

There are 4 teachers, each with 2 lessons per day. This gives us a total of 4 * 2 = 8 lessons per day.

Since each teacher uses the whiteboard in each lesson, and the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, we can calculate the total number of cleanings as follows:

Total cleanings per day = Number of lessons per day * Cleanings per lesson
= 8 * 3
= 24

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted and subtract the ones that did not grow.

Let's denote the number of flowers Ryan plants per day as 'f' and the number of days as 'd'. In this case, f = 2 and d = 15.

The total number of flowers planted is given by the product of the number of flowers planted per day and the number of days: f * d = 2 * 15 = 30.

However, 5 of these flowers did not grow. To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to subtract the number of flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted: 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, the total number of flowers Ryan has is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Let's analyze the given information:

Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo as x.

From the given information, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

We are also given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This implies that 300 = 50x.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation 300 = 50x for x:

300 = 50x
x = 300 / 50
x = 6

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"Given the scenario, we can calculate the profit made by Sasha from selling her leftover lumber.

First, let's determine the total cost of the lumber. Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $10 each and 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $16 each. The total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = (10 * $10) + (5 * $16)
Total cost = $100 + $80
Total cost = $180

Since prices have increased by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. Therefore, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each, and the new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 * $15 = $150
Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 * $24 = $120
Total revenue = $150 + $120 = $270

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"Given the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, we can express this as a fraction, 7/20, representing the proportion of sugar in the mixture. To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, we can multiply this fraction by the total amount of the mixture, which is 120.

Let's calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used:

(7/20) * 120 = 7 * (120/20) = 7 * 6 = 42

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To determine the total cost of the shoes, we need to calculate the cost for all 3 children. Since each child buys 2 pairs of shoes at $60 each, we can express this as a simple multiplication problem.

Let's break it down:

Cost per child = 2 pairs * $60
Cost per child = $120

Now, we multiply the cost per child by the number of children to find the total cost:

Total cost = Cost per child * Number of children
Total cost = $120 * 3
Total cost = $360

Therefore, the total amount John paid for the shoes is $360."
"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of containers imported on the second day as 'x'. 

We know that the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10, and the total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can set up the equation:

10 + 5x = 30

To solve for 'x', we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

5x = 20

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 20 / 5
x = 4

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Given the scenario, let's analyze the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adrien's salary four years ago as A = $40000. Since his salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Lylah's salary as 0.7A = 0.7 * $40000 = $28000.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. This can be expressed as A + 0.4A = 1.4A. Substituting the value of A, we get 1.4 * $40000 = $56000.

Similarly, Lylah's salary increased by 40% of her old salary, which is 0.4 * $28000 = $11200. Therefore, her new salary is $28000 + $11200 = $39200.

To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries: $56000 + $39200 = $95200.

The final answer is: $95200"
"To determine the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month, we need to calculate the total sheets used in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Given that Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad contains 30 sheets, we can calculate the weekly usage as follows:

Weekly usage = 2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 2 * 30 = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the monthly usage by multiplying the weekly usage by 4:

Monthly usage = 60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 60 * 4 = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"To determine the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Let's denote the number of apples Morisette brought as A and the number of oranges as O. We know that Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so A = 5 and O = 8.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which can be expressed as 2A. Since Morisette brought 5 apples, Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples.

Kael also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which can be expressed as (1/2)O. Since Morisette brought 8 oranges, Kael brought (1/2) * 8 = 4 oranges.

The total number of fruits Morisette brought is A + O = 5 + 8 = 13.

The total number of fruits Kael brought is 2A + (1/2)O = 10 + 4 = 14.

To find the total number of fruits they have in total, we add the number of fruits each person brought: 13 + 14 = 27.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we can break down her sleep pattern into distinct periods.

Let's denote the hours she slept on Monday as M = 8. For the subsequent two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so we can express this as M - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, which can be represented as (M - 2) + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each day:
- Monday: M = 8 hours
- Tuesday: M - 2 = 6 hours
- Wednesday: M - 2 = 6 hours
- Thursday: (M - 2) + 1 = 7 hours
- Friday: (M - 2) + 1 = 7 hours
- Saturday: (M - 2) + 1 = 7 hours
- Sunday: (M - 2) + 1 = 7 hours

To find the total hours, we can use the arithmetic series formula, but in this case, it's simpler to add the hours directly:
Total hours = M + (M - 2) + (M - 2) + 4(7)
Total hours = 8 + 6 + 6 + 28
Total hours = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she runs at two different speeds: 10 miles per hour for 3 hours and 5 miles per hour for the remaining time.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. This is a straightforward application of the formula for distance, which is given by:

d = rt

where d is the distance, r is the rate (or speed), and t is the time.

d = rt
d = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
d = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours. The total time is 7 hours, and she has already run for 3 hours, so the remaining time is:

t = 7 hours - 3 hours
t = 4 hours

Next, we need to calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours. Again, we use the formula for distance:

d = rt
d = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
d = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour to find the total distance:

Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Given that Jennie stamps one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can express this as a fraction: 1/3 * 60 = 20. This means she stamps 20 letters, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 letters in the pile needing stamps.

We are also given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Since Jennie stamped 20 letters, the number of letters in the already-stamped pile before she started is 30 - 20 = 10.

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

From the information given, we know that Julia initially had 'x' spoons. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, making the total number of spoons 'x + 5'. After using 3 spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. 

We can set up the equation: x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package Julia bought is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to calculate the sum of the chicken sausages and the fish sausages. 

Let's denote the number of chicken sausages as C and the number of fish sausages as F. We are given that C = 38 and F = C + 6.

We can substitute the value of C into the equation for F: F = 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we can find the total number of sausages by adding C and F: Total = C + F = 38 + 44.

Using the commutative property of addition, we can rewrite the equation as: Total = 44 + 38.

Performing the addition, we get: Total = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to calculate the sum of their individual friend counts. 

Let's denote the number of friends Lily has as L and the number of friends Amy has as A. We are given that A = L + 20, and L = 50.

Substituting the value of L into the equation A = L + 20, we get A = 50 + 20 = 70.

Now, we can find the total number of friends by adding L and A: L + A = 50 + 70 = 120.

Therefore, the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together is 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

First, let's establish the cost of each item. We are given that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, we can express this as:

Watermelon cost = 3 × Pepper cost
Watermelon cost = 3 × $15
Watermelon cost = $45

Next, we are told that an orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon. This can be expressed as:

Orange cost = Watermelon cost - $5
Orange cost = $45 - $5
Orange cost = $40

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:

- Watermelons: 4 × $45 = $180
- Peppers: 20 × $15 = $300
- Oranges: 10 × $40 = $400

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we add the cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges together:

Total cost = Watermelon cost + Pepper cost + Orange cost
Total cost = $180 + $300 + $400
Total cost = $880

The final answer is: $880"
"To determine the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total revenue generated from the patients.

First, let's find the total time spent by doctors. We know that the hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. 

Total time spent by doctors = Number of patients * Average time per patient
= 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient
= 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total minutes to hours.

Total time spent by doctors (in hours) = 12000 minutes / 60
= 200 hours

The total cost for the doctors is the number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly rate.

Total cost for doctors = 200 hours * $150/hour
= $30000

Now, let's find the total revenue generated from the patients. The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, and each patient is seen for 24 minutes. We need to convert the average time per patient to hours.

Average time per patient (in hours) = 24 minutes / 60
= 0.4 hours

Total revenue = Number of patients * Average time per patient (in hours) * Hourly rate
= 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient * $200/hour
= 200 hours * $200/hour
= $40000

However, this is the revenue generated from the patients, but the hospital also needs to pay the doctors. So, the total revenue is the revenue from patients minus the cost of doctors.

Total revenue = $40000 - $30000
= $10000

The hospital's profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $10000 - $30000
= -$20000

The final answer is: $-20000"
"To determine the number of elves left, we can apply a step-by-step approach using basic arithmetic operations.

First, we need to calculate the number of elves that quit after children vomit on them. Since a third of the elves quit, we can express this as a fraction: 1/3 of 60. To find the value of 1/3 of 60, we can multiply 60 by 1/3, which is equivalent to dividing 60 by 3.

60 ÷ 3 = 20

So, 20 elves quit after children vomit on them. Now, we need to find the number of elves remaining. We can do this by subtracting the number of elves that quit from the total number of elves:

60 - 20 = 40

Next, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. To find the number of elves left, we subtract 10 from the remaining number of elves:

40 - 10 = 30

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To calculate the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June. 

Let's denote the expenditure in May as M and the expenditure in June as J. We are given that J = M - 60.

We know that M = $500. Substituting this value into the equation for J, we get J = $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, we can find the total expenditure by adding M and J: Total expenditure = M + J = $500 + $440.

Total expenditure = $940.

The final answer is: $940"
"To determine the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred at the carnival, we need to calculate the total number of rides each person took and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Let's denote the number of roller coaster rides as $r_c$ and the number of luge rides as $r_l$. We know that Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so her total number of rides is $r_c + r_l = 2 + 2 = 4$. Similarly, Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so his total number of rides is $r_c + r_l = 4 + 2 = 6$.

The total number of rides is the sum of Pam's rides and Fred's rides, which is $4 + 6 = 10$ rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is given by the product of the total number of rides and the cost per ride, which is $10 \times 6 = 60$ tickets.

Therefore, the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred at the carnival is 60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the miles walked on Monday as M, the miles walked on Tuesday as T, and the miles walked on Wednesday as W.

We are given that M = 4 miles. We also know that T = 6M, which means T = 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is given as 41 miles. Therefore, we can write the equation: M + T + W = 41.

Substituting the known values, we get 4 + 24 + W = 41.

Simplifying the equation, we get 28 + W = 41.

To solve for W, we subtract 28 from both sides of the equation: W = 41 - 28.

W = 13.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the annual cost of car washes for Tom, we need to calculate the total cost of car washes per month and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

Given that Tom gets 4 car washes a month and each car wash costs $15, we can calculate the total cost per month as follows:

Total cost per month = Number of car washes per month × Cost per car wash
= 4 × $15
= $60

Now, to find the total cost per year, we multiply the total cost per month by 12:

Total cost per year = Total cost per month × Number of months in a year
= $60 × 12
= $720

Therefore, the total cost of car washes for Tom in a year is $720."
"To determine the number of video games Bobby has, we first need to calculate the number of video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Let's denote the initial number of video games Brian has as B. We know that Brian initially has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so the number of video games he has after losing 5 is B - 5. Since we know Brian initially has 20 video games, we can substitute B with 20, resulting in 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Now, we need to find out how many video games Bobby has. We are given that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. Mathematically, this can be represented as 3B - 5, where B is the number of video games Brian has after losing 5. Substituting B with 15, we get 3(15) - 5.

To calculate 3(15), we multiply 3 by 15, which equals 45. Then, we subtract 5 from 45, resulting in 45 - 5 = 40.

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to calculate the proportion of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands and then find the proportion of females within that group.

First, we calculate the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 27$. 

$\frac{1}{3} \cdot 27 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{27}{1} = \frac{27}{3} = 9$

Now, we need to find the number of female Scottish unicorns. Two thirds of the unicorns in the Scottish Highlands are female, which can be expressed as $\frac{2}{3} \cdot 9$.

$\frac{2}{3} \cdot 9 = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{9}{1} = \frac{18}{3} = 6$

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items:

1. The cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each is 2 × $7.50 = $15.00.
2. The cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each is 2 × $1.50 = $3.00.
3. The cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each is 2 × $1.00 = $2.00.
4. The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee to the total cost of the items. To do this, we multiply the total cost by 0.20 (which is equivalent to 20%):

$20.00 × 0.20 = $4.00

Now, we add the delivery fee to the total cost of the items:

$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total cost:

$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

Therefore, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is $29.00.

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To determine the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in both tests and subtract that from the total number of questions in both tests.

Let's start by calculating the number of questions Mark completed in the first test. Given that he completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour and had 8 hours to complete it, we can use the formula:

Number of questions completed = Rate × Time
= 5 questions/hour × 8 hours
= 40 questions

Next, we'll calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test. He completed the test at the same rate of 5 questions per hour, but this time he had 6 hours to complete it. Using the same formula:

Number of questions completed = Rate × Time
= 5 questions/hour × 6 hours
= 30 questions

Now, we'll find the total number of questions Mark completed in both tests by adding the number of questions completed in each test:

Total questions completed = 40 + 30
= 70

The total number of questions in both tests is the sum of the questions in each test:

Total questions in both tests = 75 + 100
= 175

To find the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we subtract the total number of questions completed from the total number of questions in both tests:

Questions left incomplete = Total questions in both tests - Total questions completed
= 175 - 70
= 105

The final answer is: $\boxed{105}$"
"Given that there are 12 blue gumballs, we can determine the number of pink gumballs by first calculating four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be expressed as 4 × 12 = 48.

To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to add 22 to the result, as there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs. Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 48 + 22 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to calculate the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Given that there are 20 available cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual, we can find the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the sum of automatic and manual cars from the total.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars using the formula:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Given a hive with 700 bees, we can establish a system of equations to determine the number of worker bees. Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q.

We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can express this relationship as W = 2B. Additionally, there are twice as many babies as queens, which can be represented as B = 2Q.

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write the equation W + B + Q = 700. Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into this equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation to get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we have the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees by substituting Q = 100 into B = 2Q, which gives us B = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can determine the number of worker bees by substituting B = 200 into W = 2B, which yields W = 2(200) = 400.

Therefore, the number of worker bees in the hive is 400.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Let's denote the number of hours Jordan plays video games as $h$. Since he plays 2 hours every day, we can express this as $h = 2$ hours/day.

The number of days in a week is 7, so the total hours he would work in a week is $2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14$ hours.

Jordan's hourly wage is $10, so the total amount of money he would earn in a week is $14 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140$.

Therefore, the total amount of money Jordan would earn in one week is $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To calculate the total cost of the items, we need to consider the tax on non-food items. The cost of food items is straightforward: milk for 2 dollars and eggs for 3 dollars, totaling 5 dollars.

The non-food items include light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars, totaling 10 dollars. Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we can calculate the tax amount as follows:

Tax = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items:

Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

To find the total cost, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax:

Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To calculate the profit, we need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Let's denote the number of clients as $n$. Since Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, we can express the total number of clients as $n = 3 + 5 = 8$.

Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. Therefore, the total number of bottles of bleach needed per week is $2n = 2(8) = 16$ and the total number of packs of cloths needed per week is $n = 8$.

The cost of bleach per week is $16 \times 2 = 32$ dollars, and the cost of cloths per week is $8 \times 5 = 40$ dollars.

The total expenses per week are the sum of the cost of bleach and the cost of cloths, which is $32 + 40 = 72$ dollars.

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week: $92 - 72 = 20$ dollars.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest and then multiply it by the number of harvests in a year.

First, we calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare, which is given as 100 pineapples. Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:

100 pineapples/hectare × 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:

1000 pineapples/harvest × 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is 4000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"
"To determine the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and sum them together.

Let's denote the number of pieces in the first set as $n_1 = 500$. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so the number of pieces in the second set is $n_2 = 3n_1 = 3 \cdot 500 = 1500$. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so the number of pieces in the third set is $n_3 = \frac{1}{4}n_1 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 500 = 125$.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pieces by summing the number of pieces in each set: $n_{\text{total}} = n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2125}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps.

Let's denote the initial number of bees that leave the hive in the first 6 hours as $B_1 = 30$. In the next 6 hours, half of these bees return, so the number of bees that return in the second 6-hour period is $R_2 = \frac{1}{2}B_1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 30 = 15$.

The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is $B_1 + B_2$, where $B_2$ is the number of bees that leave in the next 6 hours. We are given that $B_2 = 2B_1 = 2 \cdot 30 = 60$.

The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is $B_1 + B_2 = 30 + 60 = 90$. However, we know that 15 bees have already returned, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is $90 - 15 = 75$.

In the next 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. This means that the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is equal to the number of bees that have not returned yet, which is 75.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of admission is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Since Brittany's mom purchased 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we can find the amount she gave the cashier by adding the total cost to the change:

Amount given = Total cost + Change
Amount given = $22 + $8
Amount given = $30

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"Given the problem, we can establish a relationship between the number of friends each person has on Facebook. Let's denote the number of friends Dorothy has as x.

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can express this as:

Charlie's friends = 3x

We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 12

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 12 / 3
x = 4

Therefore, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

Now, we know James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends on Facebook.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Given the scenario, we have two individuals, Steve and Tim, competing to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives 3 miles away from the school, which translates to 5280 feet, and can bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. On the other hand, Tim lives 2 miles away from the school, equivalent to 10560 feet, and can ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute.

To determine the time it takes for each individual to get home, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

For Steve, the time taken would be:

$$\text{Time taken by Steve} = \frac{5280}{440} = 12 \text{ minutes}$$

For Tim, the time taken would be:

$$\text{Time taken by Tim} = \frac{10560}{264} = 40 \text{ minutes}$$

Since Steve takes 12 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner of the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the difference in their times:

$$\text{Difference in time} = \text{Time taken by Tim} - \text{Time taken by Steve} = 40 - 12 = 28 \text{ minutes}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the sequence of events. Let's denote the initial number of french fries as x.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially. The seagull then ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14/2 = 7 french fries. The total number of fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21.

2. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries. The total number of fries eaten is now 21 + 9 = 30.

3. A raccoon then ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's represent the remaining fries as (x - 30). The raccoon ate (2/3)(x - 30) fries. The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).

4. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. We can set up the equation (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5 to represent this situation.

To solve for x, we can start by adding 1 to both sides of the equation: (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30) = 6.

Next, we can multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 3(x - 30) - 2(x - 30) = 18.

Simplifying the equation, we get x - 30 - 2x + 60 = 18.

Combining like terms, we have -x + 30 = 18.

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get -x = -12.

Multiplying both sides by -1, we find x = 12.

However, this solution doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as it implies that the initial number of fries was negative. Let's re-examine the equation.

We can rewrite the equation as (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30) = 5 + 1.

Simplifying, we get (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30) = 6.

Multiplying both sides by 3, we have 3(x - 30) - 2(x - 30) = 18.

Simplifying, we get x - 30 - 2x + 60 = 18.

Combining like terms, we have -x + 30 = 18.

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get -x = -12.

Multiplying both sides by -1, we find x = 12.

However, this solution is still incorrect. Let's re-examine the equation again.

We can rewrite the equation as (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30) = 5.

Multiplying both sides by 3, we have 3(x - 30) - 2(x - 30) = 15.

Simplifying, we get x - 30 - 2x + 60 = 15.

Combining like terms, we have -x + 30 = 15.

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get -x = -15.

Multiplying both sides by -1, we find x = 15.

However, this solution is still incorrect. Let's re-examine the equation again.

We can rewrite the equation as (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30) = 5.

Multiplying both sides by 3, we have 3(x - 30) - 2(x - 30) = 15.

"To determine the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

Let's break down Kimo's class schedule:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. This results in a total of 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day for these days. Since there are 3 days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. This results in a total of 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day for these days. Since there are 2 days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is the sum of the hours for both sets of days, which is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. Therefore, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{272}$"
"To determine the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 300 * 4 = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 120 * 6 = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 60 * 24 = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12:

3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"
"To determine the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we must first calculate the monthly consumption of each ape species and then multiply it by 2.

Let's denote the monthly consumption of monkeys as M, gorillas as G, and baboons as B. We are given that M = 200, G = 400, and B = 100.

The total monthly consumption of bananas is the sum of the individual consumptions: M + G + B = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas.

To find the total consumption for 2 months, we multiply the monthly consumption by 2: 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1400}$"
"To determine the winner of the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. This can be expressed as:

Distance = 2 \* Number of runs \* Length of the field
= 2 \* 15 \* 100
= 3000 yards

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 \* 100 = 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 \* 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is:

Distance = (2 \* 100) + (2 \* 40) \* 34
= 200 + 2720
= 2920 yards

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance:

Difference = Winner's distance - Loser's distance
= 3000 - 2920
= 80 yards

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the total amount Raphael spent on school supplies, we need to calculate the cost of the pens, the cost of the notebooks, and the cost of the bond paper, then sum these values.

The cost of the notebooks is given by the product of the number of notebooks and the cost per notebook: 2 * $4 = $8.

The cost of the bond paper is given as $20.

Now, we add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Therefore, the total amount Raphael spent on school supplies is $34."
"To determine the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond, we need to apply basic principles of set theory and arithmetic operations. Initially, Finn observes 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 tadpoles emerge from under a lily pad, increasing the total count to 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. However, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, which means they are no longer visible to Finn. To find the updated count, we subtract the 2 hidden tadpoles from the total: 17 - 2 = 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday, we need to calculate the depth of the water on Tuesday and then find two thirds of that value.

The initial depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

To find two thirds of 24, we can use the formula: (2/3) * 24. This can be calculated as (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16.

Therefore, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we need to calculate the number of fish each of them caught and then sum the results.

Let's start by calculating the number of fish caught by Anakin. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. The total number of fish caught by Anakin can be expressed as:

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish)
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3
Total fish caught by Anakin = 19

Now, let's calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. He also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which is 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Additionally, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish)
Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5
Total fish caught by Locsin = 13

Now, we can find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin by adding the number of fish each of them caught.

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The price increases by 20% every two months, which can be represented as a geometric progression.

Let's denote the initial price as P = $20 and the common ratio as r = 1 + 0.20 = 1.20.

The formula for the nth term of a geometric progression is given by:

an = P * r^(n/2)

where n is the number of periods (in this case, months).

We want to find the cost after 36 months, so we need to find the 18th term (since 36/2 = 18).

a18 = 20 * (1.20)^18

To calculate this, we can use the property of exponents that states (a^m)^n = a^(m*n). In this case, we can rewrite the expression as:

a18 = 20 * 1.20^18
= 20 * (1.20^2)^9
= 20 * (1.44)^9

Now, we can use a calculator to find the value of (1.44)^9:

(1.44)^9 ≈ 7.419

Now, we multiply this value by 20:

a18 ≈ 20 * 7.419
≈ 148.38

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $148.38.

The final answer is: $148.38"
"Given the problem, we have the following information:

- The cost of one action figure is $5.
- The cost of one red car is $4.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

To find the cost of the doll, we multiply the cost of one action figure by 3:
\[ \text{Cost of doll} = 3 \times \text{Cost of one action figure} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of toy:
- 5 red cars: $4 \times 5 = 20
- 3 action figures: $5 \times 3 = 15
- 1 doll: $15

The total worth of all the toys is the sum of the costs of each type of toy:
\[ \text{Total worth} = 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the difference in cost between doing taxes herself and hiring an accountant, we need to consider the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

Let's calculate the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself:
Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour
= 3 × 35
= $105

Now, let's compare this to the cost of hiring the accountant:
Cost of hiring the accountant = $90

The difference in cost between doing taxes herself and hiring an accountant is the income lost minus the cost of hiring the accountant:
Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories and subtract it from her budget.

The total cost of the computer accessories is the sum of the individual costs:

Computer: €1090
Scanner: €157
CD burner: €74
Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1323

Now, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:

€1500 - €1323 = €177

Therefore, Elvira will have €177 left for her clothing."
"To determine the number of times Sandra must babysit to obtain the required eggs, we need to calculate the total number of eggs needed for the Spanish flans and then divide that by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job.

The total number of eggs required for 15 Spanish flans is 3 eggs per flan multiplied by 15 flans, which is 3 × 15 = 45 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job: 45 eggs / 9 eggs per babysitting job = 5.

Therefore, Sandra must babysit 5 times to obtain the required eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's analyze the problem. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, which can be expressed as:

S = 2B

where S represents Seth's current age and B represents Brooke's current age.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be expressed as:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Given that Ethel has $8, we can calculate Jimmy's amount by first determining twice the amount Ethel has. This is a straightforward arithmetic operation, where we multiply the given value by 2:

2 × 8 = 16

Now, we are told that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. To find Jimmy's total, we add 2 to the result of the previous calculation:

16 + 2 = 18

Therefore, Jimmy has $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles walked during the weekdays and weekends separately.

Let's denote the number of miles Pancho walks on a weekday as \(W_{weekday} = 20\) miles and the number of miles he walks on a weekend day as \(W_{weekend} = 10\) miles.

Since there are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week, we can calculate the total miles walked during the weekdays as \(5 \times W_{weekday} = 5 \times 20 = 100\) miles.

Similarly, the total miles walked during the weekend days is \(2 \times W_{weekend} = 2 \times 10 = 20\) miles.

Now, we can find the total miles walked in a week by adding the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend days: \(Total\ miles = 100 + 20 = 120\) miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is given as $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat, so it is 3 × $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The final answer is: $150"
"To calculate the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to apply the concept of arithmetic addition to the individual counts of legs for each group of creatures.

"Given the problem, we can establish the relationships between the ages of the four birds as follows:

Let's denote the age of Sally Two as S2, the age of Granny Red as GR, and the age of Sally Four as S4. We are given that Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. Therefore, S4 = 8.

We are also given that Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so GR = 2 * S4 = 2 * 8 = 16.

Furthermore, we know that Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so S2 = GR + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19.

Now, to find the total age of the four birds, we can simply add their ages together: S2 + GR + S4 + S32 = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51.

The increased minimum payment for each debt is calculated by multiplying the minimum payment by 1.5. 

- Student loans: $300 × 1.5 = $450
- Credit card: $200 × 1.5 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 × 1.5 = $750

Now, we sum the increased minimum payments:
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

To find the total annual payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
$1500 × 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To determine the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Let's denote the time to peel one potato as $P$ and the time to cut one potato as $C$. We are given that $P = 1.5$ minutes and $C = \frac{5}{60}$ minutes.

The total time to peel all potatoes is $60P = 60 \cdot 1.5 = 90$ minutes.

The total time to cut all potatoes is $60C = 60 \cdot \frac{5}{60} = 5$ minutes.

The total time to peel and cut all potatoes is the sum of these two times: $90 + 5 = 95$ minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{95}$"
"To determine the cost of lemons, we need to first calculate the total revenue and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's denote the number of gallons as 'g'. The total revenue is the number of gallons multiplied by the revenue per gallon, which is $10. The total revenue is given by:

Total Revenue = g \* $10

We are given that the profit is $25, so the total revenue is the sum of the profit and the cost. The cost consists of the cost of lemons and the cost of sugar. The cost of sugar per gallon is $2, and the cost of lemons per gallon is $3. Therefore, the total cost per gallon is $5.

The total cost is given by:

Total Cost = g \* $5

Since the profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, we can set up the equation:

g \* $10 - g \* $5 = $25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

5g = $25

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

g = $5

Now that we have the number of gallons, we can find the cost of lemons. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3, so the total cost of lemons is:

Total Cost of Lemons = g \* $3
= $5 \* $3
= $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to calculate the total number of Chinese participants. Given that there are 240 participants in total and 80 of them are Japanese, we can find the number of Chinese participants by subtracting the number of Japanese participants from the total.

Let's denote the number of Chinese participants as C. We can express this as:

C = Total participants - Japanese participants
C = 240 - 80
C = 160

Now that we know there are 160 Chinese participants, and we are given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = C - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the amount of money Zaid has left after all expenses and donations, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, let's calculate the amount spent on rent: $\frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 600$.

Next, we calculate the amount spent on car fuel: $\frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000$.

Now, we find the remaining amount after rent and car fuel: $6000 - 600 - 2000 = 3400$.

Then, we calculate the amount donated to charity: $\frac{1}{2} \times 3400 = 1700$.

After the donation, the remaining amount is: $3400 - 1700 = 1700$.

Next, we calculate the total amount given to his daughter and wife: $200 + 700 = 900$.

Finally, we find the final remaining amount: $1700 - 900 = 800$.

The final answer is: $800"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a linear relationship between the number of crabs each person has. Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as B, Monic has as M, and Rani has as R.

We are given that Bo has 40 crabs, so B = 40. We also know that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, which can be expressed as M = B - 4. Substituting the value of B, we get M = 40 - 4 = 36.

Furthermore, Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so R = M + 10. Substituting the value of M, we get R = 36 + 10 = 46.

To find the total number of crabs, we add the number of crabs each person has: B + M + R = 40 + 36 + 46.

The total number of crabs is 40 + 36 + 46 = 122.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"To determine Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then sum them.

Let's denote Lloyd's hourly wage as $10 and the number of hours tutored in the first week as 5, and the number of hours tutored in the second week as 8.

Earnings for the first week = 5 hours * $10/hour = $50

Earnings for the second week = 8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Total earnings for the first two weeks = Earnings for the first week + Earnings for the second week
= $50 + $80
= $130

The final answer is: $130"
"Given that the winner of the class representative election received 3/4 of the total votes, we can calculate the number of votes the winner obtained as follows:

Let's denote the total number of students who voted as T. We are given that T = 80.

The number of votes the winner received is 3/4 of the total votes, which can be expressed as:

Winner's votes = (3/4) * T
Winner's votes = (3/4) * 80
Winner's votes = 60

Now, to find the number of votes the loser received, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes:

Loser's votes = T - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60
Loser's votes = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the number of red roses that Fred must deliver to keep Sandra's business, we need to establish the relationship between the number of white carnations and the number of red roses. We are given that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x, and we know that 5x = 200. 

To find 'x', we can solve the equation 5x = 200 for x by dividing both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{200}{5} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We are given that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of red roses as 'y'. Then, y = 4x, and we know that x = 40. 
\[ y = 4 \times 40 \]
\[ y = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"Given the problem, let's apply algebraic reasoning to solve for Jean's age.

Let's denote Mark's current age as M and Jan's current age as J. We are given that J = 30.

From the first statement, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is M + 2.

The second statement tells us that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. We can express this as an equation:

M - 2 = (1/2)(J - 2) + 5

Substituting J = 30 into the equation, we get:

M - 2 = (1/2)(30 - 2) + 5
M - 2 = (1/2)(28) + 5
M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19

Now, we can solve for M by adding 2 to both sides of the equation:

M = 19 + 2
M = 21

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:

Jean's age = M + 2
Jean's age = 21 + 2
Jean's age = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"Given the scenario, we have two teams competing in a 4x400 meter relay. The well-rounded team has each member completing their 400 meter leg in 55 seconds. The less well-rounded team's first runner completes their leg in 60 seconds, with each subsequent runner being 3 seconds faster than the previous one.

To find the total time for each team, we can calculate the sum of their individual times. For the well-rounded team, this is straightforward: 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

For the less well-rounded team, we can use a simple arithmetic sequence to find the total time. The sequence of times for their runners is 60, 57, 54, and 51 seconds. The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:

S = n/2 * (a1 + an)

where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. In this case, n = 4, a1 = 60, and an = 51.

S = 4/2 * (60 + 51)
S = 2 * 111
S = 222

However, this is the sum of the sequence, but we need to find the total time for the less well-rounded team. Since the sequence represents the time for each runner, we need to find the sum of the sequence, which we've already calculated as 222 seconds. However, this is the sum of the sequence, not the total time for the team. To find the total time, we need to add the time for the first runner, which is 60 seconds. 

The total time for the less well-rounded team is 222 + 60 = 282 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 282 = -62 seconds. However, since time cannot be negative, we need to find the absolute difference. The faster team will win by | -62 | = 62 seconds.

The faster team will win by 62 seconds."
"To determine the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, we consider the favorable outcomes and the total number of outcomes. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) and 6 total outcomes. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is therefore $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$, or 50%.

Next, we calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a six-sided die. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$. Since the two events are independent, we multiply the probabilities: $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4}$, or 25%.

To find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: $50\% - 25\% = 25\%$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Given that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, and her mother picked 20 apples, we can determine the number of apples Jenna picked by dividing the number of apples her mother picked by 2.

Let's denote the number of apples Jenna picked as J and the number of apples her mother picked as M. We know that J = M/2. Since M = 20, we can substitute this value into the equation to find J:

J = 20/2
J = 10

Now that we know Jenna picked 10 apples, we can find the total number of apples they both picked by adding the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mother picked:

Total apples = J + M
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"Given that the rats are distributed in equal groups across 3 cages, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. The total number of rats in 3 cages is then 3r.

We are also given that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each hamster receiving 5 pieces of straw, and a pen of rabbits receiving 20 pieces of straw. The total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50, and the total number of straw pieces given to the rabbits is 20.

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160. Since the hamsters and rabbits receive 70 pieces of straw in total, the remaining straw pieces are given to the rats. Therefore, the number of straw pieces given to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15. Since the rats are distributed in 3 cages, the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r = 15. Solving for 'r', we get r = 5.

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to apply the formula for compound interest, which is A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the total amount, P is the principal amount, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of months.

Given that the principal amount P is $100, the monthly interest rate r is 2% or 0.02, and the number of months n is 3, we can plug these values into the formula:

A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3
A = 100(1.02)^3
A = 100(1.061208)
A = 106.1208

Therefore, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:
x = \frac{400}{8}

x = 50

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total cost and the amount each friend paid, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25. 

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the tickets, so it's $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

The total cost is $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since they split the cost evenly, each friend paid $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is $34."
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the product of the peaches collected per minute and the total minutes spent collecting.

Given that John collects 2 peaches per minute, we can express this as a rate of 2 peaches/minute. The time spent collecting peaches is 3 hours, which is equivalent to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total number of peaches collected by multiplying the rate by the time:

2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches

Therefore, the total number of peaches John collects is 360.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the daily insect consumption of a flock of ten ducks, we first need to calculate their weekly consumption. Given that each duck requires 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we can find the total weekly consumption by multiplying the individual consumption by the number of ducks.

Weekly consumption = 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the daily consumption by dividing the total weekly consumption by 7.

Daily consumption = 35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds/day

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks requires 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over this period.

Let's denote the number of trees Tom plants per year as P = 10 and the number of trees he chops down per year as C = 2. The net change in trees per year is given by the difference between the number of trees planted and the number of trees chopped down, which is P - C = 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change in the number of trees is the product of the net change per year and the number of years, which is (P - C) * 10 = 8 * 10 = 80.

Tom starts with 50 trees, so after 10 years, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply the total number of trees by the percentage that die, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39.

Therefore, the number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final numerical answer is: 91"
"To determine the difference between the number of pink and white plastic flamingos, let's break down the events step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 18 = 6$ flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and $18 - 6 = 12$ pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now $12 + 18 = 30$.

The total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: $30 - 6 = 24$.

"To determine the change Violetta will receive after purchasing the crayons, we need to calculate the total cost of the crayons and subtract it from the amount of money she has.

First, let's find the total cost of the crayons. Since Violetta needs 5 different colors and each color will have 2 crayons, the total number of crayons she needs is 5 * 2 = 10.

The cost of one crayon is $2. Therefore, the total cost of the crayons is 10 * $2 = $20.

Now, let's calculate the change Violetta will receive. The amount of money she has is $20, and the total cost of the crayons is also $20. 

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

"Given that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, we can establish the cost of a pen by adding the cost of a pencil and an eraser.

Let's denote the cost of a pencil as $1.20 and the cost of an eraser as $0.30. Therefore, the cost of a pen is the sum of these two values.

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we need to calculate the cost of 8 pens. To do this, we multiply the cost of a single pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8 = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine the amount of carrots that will not be used, we need to calculate the total pounds of carrots distributed to the restaurants and subtract that from the initial amount.

Given that each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots and there are 40 restaurants, we can calculate the total pounds of carrots distributed as follows:

Total pounds of carrots distributed = 2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants
= 2 * 40
= 2 * 40
= 2 × 40
= 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds distributed from the initial amount:

Initial amount = 200 pounds
Total pounds distributed = 80 pounds
Pounds not used = Initial amount - Total pounds distributed
= 200 - 80
= 200 - 80
= 200 - 80
= 200 - 80
= 120 pounds

Therefore, the amount of carrots that will not be used is 120 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"

Let's denote the total population as P, the number of men as M, the number of women as W, and the number of children as C. We are given that P = 23786, M = 8417, and W = 9092.

We can express the relationship between these variables as:

C = P - (M + W)

Substituting the given values, we get:

C = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
C = 23786 - 17509
C = 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277.

"To determine the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them to the initial number.

Let's denote the initial number of cards as $n$. Elaine initially had $n = 20$ Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number: $3n = 3 \cdot 20 = 60$ cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month: $60 - 20 = 40$ cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: $2(60 + 40) = 2 \cdot 100 = 200$ cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month and the initial number: $n + 60 + 40 + 200 = 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{320}$"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Given that Mark edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, we can infer that he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount he makes from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, the rate per sentence for Publisher B is 2 * 5 = 10 cents. Therefore, the total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amounts from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7500}$"
"To determine the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he receives and then multiply it by the volume of water in each pail.

Baldur receives 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. Therefore, the total number of pails he receives in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he receives every day is given by the product of the total number of pails and the volume of water in each pail:

Total water = (5 pails/day + 6 pails/day) × 5 liters/pail
Total water = 11 pails/day × 5 liters/pail
Total water = 55 liters/day

"To determine the total amount John made that year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then multiply it by the number of weeks he worked.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise. The formula for calculating a percentage increase is:

Increase = (Percentage / 100) * Original Value

In this case, the percentage increase is 5% and the original value is $2000. Plugging in the values, we get:

Increase = (5 / 100) * 2000
= 0.05 * 2000
= $100

Now, we add the increase to the original salary to get the new salary:

New Salary = Original Salary + Increase
= 2000 + 100
= $2100

Since John works every week of the year, we need to multiply the new salary by the number of weeks in a year, which is 52.

Total Amount Made = New Salary * Number of Weeks
= 2100 * 52
= $109,200

Therefore, the total amount John made that year is $109,200."
"To determine the total number of barrels of wine produced per year on Josie's 10-acre farm, we need to apply the principles of multiplication to find the total tons of grapes produced and then multiply it by the number of barrels per ton.

First, we calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year by multiplying the number of acres by the tons of grapes per acre:

10 acres × 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we apply the concept of scalar multiplication to find the total number of barrels of wine produced per year by multiplying the total tons of grapes by the number of barrels per ton:

50 tons × 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, Josie's 10-acre farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish separately and then add them together.

Let's start by calculating the slices used for sandwiches. Since Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days and used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich, we can use the formula:

Total slices for sandwiches = Number of days × Slices per sandwich
= 7 × 2
= 14

Next, we'll calculate the slices used for omelets. Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. Therefore, the total slices for omelets can be calculated as:

Total slices for omelets = Number of days × Slices per omelet
= 3 × 3
= 9

Now, let's consider the slices used for the macaroni and cheese dish. Carl used 8 slices of cheese in it.

To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we add the slices used for each meal together:

Total slices = Total slices for sandwiches + Total slices for omelets + Slices used for macaroni and cheese
= 14 + 9 + 8
= 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To determine the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of blue and red pens she purchased and add them to her initial number of pens.

Let's denote the number of green pens as G, the number of yellow pens as Y, the number of blue pens as B, and the number of red pens as R. We are given that G = 22, Y = 10, B = 6 * 9 = 54, and R = 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of new pens purchased is B + R = 54 + 12 = 66.

The total number of pens Janet initially had is G + Y = 22 + 10 = 32.

Now, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens she purchased: 32 + 66 = 98.

Therefore, Janet now has a total of 98 pens.

The final answer is: 98"
"To determine the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to calculate the total score required for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we can use the formula for the average:

Average = (Sum of all scores) / Number of tests

We can rearrange this formula to solve for the sum of all scores:

Sum of all scores = Average * Number of tests
Sum of all scores = 93 * 6
Sum of all scores = 558

Next, we need to find the total score of the first five tests. We add up the scores of the first five tests:

89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score of the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score of the remaining four tests, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests:

338 - 71 = 267

Now, we can find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test by subtracting the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score required for the semester:

Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 267
Score needed on the sixth test = 291

The final answer is: $\boxed{291}$"
"To determine the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers for each period and add them together.

First, let's calculate the total kilometers for the first four weeks. We can use the formula for the total distance traveled, which is the product of the distance per ride, the number of rides per week, and the number of weeks:

Total distance = distance per ride * rides per week * weeks
Total distance = 25 km/ride * 5 rides/week * 4 weeks
Total distance = 25 * 5 * 4
Total distance = 500 km

Next, let's calculate the total kilometers for the next three weeks:
Total distance = 60 km/ride * 2 rides/week * 3 weeks
Total distance = 60 * 2 * 3
Total distance = 360 km

Now, let's add the total kilometers for both periods:
Total distance = 500 km + 360 km
Total distance = 860 km

The final answer is: 860"
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we must first calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately, then sum them.

The weight of the chocolate bars can be found by multiplying the number of chocolate bars by the weight of each bar: 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can express the weight of each candied apple as x. Therefore, the weight of each chocolate bar is 2x. Given that the weight of each chocolate bar is 40g, we can set up the equation 2x = 40g and solve for x to find the weight of each candied apple.

2x = 40g
x = 40g / 2
x = 20g

Now that we know the weight of each candied apple, we can calculate the total weight of the candied apples by multiplying the number of candied apples by the weight of each apple: 80 * 20g = 1600g.

The total weight of the bag of candy is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she purchased each day and sum them together.

Let's denote the number of cakes she bought on Monday as M, which is given as 4. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which can be expressed as 3M. Substituting the value of M, we get 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which can be expressed as 5(3M). Substituting the value of 3M, we get 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: M + 3M + 5(3M) = 4 + 12 + 60.

Combining like terms, we get 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

The final answer is: $\boxed{76}$"
"To calculate the total cost of buying each cup, we need to determine the cost of twenty dozen cups and then divide it by the number of cups.

First, let's find the cost of half a dozen plates, which is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $\frac{34,800}{240}$.

Simplifying the expression, we get $\frac{34,800}{240} = 145$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{145}$"
"To determine the number of times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to earn and subtract the amount she already has.

Let's denote the number of times Sara must mow the lawn as x. The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 + 2 * $20 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

The total amount she earns from babysitting is $5 * 4 = $20. The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is $70 - $10 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can set up the equation 4x = 40 to represent the situation.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 40 / 4.

x = 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Let's analyze the problem. We have a system of linear equations where the number of red chickens (R) and white chickens (W) are related by the equation W = R + 2. The total number of eggs collected is 42, with red chickens producing 3 eggs each and white chickens producing 5 eggs each. This gives us the equation 3R + 5W = 42.

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

Therefore, the number of red chickens is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the time Gary spends walking around the edge of the local park, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(l + w)
P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a constant speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, the time Gary spends walking is 5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x.

We know that the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, so it can be represented as x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day is given as 500. Since the number of customers on the third day is the sum of the customers on the first two days, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:

2x + 50 = 500

Subtract 50 from both sides:

2x = 450

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 225

However, x represents the number of customers on the first day, not the third day. To find the number of customers on the third day, we need to add 50 to x:

Customers on the third day = x + 50
= 225 + 50
= 275

The final answer is: 275"
"Let's analyze the problem. We have two pools, both leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute. We'll denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Consequently, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons, as it's stated that the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago.

Since 4 minutes have elapsed, the total amount of water leaked from both pools is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons. Therefore, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16 gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16 gallons.

We're given that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. This can be expressed as the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

So, the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. The amount of water in the small pool now is 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of hours Lori needs to work, we must first calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the belt.

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Next, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to purchase the shoes and the belt.

The final answer is: 44"
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay in monthly installments and then subtract that from the initial amount borrowed plus the additional 10% interest.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months:

$$\text{Total Amount Paid} = \text{Monthly Payment} \times \text{Number of Months}$$

$$\text{Total Amount Paid} = \$165 \times 12$$

$$\text{Total Amount Paid} = \$1980$$

Next, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay including the additional 10% interest:

$$\text{Total Amount to be Paid} = \text{Initial Amount Borrowed} + (\text{Initial Amount Borrowed} \times 0.10)$$

$$\text{Total Amount to be Paid} = \$2000 + (\$2000 \times 0.10)$$

$$\text{Total Amount to be Paid} = \$2000 + \$200$$

$$\text{Total Amount to be Paid} = \$2200$$

Now, let's calculate the remaining balance:

$$\text{Remaining Balance} = \text{Total Amount to be Paid} - \text{Total Amount Paid}$$

$$\text{Remaining Balance} = \$2200 - \$1980$$

$$\text{Remaining Balance} = \$220$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{220}$"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses.

Given that there are 4 roses in the vase, and there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can express the number of dahlias as 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias: 4 + 11 = 15.

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"Given that Harriet's current age is 21 years, we can deduce the ages of the other two individuals using the provided relationships.

Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can express Zack's age as 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Similarly, Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so we can express Adrian's age as 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, we need to calculate their ages in three years. To do this, we add 3 to each of their current ages:
- Harriet's age in three years: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack's age in three years: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian's age in three years: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

The final numerical answer is: 45"
"To determine the number of points Jojo scored, we can start by calculating the total points scored by the other three students. 

Let's denote the points scored by Naomi as N, Yuri as Y, Brianna as B, and Jojo as J. We are given that N = 68. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi, so Y = 0.5N + 10. Substituting the value of N, we get Y = 0.5(68) + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so B = N + 17 = 68 + 17 = 85.

The total points scored by the three students (Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna) is N + Y + B = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find the points scored by Jojo by subtracting the total points scored by the other three students from the total points scored by all four students: J = 251 - 197 = 54.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the total time spent on these puzzles, we can calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles separately and then add them together.

The time spent on crossword puzzles is given by the product of the number of puzzles and the time per puzzle: 3 puzzles * 10 minutes/puzzle = 3 × 10 = 30 minutes.

Similarly, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is given by the product of the number of puzzles and the time per puzzle: 8 puzzles * 5 minutes/puzzle = 8 × 5 = 40 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles: 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach. 

First, we determine the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. This can be calculated as follows:

Initial water in the tank = 120 liters
Water used by Celine = 90 liters
Remaining water = Initial water - Water used
Remaining water = 120 - 90
Remaining water = 30 liters

Next, we calculate the amount of rainwater collected, which is twice the amount of water left in the tank.

Rainwater collected = 2 * Remaining water
Rainwater collected = 2 * 30
Rainwater collected = 60 liters

Now, we find the total amount of water in the tank by adding the remaining water and the collected rainwater.

Total water in the tank = Remaining water + Rainwater collected
Total water in the tank = 30 + 60
Total water in the tank = 90 liters

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers, we need to calculate the number of petunias first. Since Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we can express this as an equation: petunias = geraniums - 40. Given that the number of geraniums is 90, we can substitute this value into the equation: petunias = 90 - 40 = 50.

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias: total flowers = geraniums + petunias = 90 + 50 = 140.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year. 

The company initially spends $15000 on advertising for the first year. To find the amount spent in the second year, we calculate a third of the initial amount: 

$$\frac{1}{3} \times 15000 = \frac{15000}{3} = 5000$$

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year to find the total:

$$15000 + 5000 = 20000$$

Therefore, the total amount spent on advertising for the two years is $20000.

"To determine the total cost of the rentals, we need to calculate the cost for Carlos and Benji separately and then add them together.

Let's start by calculating the cost for Carlos, who rents a canoe for $30 an hour and uses it for 3 hours. This can be represented as:

Cost for Carlos = 30 * 3
Cost for Carlos = $90

Next, we'll calculate the cost for Benji, who rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour and uses it for 5 hours. This can be represented as:

Cost for Benji = 18 * 5
Cost for Benji = $90

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost for Carlos and Benji together:

Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
Total cost = $90 + $90
Total cost = $180

The final answer is: $180"
"To determine the total duration of Andrew's trip, we need to consider the time it takes to travel to Rochester by bus and the time it takes to return by car.

The time it takes to travel by bus is given as 6 days. 

Since it takes half as many days to travel by car, we can express this as a mathematical relationship: 

t_car = (1/2) * t_bus

where t_car is the time it takes to travel by car and t_bus is the time it takes to travel by bus. 

Given t_bus = 6 days, we can substitute this value into the equation:

t_car = (1/2) * 6
t_car = 3 days

Now, we can calculate the total time for the round trip by adding the time it takes to travel to Rochester by bus and the time it takes to return by car:

t_total = t_bus + t_car
t_total = 6 + 3
t_total = 9 days

Therefore, the total duration of Andrew's trip is 9 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the probability of selecting a water type card from James' collection, we need to calculate the proportion of water type cards to the total number of cards.

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards, the number of water type cards is reduced to 40 - 8 = 32. The total number of cards is now 90 - 8 = 82.

Subsequently, James buys 14 grass type cards, increasing the total number of cards to 82 + 14 = 96, and the number of grass type cards to 20 + 14 = 34.

Now, we can calculate the probability of selecting a water type card:

Probability = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) × 100
= (32 / 96) × 100
= (1/3) × 100
= 33.333...

Rounded to the nearest integer, the probability is 33%.

"To determine the amount Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, so 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
The total cost of the extra items is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To determine the time it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of puzzle piece placement.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, while her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, which is 2 pieces per minute. Their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates, so it is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Now, we can use the formula: time = total number of pieces / combined rate. Plugging in the values, we get:

time = 360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6. This gives us:

time = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

time = 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two months. Given that 30% of the initial 120 watermelons are ready, we can express this as a decimal and multiply it by the total number of watermelons:

$$
\text{Watermelons ready after 2 months} = 0.30 \times 120 = 36
$$

Next, we find the number of watermelons remaining after two months by subtracting the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the initial total:

$$
\text{Watermelons remaining after 2 months} = 120 - 36 = 84
$$

Now, we calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks. Since 3/4 of the remaining melons are ready, we can express this as a decimal and multiply it by the number of remaining watermelons:

$$
\text{Watermelons ready after 2 weeks} = 0.75 \times 84 = 63
$$

Finally, we determine the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks by subtracting the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the number of watermelons remaining after two months:

$$
\text{Watermelons not ready after 2 weeks} = 84 - 63 = 21

"To determine the total cost of the fleet of cars, we need to consider the initial purchase price, the tax on the cars, and the registration fee.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000.

Next, we'll calculate the tax on the cars. Since Mark pays 10% tax, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 10 by 100: 10/100 = 0.1. Then, we multiply the total cost of the cars by this decimal to find the tax: $240,000 * 0.1 = $24,000.

Now, we'll calculate the registration fee: 12 cars * $1000 per car = $12,000.

To find the total cost, we add the initial purchase price, the tax, and the registration fee: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"

Kylie's shells on Monday = Robert's shells on Monday + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 20 + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 25

Now, we need to find the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, which is 2 times the number of shells she collected on Monday. This can be expressed as:

Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 × Kylie's shells on Monday
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 × 25
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 50

"To determine the number of penguins still left sunbathing, we need to calculate the number of penguins that jumped in the ocean and went inside the cave. 

One-third of the total number of penguins is given by the expression $\frac{1}{3} \times 36$. This can be simplified to $\frac{36}{3} = 12$. Therefore, 12 penguins jumped in the ocean and 12 penguins went inside the cave.

The total number of penguins that left the sunbathing area is $12 + 12 = 24$.

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: $36 - 24 = 12$.

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is 12.

"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we must first calculate the total number of tomatoes consumed by Steve and his girlfriend per week. 

Let's denote the number of tomatoes Steve eats per day as S. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve, which is S/2. We are given that Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so S = 6. 

The number of tomatoes Steve eats per week is 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week. His girlfriend eats 6/2 = 3 tomatoes/day, so she eats 3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week.

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can find the number of vines needed by dividing the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine: 63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we must first calculate the total number of slices required to ensure each of the 20 friends receives 4 slices. This can be done by multiplying the number of friends by the number of slices per friend.

Total number of friends: 20
Number of slices per friend: 4
Total number of slices required: 20 × 4 = 80

Since pizzas are sold in slices of 8, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza to find the minimum number of pizzas needed.

Number of slices per pizza: 8
Number of pizzas required: 80 ÷ 8 = 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends receives 4 slices."
"Let's analyze the problem. Ram buys 25 pens and uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low. We can model this as a geometric series, where the first term (a) is 25 (the initial number of pens) and the common ratio (r) is 1/5, since he can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens.

The total number of pens Ram gets is the sum of the initial pens and the pens he makes from the ink of the previous pens. This can be represented as:

Total pens = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ...

where a = 25 and r = 1/5.

We can use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series to find the total number of pens:

S = a / (1 - r)

Substituting the values, we get:

S = 25 / (1 - 1/5)
= 25 / (4/5)
= 25 * (5/4)
= 31.25

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a pen, we round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we are not asked to round, so we will leave the answer as is.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31.25}$"
"To determine the amount of money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow a straightforward mathematical process.

First, we calculate the initial sum of money Johnny had after adding the extra $10 to his allowance of $20. This can be expressed as:

Initial Sum = $20 + $10
Initial Sum = $30

Next, we know that this sum tripled in a year. To find the final amount, we multiply the initial sum by 3:

Final Amount = 3 × Initial Sum
Final Amount = 3 × $30
Final Amount = $90

Therefore, the correct answer is $90."
"Given the problem, we can establish a linear relationship between the ages of the three girls. Let's denote Jessa's age as J, Joan's age as J + 5, and Mary's age as (J + 5) - 2.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, we can substitute J = 20 into the expressions for Joan's and Mary's ages.

Joan's age = J + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
Mary's age = (J + 5) - 2 = (20 + 5) - 2 = 23

Now, we can find the sum of their ages by adding their individual ages: J + (J + 5) + ((J + 5) - 2) = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To determine the number of students who exited through exit C, we'll break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 1000 students in the hall.

First, 30% of the students exited through exit A:
\[ 30\% \times 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]
The number of students remaining is:
\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students exited through exit B:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]
The number of students remaining is:
\[ 700 - 420 = 280 \]

Therefore, the number of students who exited through exit C is 280.

"Given the scenario, we can establish a relationship between the number of candies each person has. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as R. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can express this as:

J = 2R

We are also given that John has 54 candies, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

54 = 2R

To find the value of R, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

R = 54 / 2
R = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find the number of candies James has by adding 6 to R:

J = R + 6
J = 27 + 6
J = 33

To determine how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

Difference = J - R
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"Let's analyze the problem. We have two individuals, Dolly and Pandora, each with a set of books. Dolly has 2 books, and Pandora has 1 book. To find the total number of books read, we need to consider the books each person reads.

Dolly reads her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, resulting in a total of 2 + 1 = 3 books read by Dolly.

Pandora reads her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, resulting in a total of 1 + 2 = 3 books read by Pandora.

To find the total number of books read, we add the number of books read by Dolly and Pandora: 3 (by Dolly) + 3 (by Pandora) = 6.

Therefore, the total number of books read is 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the time Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

Let's start by finding the total number of letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Mike to write these pages. Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 6 hours writing a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes used for his daily calls and the extra minutes, then subtract that from his total minutes.

First, let's calculate the total minutes used for his daily calls. Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day and there are 30 days in the month, we can use the formula:

Total daily minutes = 15 minutes/day * 30 days
Total daily minutes = 15 * 30
Total daily minutes = 450 minutes

Next, we need to add the extra minutes Jason used this month. 

Extra minutes = 300 minutes

Now, we can find the total minutes used by adding the daily minutes and the extra minutes:

Total minutes used = Total daily minutes + Extra minutes
Total minutes used = 450 minutes + 300 minutes
Total minutes used = 750 minutes

Finally, we can find the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan by subtracting the total minutes used from the total minutes in the plan:

Remaining minutes = Total minutes - Total minutes used
Remaining minutes = 1000 minutes - 750 minutes
Remaining minutes = 250 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach to isolate the variable representing the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. Initially, Griffin had 24 fries. After Kyle took 5 fries, Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Since Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, and Kyle took 5 fries, Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Therefore, after Billy took his share, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Next, Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took his share, Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Given two aquariums with an equal number of fish, let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. The total number of fish in both aquariums is therefore 2x.

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28. According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

28 = 4x

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 4:

x = 28/4

x = 7

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total cost of the makeup services, we need to calculate the cost per day, then multiply it by the number of days worked per week, and finally multiply it by the number of weeks.

Let's denote the hourly rate as $250, the number of hours worked per day as 6, the number of days worked per week as 4, and the number of weeks as 5.

Cost per day = 6 hours/day × $250/hour = $1500/day

Cost per week = $1500/day × 4 days/week = $6000/week

Total cost before discount = $6000/week × 5 weeks = $30,000

To calculate the discount, we need to find 10% of the total cost before discount.

Discount = 0.1 × $30,000 = $3000

Now, we can find the total amount Jean paid by subtracting the discount from the total cost before discount.

Total amount paid = $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To determine the amount each person paid for the party supplies, we need to calculate the total cost of the party and then divide it by the number of people splitting the cost.

The total cost of the party supplies is calculated as follows:

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle and her two parents are splitting the cost evenly, there are 3 people in total. To find the amount each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$\frac{96}{3} = 32$

Therefore, each person paid $32."
"To determine the total cost of the onions, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

Given that the chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds, we can calculate the total weight as follows:

Total weight = Number of bags * Weight per bag
Total weight = 4 * 50
Total weight = 200 pounds

The cost per pound of onions is $1.50. To find the total cost, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound:

Total cost = Total weight * Cost per pound
Total cost = 200 * $1.50
Total cost = $300

Therefore, the total cost of the onions is $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister, we need to calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate and then multiply it by the calories per cookie.

Let's denote the number of cookies eaten by Sue's sister on Monday as x. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, the number of cookies eaten by Sue on Monday is 4x. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so the number of cookies eaten by Sue on Tuesday is 2(13) = 26. Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday.

The total number of cookies eaten by Sue is 4x + 26, and the total number of cookies eaten by her sister is x + 13.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by Sue is (4x + 26) * 200, and the total calories consumed by her sister is (x + 13) * 200.

We are given that her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, so x = 5. Therefore, the total calories consumed by Sue is (4 * 5 + 26) * 200 = 20 * 200 + 26 * 200 = 4000 + 5200 = 9200, and the total calories consumed by her sister is (5 + 13) * 200 = 18 * 200 = 3600.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5600}$"
"Given that each class in the school has 20 students and there are 3 classes, we can start by finding the total number of students in the school, which is 20 * 3 = 60.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We are given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

The number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 30.

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33.

To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to subtract the total number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 30 - 33 = -3.

However, this result is not feasible since we cannot have a negative number of students. This indicates that the given information is inconsistent.

But, if we assume that the given information is correct, then the number of boys in the third class is -3.

However, since we cannot have a negative number of students, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem by finding the number of boys in the first two classes. We know that the total number of students in the first two classes is 20 + 20 = 40. Since the school is 50% girls, the number of girls in the first two classes is 0.5 * 40 = 20.

We are given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

However, we know that the number of girls in the first two classes is 20. This means that the given information is inconsistent.

However, if we assume that the given information is correct, then the number of boys in the first two classes is 40 - 27 = 13.

The number of boys in the third class is 30 - 13 = 17.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the current number of apps on Travis's tablet, we need to apply the principles of arithmetic operations. Specifically, we will use the concept of addition and subtraction to find the final count.

First, we start with the initial number of apps, which is 61. Then, we subtract the number of apps Travis deleted, which is 9. This operation is represented as:

61 - 9 = 52

Next, we add the number of apps Travis downloaded, which is 18. This operation is represented as:

52 + 18 = 70

Therefore, the current number of apps on Travis's tablet is 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of wolves and cougars he killed last night and today.

Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed today as x. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, the number of cougars he killed last night is x + 3.

We know that the number of cougars he killed today is 12, so we can set up the equation x = 12.

Now, we can find the number of cougars he killed last night by substituting x into the equation: x + 3 = 12 + 3 = 15.

Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x = 3(12) = 36.

The total number of wolves killed is the sum of the wolves killed last night and today: 10 + 36 = 46.

The total number of cougars killed is the sum of the cougars killed last night and today: 15 + 12 = 27.

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of the wolves and cougars: 46 + 27 = 73.

The final answer is: $\boxed{73}$"
"To determine the floor Bill is on, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor (3) plus 6.

4 \* 3 = 12
12 + 6 = 18

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To determine the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we need to calculate the number of times Anne went down the slide first. 

Let's denote the number of times Mitchel went down the slide as M, which is given as 30. We are also given that Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find 30% of 30, we can express it as 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

Now, we subtract this value from the number of times Mitchel went down the slide to find the number of times Anne went down the slide: M - 0.3M = 0.7M. Substituting the value of M, we get 0.7 * 30 = 21.

Since Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, we can express this as 4 * A, where A is the number of times Anne went down the slide. Substituting the value of A, we get 4 * 21 = 84.

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, we have 10 stalls with 20 cows each. This gives us a total of 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and distributes them equally among the 10 stalls. To find out how many cows each stall gets, we divide the total number of new cows by the number of stalls:

40 cows / 10 stalls = 4 cows per stall

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. To do this, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:

24 cows/stall * 8 stalls = 192 cows

Therefore, there are 192 cows in 8 of the stalls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{192}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the coins:

- 100 pennies = 100 \* $0.01 = $1.00
- 40 nickels = 40 \* $0.05 = $2.00
- 20 dimes = 20 \* $0.10 = $2.00

Next, we'll calculate the value of the dollar bills:

- 40 dollar bills = 40 \* $1.00 = $40.00

Now, let's add the values together:

$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Brady has a total of $45.00 in his piggy bank.

The final answer is: $45"
"To determine the total weight of the redwood, we first need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. Given that the redwood is 200 feet tall, we can find the number of sections by dividing the total height by the length of each section: 

$$\frac{200}{10} = 20$$

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by multiplying the number of sections by the weight of each section:

$$20 \times 400 = 8000$$

However, termites have consumed 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight. To calculate 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3:

$$0.3 \times 8000 = 2400$$

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000 to find the final weight:

$$8000 - 2400 = 5600$$

The final weight of the redwood is 5600 pounds."
"To determine the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is given by the product of the number of books and the cost per book: 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

The flat fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue is $2.00.

Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is the sum of the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"Let's analyze the given information:

Let A be the number of apples Andrea has, J be the number of apples Jamal has, and B be the number of bananas Jamal has.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. A = J + 8 (Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal)
2. A = 52 (Andrea has 52 apples)
3. B = J + 4 (Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples)
4. A/2 = B (Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal)

Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:
52 = J + 8
J = 44

Now, we can find the number of bananas Jamal has:
B = J + 4
B = 44 + 4
B = 48

Since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
A/2 = B
52/2 = 48
This is consistent with our previous result.

Now, let's find the total number of fruits:
Total = A + J + B + B (since Andrea has the same number of bananas as Jamal)
Total = 52 + 44 + 48 + 48
Total = 192

The final answer is: 192"
"To determine the total amount of flour needed, we must first calculate the total number of cookies Carla is making. She is baking 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since two cups of flour are required to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies. To do this, we can divide the total number of cookies by 12 to find the number of dozens: 66 / 12 = 5.5.

To convert 5.5 dozens to a more manageable quantity, we can express it as 5 dozen and 6 cookies. Since 6 cookies is half of a dozen, we need half of 2 cups of flour, which is 1 cup.

Now, we need to calculate the flour required for the remaining 5 dozen cookies. Since 5 dozen cookies require 5 * 2 = 10 cups of flour, we can add this to the 1 cup needed for the remaining 6 cookies.

Therefore, the total flour needed is 10 + 1 = 11 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To find the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can use the formula for finding a fraction of a quantity: (fraction) * (quantity). In this case, the fraction is 2/3 and the quantity is 9,300 pennies.

First, we multiply 2/3 by 9,300:

(2/3) * 9,300 = (2 * 9,300) / 3

Using the distributive property, we can rewrite this as:

(2 * 9,300) / 3 = 18,600 / 3

Now, we can divide 18,600 by 3:

18,600 / 3 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount:

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

Therefore, the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62.

The final answer is: $62"
"To determine the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to calculate the initial number of marbles and then add the marbles she received from her friend.

The initial number of marbles can be calculated by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box: 5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 5 * 50 = 250 marbles.

Now, we add the marbles she received from her friend: 250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles.

Therefore, Maddison now has a total of 270 marbles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To determine the difference in the number of trees between Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we need to establish the number of trees in each yard.

Let's begin by identifying the number of trees in Chris's yard, which is given as 6. We know that Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:

Ferdinand's trees = (1/2) * Chris's trees
Ferdinand's trees = (1/2) * 6
Ferdinand's trees = 3

Now, we need to find the number of trees in Harry's yard. We are told that Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. This can be expressed as:

Harry's trees = 2 * Ferdinand's trees + 5
Harry's trees = 2 * 3 + 5
Harry's trees = 6 + 5
Harry's trees = 11

To find the difference in the number of trees between Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard:

Difference = Harry's trees - Ferdinand's trees
Difference = 11 - 3
Difference = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the combined amount of money the three girls have, we can start by identifying the individual amounts.

Carmen's amount is given as $100. 

Samantha's amount is $25 more than Carmen's, so we can express this as $100 + $25 = $125.

Daisy's amount is $50 more than Samantha's, so we can express this as $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, to find the total amount, we can add the individual amounts together: $100 + $125 + $175.

Using the commutative and associative properties of addition, we can rearrange the terms to simplify the calculation: ($100 + $125) + $175 = $225 + $175.

Now, we can add the two amounts: $225 + $175 = $400.

Therefore, the total amount of money the three girls have combined is $400."
"To determine the total cost of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee as a percentage of the selling price.

The selling price of the house is $350,000. 

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which can be calculated as 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which can be calculated as 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total cost of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find the difference between the total cost and Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total cost: $409,500 - $400,000 = $4,500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees, which amount to 3% of the selling price. This can be expressed as:

Transfer fees = 0.03 \* $400,000 = $12,000

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price:

Brokerage fee = 0.05 \* $400,000 = $20,000

Now, we add the transfer fees and brokerage fee to find the total fees:

Total fees = $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

Subtracting the total fees from the selling price gives us the net selling price:

Net selling price = $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000

Finally, we subtract the remaining loan amount from the net selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds:

Net proceeds = $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to break down the process into its constituent parts.

First, we calculate the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Since it takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees, we need to find 40% of 20 minutes to determine the additional time required to reach 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is calculated as 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Next, we need to find the time it takes to cook the chicken. We are given that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Since it took 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees, the cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken by adding the time it took to heat the oil to 300 degrees, the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees, and the cooking time.

Total time = 20 (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 (to cook) = 71 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{71}$"
"To calculate the total amount spent on advertising, we need to consider the costs of both newspaper and television ads. 

The cost of each newspaper ad is $5, and the agent purchased 50 of them. Therefore, the total cost for newspaper ads is 5 \* 50 = $250.

Similarly, the cost of each television ad is $75, and the agent purchased 15 of them. Thus, the total cost for television ads is 75 \* 15 = $1125.

To find the total amount spent on all ads, we add the costs of newspaper and television ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

The final answer is: $1375"
"To determine the number of blue golf balls, we first need to identify the total number of golf balls, which is half of the total balls the juggler can juggle.

Let's denote the total number of balls as T. We know that T = 16.

Since half of the balls are golf balls, the number of golf balls (G) can be calculated as G = T / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8.

Now, we need to find the number of blue golf balls, which is half of the golf balls. Let's denote the number of blue golf balls as B. We can calculate B as B = G / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4.

Therefore, the number of blue golf balls is 4.

"To determine the total number of M&Ms Mary obtained, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them together.

Let's denote the number of M&Ms in the first bag as x. We know that the second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so the number of M&Ms in the second bag is x + 12. The third bag has a hole in it, so it only has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, which is x/2.

We are given that the first bag has 300 M&Ms. Therefore, we can set up the equation x = 300.

Now, we can calculate the number of M&Ms in the second bag: x + 12 = 300 + 12 = 312.

Next, we calculate the number of M&Ms in the third bag: x/2 = 300/2 = 150.

To find the total number of M&Ms Mary obtained, we add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: x + (x + 12) + (x/2) = 300 + 312 + 150.

Simplifying the expression, we get: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The final answer is: 762"
"Given the problem, we can break it down into manageable components to calculate the total number of windows.

First, we determine the total number of windows in the bedrooms. Since each bedroom has 2 windows and there are 6 bedrooms in total (2 houses with 3 bedrooms each), the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 2 * 6 = 12.

Next, we calculate the total number of additional windows in the houses. There are 4 additional windows in each house, and since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 4 * 2 = 8.

To find the total number of windows, we add the number of windows in the bedrooms to the number of additional windows: 12 + 8 = 20.

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"

- Pasta: $1.35

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35
Total cost = $14.00

Now, we need to find the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount paid, which is $20.

Change = $20 - $14.00
Change = $6.00

Therefore, the change is $6.00."
"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is $\frac{1}{10} \times 900 = 90$ stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is $2 \times 90 = 180$ stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is $90 + 180 = 270$ stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, and the body takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is $1800 - 900 - 270 = 630$ stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes $\frac{630}{2} = 315$ stitches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{315}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

The cost of the tomato seeds can be calculated as follows:

20 packets of tomato seeds * $40 per packet = 20 × 40 = $800

The cost of the celery seeds can be calculated as follows:

80 packets of celery seeds * $30 per packet = 80 × 30 = $2400

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds:

Total cost = $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds is $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break down the information provided.

Let's start with the solo song, which has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 × 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of these lines are Sean's, we can express this as (1/3) × 108 = 36 lines.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, which can be calculated as (4/5) × 60 = 48 lines.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To determine the number of cards with the letter D, we'll break down the problem step by step.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: $\frac{2}{5} \cdot 80 = 32$ cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are $80 - 32 = 48$. Then, $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 48 = 24$ cards have the letter B.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are $48 - 24 = 24$. Then, $\frac{5}{8} \cdot 24 = 15$ cards have the letter C.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: $80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Let's start by calculating the time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 3 × 30 = 90 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 10 × 15 = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for small holes and large holes to find the total time: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 240 minutes ÷ 60 = 4 hours.

Therefore, the total time it takes Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is 4 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Given that the sum of Mico and Marco's ages is 20, we can express this as an equation: M + m = 20, where M represents Mico's current age and m represents Marco's current age.

To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 to each of their current ages. This can be represented as (M + 10) + (m + 10).

Since M + m = 20, we can substitute this into the equation (M + 10) + (m + 10) to get (20 + 10) + (20 + 10). Simplifying this expression, we get 30 + 30 = 60.

Therefore, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"Let's analyze the given problem. We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

Therefore, Sam's current age is 6 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

The cost of the popsicles can be calculated using the formula for the cost of a set of items: 

Cost = Number of items * Price per item
Cost = 20 * $0.25
Cost = $5

The cost of the ice cream bars can be calculated using the same formula:

Cost = Number of items * Price per item
Cost = 4 * $0.50
Cost = $2

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars:

Total Cost = Cost of popsicles + Cost of ice cream bars
Total Cost = $5 + $2
Total Cost = $7

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we can use the formula: Total Spots = Number of Cobras * Spots per Cobra. Given that there are 40 cobras and each cobra has 70 spots, we can calculate the total spots as follows:

Total Spots (Cobras) = 40 * 70
Total Spots (Cobras) = 2800

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we can find the spots per mamba by dividing the spots per cobra by 2:

Spots per Mamba = Spots per Cobra / 2
Spots per Mamba = 70 / 2
Spots per Mamba = 35

Now, we can find the total number of spots on the mambas by multiplying the number of mambas by the spots per mamba:

Total Spots (Mambas) = Number of Mambas * Spots per Mamba
Total Spots (Mambas) = 60 * 35
Total Spots (Mambas) = 2100

To find the total number of spots on both cobras and mambas, we add the total spots on each group:

Total Spots = Total Spots (Cobras) + Total Spots (Mambas)
Total Spots = 2800 + 2100
Total Spots = 4900

Finally, we find half the total number of spots by dividing the total by 2:

Half Total Spots = Total Spots / 2
Half Total Spots = 4900 / 2
Half Total Spots = 2450

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the total amount Maddy will spend on pizzas, we need to calculate the total number of people she needs to buy pizza for and then multiply that by the cost per pizza.

First, let's find the total number of people. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. Therefore, the total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Now, we can calculate the total amount Maddy will spend by multiplying the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza: 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to calculate the total length of the spaces between the topaz gemstones and then divide that by the length of each bead.

Given that each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and there are 8 of them, the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 \* 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. The length of the spaces between the gemstones can be found by subtracting the length taken up by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since there are 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them. The length of each space is the total length of the spaces divided by the number of spaces: 17 / 7 = 2.428571... inches.

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we divide the length of each space by the length of each bead: 2.428571... / (1/4) = 2.428571... * 4 = 9.714285...

"To calculate the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot, we need to consider their production in two distinct periods: the first week and the second week.

Let's denote the number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot in the first week as A, B, and M, respectively. We are given that A = 20, B = 40, and M = 60.

The total number of stories written in the first week is the sum of the individual contributions: A + B + M = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120.

In the second week, each of them doubled their production from the first week. Therefore, the new number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot in the second week is 2A, 2B, and 2M, respectively.

The total number of stories written in the second week is the sum of the doubled contributions: 2A + 2B + 2M = 2(20 + 40 + 60) = 2(120) = 240.

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week: 120 + 240 = 360.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"Given that Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can express this relationship as an equation: 

Let B represent the brother's age. Then, B = 2 * 9, since the brother's age is twice Ann's age.

B = 2 * 9
B = 18

Now, we need to find the brother's age in 3 years. To do this, we add 3 to his current age.

Brother's age in 3 years = B + 3
= 18 + 3
= 21

Therefore, the brother will be 21 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left after purchasing a can of pop, we need to calculate the total value of her quarters and dimes, then subtract the cost of the pop.

First, let's calculate the total value of her quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, we can express this as:

5 quarters × 25 cents/quarter = 5 × 25 cents = 125 cents

Next, we calculate the total value of her dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so:

2 dimes × 10 cents/dime = 2 × 10 cents = 20 cents

Now, we add the total value of her quarters and dimes to find the initial amount of money Kelly has:

125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents

The cost of the can of pop is 55 cents. To find the amount of money Kelly has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the initial amount:

145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

Therefore, Kelly has 90 cents left after purchasing the can of pop.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of rows of 5-star rows on the flag, we can start by calculating the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

The number of stars in the 8-star rows is given by 3 * 8 = 24.
The number of stars in the 6-star rows is given by 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Now, we can find the number of rows of 5-star rows by dividing the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by the number of stars per row, which is 5.

Therefore, the number of rows of 5-star rows is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of trucks required to transport 80 flagstones, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of the trucks.

The weight of each flagstone is given as 75 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of 80 flagstones can be calculated as follows:

Total weight = Number of flagstones × Weight of each flagstone
Total weight = 80 × 75 pounds
Total weight = 6000 pounds

Now, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks, which is 2000 pounds per truck:

Number of trucks = Total weight ÷ Weight capacity per truck
Number of trucks = 6000 pounds ÷ 2000 pounds/truck
Number of trucks = 3

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"Given that the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, we can determine the speed of the car in the slow lane as 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

To find the time taken by the car in the fast lane, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. Given that the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles, we can calculate its time as follows:

time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour, we can use the same formula to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane:

time = distance / speed = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

Therefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance is 16 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Let's analyze the problem.

Given that Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, we can express Izzy's medals as 22 - 5 = 17. The combined total of their medals is 22 + 17 = 39.

We are also given that together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This can be expressed as an equation: 10x = 39, where x is the total number of medals given out.

To find x, we need to solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 10:

$$
\begin{aligned}
10x &= 39 \\
\frac{10x}{10} &= \frac{39}{10} \\
x &= \frac{39}{10} \\
x &= 3.9
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.9}$"
"Given that 4 adults and 8 children are to share 8 packets of chocolate bars, with each packet containing 5 chocolate bars, we can calculate the total number of chocolate bars available as follows:

Total chocolate bars = Number of packets * Number of chocolate bars per packet
Total chocolate bars = 8 * 5
Total chocolate bars = 40

Since each adult receives 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars distributed to adults is:

Total chocolate bars for adults = Number of adults * Chocolate bars per adult
Total chocolate bars for adults = 4 * 6
Total chocolate bars for adults = 24

To determine the remaining chocolate bars for the children, we subtract the total chocolate bars given to adults from the total available:

Remaining chocolate bars for children = Total chocolate bars - Total chocolate bars for adults
Remaining chocolate bars for children = 40 - 24
Remaining chocolate bars for children = 16

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars each child will receive. Since there are 8 children, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children:

Chocolate bars per child = Remaining chocolate bars for children / Number of children
Chocolate bars per child = 16 / 8
Chocolate bars per child = 2

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine Susan's earnings, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a 3-hour period. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

The time she works is given by:

t = 3 hours - 0.5 hours
t = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes first.

t (in minutes) = 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour
t (in minutes) = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

Number of intervals = t (in minutes) / 10 minutes
= 150 minutes / 10 minutes
= 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

Earnings = Number of intervals * $5/interval
= 15 intervals * $5/interval
= $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Let's denote the points of Mike, Jim, and Tony as M, J, and T, respectively. We are given that M = 21, J = M - 3, and T = 2M.

We can substitute the value of M into the equations for J and T:
J = 21 - 3 = 18
T = 2(21) = 42

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
We can express this condition as:
M + 1, if M > 20
J + 1, if J > 20
T + 1, if T > 20

Since M = 21, J = 18, and T = 42, we can determine the updated points for each player:
M = 21 (no extra point, since 21 is not greater than 20)
J = 18 (no extra point, since 18 is not greater than 20)
T = 42 (extra point, since 42 is greater than 20)

Now, we can calculate the updated points for each player:
M = 21
J = 18
T = 42 + 1 = 43

To find the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we add their updated points:
Total points = M + J + T = 21 + 18 + 43 = 82

The final answer is: $\boxed{82}$"
"Given the scenario, we can break it down as follows:

Let's denote the age of the youngest son as 'y'. Since the youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, we can express the age of the oldest son as 2y. We are given that the oldest son is 8 years old, so we can set up the equation:

2y = 8

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

y = 8 / 2
y = 4

Now that we know the ages of both sons, we can determine how many oranges they washed. The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. In total, they wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

To find the number of oranges left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges:

15 - 12 = 3

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of exercises for each day and add them together.

Let's break down the exercises for each day:

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Total for Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120 (an increase of 20 from Day 1)
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40 (a decrease of 10 from Day 1)
- Dumbbell presses: 20 × 2 = 40 (doubling the number from Day 1)

Total for Day 2: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Now, we can find the total count of activities in two days by adding the totals for each day: 170 + 200 = 370.

The final answer is: 370"
"To determine the duration a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household with 5 members who consume rice every lunch and dinner, we first calculate the daily rice consumption.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. Therefore, the daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals/day = 0.4 kg/day.

For 5 members, the total daily consumption is 5 * 0.4 kg/day = 2 kg/day.

To find the duration the rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the daily consumption (2 kg/day).

42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the duration in weeks by dividing the total number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and subtract that from his target.

Let's break down the given information:

- Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any crates on those days.
- He sold 20 crates over the weekend.
- He sold 15 crates on Tuesday.
- He sold 12 crates on Wednesday.
- He sold 18 crates on Thursday.

We can calculate the total number of crates sold by adding the number of crates sold on each day:

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18
Total crates sold = 65

Now, we can calculate the difference between the target and the total number of crates sold to determine how many crates Sam was off from his target:

Target = 120 crates
Crates off target = Target - Total crates sold
Crates off target = 120 - 65
Crates off target = 55

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates off from his target.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"The problem at hand is a classic example of an arithmetic series, where the bids on the desk form a sequence with a common difference of $50. We are given that the initial bid is $200, and there are 3 other bidders who each place a single bid, followed by Carmen's bid. This results in a total of 6 bids.

To find the total cost of the desk, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

$$S_n = \frac{n}{2} \left(2a + (n-1)d\right)$$

where $S_n$ is the sum of the first n terms, $a$ is the first term, $d$ is the common difference, and $n$ is the number of terms.

In this case, we have:

$a = 200$ (initial bid)
$d = 50$ (common difference)
$n = 6$ (total number of bids)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

$$S_6 = \frac{6}{2} \left(2(200) + (6-1)50\right)$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$S_6 = 3 \left(400 + 250\right)$$

$$S_6 = 3 \cdot 650$$

$$S_6 = 1950$$

Therefore, the total cost of the desk is $1950.

The final answer is: $1950"
"To determine the total cost of the driving service, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total driving cost, and the total bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven. Since John commutes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. 

The total miles driven per week is then 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. 

To find the total miles driven per year, we multiply the total miles driven per week by the number of weeks worked in a year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Next, we calculate the total driving cost. John is charged $2 per mile driven. Therefore, the total driving cost per year is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus. John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. To find the total bonus per year, we multiply the monthly bonus by 12: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

Finally, we find the total cost per year by adding the total driving cost and the total bonus: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year.

The final numerical answer is: $31800"
"To determine the amount of time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we must first calculate the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday. 

Let's denote the time Peter exercised on Monday as M and the time he exercised on Sunday as S. We are given that M = 16 minutes and S = 23 minutes.

The total time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday is the sum of M and S, which is M + S. 

M + S = 16 + 23
M + S = 39

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the total time by 2.

2(M + S) = 2(39)
2(M + S) = 78

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"The problem of determining the number of pieces of paper required for a 32-page tabloid can be approached by analyzing the folding pattern and the resulting page arrangement.

When a piece of paper is folded, it creates two sides: the left and right sides. To create a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the number of pages on each side of the folded paper.

Let's denote the number of pages on the left side as $L$ and the number of pages on the right side as $R$. Since the paper is folded in half, the total number of pages on each side is equal to half the total number of pages in the tabloid, which is 32.

We can express this as:

$$L + R = 32$$

However, we also know that the number of pages on each side is equal to half the total number of pages, so we can write:

$$L = R = 16$$

Since each piece of paper can be folded in half to create two sides, we need two pieces of paper for each side of the tabloid.

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is:

$$2L = 2R = 2(16) = 32$$

However, this is not the correct answer, as we are counting each piece of paper twice. We need to divide the total number of pages by 2 to get the correct answer.

$$\frac{32}{2} = 16$$

However, this is still not the correct answer. We need to consider that each piece of paper can be folded in half to create two sides, but we are counting each piece of paper only once.

Since each piece of paper can be folded in half to create two sides, we need two pieces of paper for each side of the tabloid. However, we are counting each piece of paper only once.

To get the correct answer, we need to consider that we need two pieces of paper for each side of the tabloid, but we are counting each piece of paper only once.

The correct answer is that we need 2 pieces of paper for the first 16 pages (left and right sides) and another 2 pieces of paper for the last 16 pages (left and right sides).

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is:

$$2 + 2 = 4$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount of money Annika has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on food and snacks. Since she spent half of $50, we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 50$. To simplify this, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 2 to get $25.

Next, we need to add the additional $10 she spent on rides. So, the total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, we can subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

Therefore, Annika has $15 left.

The final answer is: $15"
"Given the scenario, let's analyze the information provided:

Let the number of books sold in the first year be x. Since Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year, we can express the number of books sold in the first year as 2y, where y is the number of books sold in the current year. We are given that y = 45, so x = 2y = 2(45) = 90.

We know that the total number of books is 250, and there are 50 unsold books. Therefore, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200. We can express this as the sum of the books sold in the first year, the second year, and the current year:

x + y + z = 200

where z is the number of books sold in the second year. We already know that x = 90 and y = 45, so we can substitute these values into the equation:

90 + 45 + z = 200

Combine like terms:

135 + z = 200

Subtract 135 from both sides:

z = 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:

Total money earned in the second year = z * 20
= 65 * 20
= $1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To determine Watson's total earnings in April, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then multiply it by the number of weeks in April.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week.

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are: 50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week.

Additionally, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are: $500/week + $300/week = $800/week.

April has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are: $800/week * 4 weeks = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To determine the number of people John lost to, we need to calculate the percentage of people he did not beat, which is 100% - 80% = 20%. 

Now, we can find 20% of 20 by multiplying 0.20 by 20:

0.20 * 20 = 4

Therefore, John lost to 4 people.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we need to calculate the remaining loaves after the morning sales and then find half of that amount.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. This can be expressed as:

60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning

Now, we need to find the remaining loaves after the morning sales:

60 - 40 = 20 loaves left

Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, we can calculate this as:

20 * (1/2) = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon

Therefore, the bakery sells 10 loaves of bread in the afternoon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. 

First, let's find out how much weight Joey loses per week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find the weight lost per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we can set up a proportion to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. Let x be the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. We can set up the proportion: 2 pounds/week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks. 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 2x = 8 * 4. 

Now, we can simplify the equation: 2x = 32. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 32 / 2. 

x = 16.

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

Let's start with the tubs of ice cream. The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 × $13 = $26. The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 × $11 = $22. Therefore, the savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

Next, let's consider the packets of milk. The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 × $1 = $4. The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 × ($1 - $0.5) = 4 × $0.5 = $2. Consequently, the savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

Now, we can calculate the total savings by adding the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk: $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the total number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after 15 days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs separately and then add them together.

Let's start by finding the number of extra arms. Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, we can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence:

n = (L - F) / d + 1

where n is the number of terms, L is the last term (15 days), F is the first term (0, since the first arm grows on day 3), and d is the common difference (3 days).

n = (15 - 0) / 3 + 1
n = 15 / 3 + 1
n = 5 + 1
n = 6

However, this represents the number of 3-day intervals, not the number of extra arms. Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, we can simply divide the total number of days by 3 to find the number of extra arms:

Extra arms = 15 / 3
Extra arms = 5

Now, let's find the number of extra legs. Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, we can use the same formula:

n = (L - F) / d + 1

n = (15 - 0) / 5 + 1
n = 15 / 5 + 1
n = 3 + 1
n = 4

However, this represents the number of 5-day intervals, not the number of extra legs. Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, we can simply divide the total number of days by 5 to find the number of extra legs:

Extra legs = 15 / 5
Extra legs = 3

Now, we can find the total number of new limbs by adding the number of extra arms and legs:

Total new limbs = Extra arms + Extra legs
Total new limbs = 5 + 3
Total new limbs = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the expenses and savings.

Let's break down the costs:

1. Business suits: 6 suits at $100 each = 6 × $100 = $600
2. Suitcases: 3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 × $50 = $150
3. Flight ticket: The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times this amount is 5 × $100 = $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of these items: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo's initial budget is $6000. After subtracting the total cost of the items, we get $6000 - $1950 = $4050.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract this from his remaining budget: $4050 - $2000 = $2050.

Therefore, the amount he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is $2050.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption and then multiply it by 7.

Let's break it down: there are 5 family members, with 3 of them consuming 3 eggs each day and the remaining 2 consuming 2 eggs each day. 

The daily consumption of the 3 individuals is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. 

The daily consumption of the 2 individuals is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

The total daily consumption is the sum of these two, which is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week.

The final answer is: 91"
"Given the problem, we can establish a linear relationship between the ages of Trent, Jane, and Quinn. Let's denote Quinn's age as Q, Jane's age as J, and Trent's age as T.

We are given that Quinn is 30 years old, so Q = 30.

We also know that Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, which can be expressed as J = Q - 3.

Substituting the value of Q into the equation, we get J = 30 - 3 = 27.

Now, we are told that Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so T = J + 5.

Substituting the value of J into the equation, we get T = 27 + 5 = 32.

Therefore, Trent's age is 32.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish the following variables:

Let N be Noah's current age, and P be the current population of Chile.

We are given that six years ago, Cera was 46 years old, and at that time, Noah was half as old as Cera. This implies that Noah's age six years ago was 40/2 = 20 years. Since we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, we can express this as:

P/2 = 3000 * 20

where P/2 represents the population of Chile six years ago, and 3000 * 20 is the population of Chile six years ago expressed in terms of Noah's age.

Solving for P, we get:

P/2 = 60000

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

P = 120000

Therefore, the current population of Chile is 120000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120000}$"
"To determine the number of players on the defense, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D.

We are told that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is 2D. Additionally, there are half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense, which gives us D/2 players on the special teams.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2.

We are given that the total number of players is 105. So, we can set up the equation:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

D = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the number of people attending Martha's party, we need to calculate the total number of people invited and then subtract those who couldn't attend due to illness and previous commitments.

First, let's find the total number of people invited. We have 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people.

Total people from 2 families with 6 people: 2 × 6 = 12
Total people from 3 families with 4 people: 3 × 4 = 12
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24

Now, we need to account for the people who couldn't attend due to illness. 8 people were unable to come, so we subtract them from the total number of people invited.

24 - 8 = 16

However, 1/4 of the people who couldn't attend due to illness had previous commitments. To find this number, we calculate 1/4 of 8, which is 8/4 = 2.

Now, we subtract the people who had previous commitments from the number of people who couldn't attend due to illness.

2 people had previous commitments, so we subtract them from the 8 people who couldn't attend due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6

Now, we subtract the total number of people who couldn't attend (due to illness and previous commitments) from the total number of people invited.

16 - 6 = 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Let's denote the number of marbles Solomon bought from Johanna as $n$. We know that his father gave him $2/5$ times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, which is $\frac{2}{5}n$. The total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is the sum of the marbles he bought and the marbles already in the store, which is $n + 50$.

We are given that Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna. Therefore, $n = 20$. Substituting this value into the expression for the total number of marbles in the store, we get $20 + 50 = 70$.

Now, we need to find the number of marbles his father gave him. We know that his father gave him $\frac{2}{5}$ times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, which is $\frac{2}{5} \cdot 20 = 8$.

The total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is the sum of the marbles he bought, the marbles already in the store, and the marbles his father gave him, which is $70 + 8 = 78$.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: $78 \cdot 2 = 156$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To determine the cost of filling the pool, we must first calculate its volume. The pool is a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length (l) = 6 feet
- Width (w) = 4 feet
- Height (h) = 5 feet

We can now calculate the volume:
V = lwh = 6 * 4 * 5 = 120 cubic feet

Next, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost per cubic foot is $0.1. To find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:
Total cost = V * cost per cubic foot = 120 * 0.1 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"Given the problem, we can approach it by first identifying the number of girls and nongendered children in relation to the number of boys.

Let's denote the number of boys as B. We are given that the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, so the number of girls (G) can be expressed as G = 3B. We are also given that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children (N) can be expressed as N = (1/10)B.

We are given that B = 30. Therefore, we can calculate the number of girls and nongendered children as follows:

G = 3B = 3(30) = 90
N = (1/10)B = (1/10)(30) = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:

Total children = B + G + N = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can express this relationship as a fraction, where the number of electric poles (x) is to the number of electric wires (3x). We are told that the total number of electric wires needed is 45.

To find the number of electric poles, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

$$\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{45}{3}$$

$$x = \frac{45}{3}$$

$$x = 15$$

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"Given the initial population of 25 men and 15 women, the total number of individuals at the party is 40. We are informed that 1/4 of the total number of people left after an hour. To determine the number of individuals who departed, we calculate 1/4 of 40, which is $\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10$.

The remaining population is then 40 - 10 = 30. We are given that 22 men stayed at the party, indicating that 25 - 22 = 3 men left. Consequently, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7, as 10 individuals departed in total and 3 of them were men.

To find the number of women remaining, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women: 15 - 7 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"Given that a magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

Let's denote the cost of the book as B and the cost of the magazine as M. We know that M = 0.5B. Since B = $4, we can substitute this value into the equation to find M:

M = 0.5B
M = 0.5($4)
M = $2

Now, we are given that a pen costs $1 less than a magazine. Let's denote the cost of the pen as P. We can express this relationship as:

P = M - $1
P = $2 - $1
P = $1

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we first need to calculate the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with an unknown number of pencils in each box, denoted as x, and 2 loose pencils. This gives us a total of 3x + 2 pencils. We are also given that Jam has a total of 26 pencils. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3x + 2 = 26

Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation gives us:

3x = 24

Dividing both sides of the equation by 3 yields:

x = 24/3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can find the total number of pencils Jam has: 3 boxes * 8 pencils per box = 24 pencils, plus the 2 loose pencils, which gives us a total of 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the weakening of the coffee, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

Let's denote the initial volume of the coffee as V. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and weakens it by 12 milliliters. We want to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, so we need to find the number of ice cubes required to achieve this.

The temperature difference is 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Therefore, the number of ice cubes needed is:

65 / 13 = 5

Since each ice cube weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters, the total weakening caused by the ice cubes is:

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters

Now, let's consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. The weakening caused by the cream is directly proportional to the volume added, so the weakening caused by the cream is:

15 milliliters

The total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the cream:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"Given the scenario, we can model the problem as a ratio of old records to new records. The ratio is 2:1, meaning 2 old records are traded for 1 new record. We are given that 5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records between them.

Let's denote the number of old records each person brings in as x. Since there are 5 people, the total number of old records is 5x. The total number of new records is given as 7.

We can set up a proportion based on the ratio of old records to new records:

2x = 7

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 7/2
x = 3.5

However, since we are dealing with a physical quantity (records), we can round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we are looking for the total number of old records, so we can multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people.

Total number of old records = 5x
Total number of old records = 5 * 3.5
Total number of old records = 17.5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a record, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can also consider that the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1, and the total number of new records is 7. This means that the total number of old records is twice the number of new records.

Total number of old records = 2 * 7
Total number of old records = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Given that the company has 100 employees, with senior programmers earning $400 more than junior programmers, we can start by determining the number of junior programmers.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which can be expressed as:

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) × 100
= 2 × 20
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers:

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers × Salary of junior programmers
= 40 × $2000
= $80,000

The salary of senior programmers is $400 more than that of junior programmers:

Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers:

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers × Salary of senior programmers
= 60 × $2400
= $144,000

The total amount paid to all programmers is the sum of the amounts paid to junior and senior programmers:

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80,000 + $144,000
= $224,000

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were x people on the bus. 
At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5. 
At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2. 
Then, 8 more people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6. 
We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, we can break down the sequence of events into a series of mathematical operations.

Let's denote the initial number of lollipops as $L_0 = 24$. 

1. Oscar eats 2 lollipops on his way to school, so the number of lollipops remaining is $L_1 = L_0 - 2 = 24 - 2 = 22$.
2. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends, leaving him with $L_2 = L_1 - 14 = 22 - 14 = 8$ lollipops.
3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is $2 \times 14 = 28$ lollipops. Therefore, the total number of lollipops he has now is $L_3 = L_2 + 28 = 8 + 28 = 36$.
4. He eats 3 more lollipops that night, so the number of lollipops remaining is $L_4 = L_3 - 3 = 36 - 3 = 33$.
5. Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, leaving him with $L_5 = L_4 - 2 = 33 - 2 = 31$ lollipops.

Therefore, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"Given that the cell-phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can establish a linear relationship between the charge and time. 

Let's denote the total charge as 100% and the time required to reach full charge as t hours. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

The charging rate is 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, which is equivalent to 20 percentage-points per hour (60 minutes/hour * 1/3 minutes/percentage-point). 

To find the time it takes to charge the remaining 40%, we can set up a proportion:

40 percentage-points / 20 percentage-points/hour = t hours

Solving for t, we get:

t = 40 / 20
t = 2 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Erin has left, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. Initially, Erin possesses 7 lollipops. Her mother then provides her with 10 additional lollipops, resulting in a total of 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Subsequently, Erin donates 3 lollipops to Ella. To find the number of lollipops Erin retains, we subtract 3 from the total: 17 - 3 = 14.

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops remaining.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Given the customer's loyalty card rewards structure, we can calculate the amount they paid on the current shopping trip as follows:

Let's start by determining the rewards earned from the last shopping trip. The customer spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. Therefore, the rewards earned are calculated as:

Rewards = (Total Spent / Reward Threshold) = ($80 / $20) = 4

Now, let's consider the current shopping trip. The customer spent $43 and used their rewards, which is $4 off the price. Additionally, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total discount is the sum of the rewards and the coupon discount:

Total Discount = Rewards + (2 * Rewards) = $4 + $8 = $12

To find the amount the customer paid, we subtract the total discount from the amount spent on the current shopping trip:

Amount Paid = Total Spent - Total Discount = $43 - $12 = $31

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine which job offers a higher net pay, we need to calculate the net income for each job, taking into account the property tax and income tax.

For Job A, the calculation is straightforward:

Total income = $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year

Since there's no property tax mentioned for Job A, we proceed to calculate the income tax:

Income tax = $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000

Net income for Job A = Total income - Income tax = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B, we have a total income of $42,000 and a property tax of $6,000. We first calculate the net income before tax:

Net income before tax = Total income - Property tax = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000

Next, we calculate the income tax:

Income tax = $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600

Now, we calculate the net income for Job B:

Net income for Job B = Net income before tax - Income tax = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B:

Difference in net pay = Net income for Job B - Net income for Job A = $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To determine the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we first need to calculate the total number of ruined castles. Given that 40% of the 220 castles are ruins, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 40 by 100.

40% = 40/100 = 0.4

Now, we can multiply this decimal by the total number of castles to find the number of ruined castles.

Number of ruined castles = 0.4 * 220
= 88

Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we can find this number by dividing the total number of ruined castles by 2.

Number of unmanned ruined castles = 88 / 2
= 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost of each offer. 

Let's start by calculating the total cost of Furniture United's offer. The advance payment is $1,350, and the monthly installments are $350 each for 6 months. We can calculate the total cost of the installments using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Total cost of installments = (n/2) * (a1 + an)

where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

For Furniture United's offer, n = 6, a1 = $350, and an = $350. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Total cost of installments = (6/2) * ($350 + $350)
= 3 * $700
= $2,100

Now, we add the advance payment to the total cost of the installments to get the total cost of Furniture United's offer:

Total cost of Furniture United's offer = $1,350 + $2,100
= $3,450

Next, let's calculate the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer. The advance payment is $1,100, and the monthly installments are $250 each for 9 months. Using the same formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, we get:

Total cost of installments = (n/2) * (a1 + an)
= (9/2) * ($250 + $250)
= 4.5 * $500
= $2,250

Now, we add the advance payment to the total cost of the installments to get the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer:

Total cost of Cozy Homes' offer = $1,100 + $2,250
= $3,350

The cost difference between the two offers is $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"

To find the number of guns each person would have, we use the formula:

Number of guns per person = T / P

Substituting the values, we get:

Number of guns per person = 24 / 4

Using basic arithmetic operations, we can simplify this expression:

Number of guns per person = 6

Therefore, each person would have 6 paintball guns if they were shared equally.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we must calculate the amount required for 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

First, let's calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers. Since each batch requires 30 ounces of sugar, we can use the formula:

Sugar for suckers = Number of batches × Sugar per batch
Sugar for suckers = 8 × 30
Sugar for suckers = 240 ounces

Next, we need to calculate the amount of sugar required for 1 batch of fudge, which is given as 70 ounces.

Now, we can find the total amount of sugar needed by adding the sugar required for suckers and fudge:

Total sugar = Sugar for suckers + Sugar for fudge
Total sugar = 240 + 70
Total sugar = 310 ounces

Therefore, Mason needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

The final answer is: 310"
"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

Let's denote the initial price of each share as $8. The stock price increases by 50% in the first year, which can be represented as a multiplication by 1.5 (1 + 0.5). Therefore, the price of each share after the first year is $8 * 1.5 = $12.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%, which can be represented as a multiplication by 0.75 (1 - 0.25). Therefore, the price of each share after the second year is $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we can calculate the total value of all shares by multiplying the price of each share after the second year by the total number of shares, which is 8. The total value of all shares is $9 * 8 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To determine the difference in the number of hot dogs eaten by John and Luke, we need to establish the quantities consumed by each individual.

Let's denote the number of hot dogs Luke ate as L. Given that Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, we can express the number of hot dogs Thomas ate as 3L. Since we know Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can equate L to 2.

Now, we can calculate the number of hot dogs Thomas ate: 3L = 3(2) = 6.

Next, we need to find the number of hot dogs John ate, which is half the amount Thomas ate. This can be expressed as (1/2) * 6 = 3.

To find the difference in the number of hot dogs eaten by John and Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

"Given a class of 200 students divided into 3 groups, with 2 groups being equal in number and the third group being 10 students less than each of the other groups, we can express this as an equation.

Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as x. The number of students in the third group is then x - 10.

The total number of students in the class is the sum of the students in all three groups, which is equal to 200. This can be expressed as:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms to simplify the equation:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with the variable:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:

x = 70

Since the third group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the third group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"Let's analyze the problem. We are given that Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, consisting of chickens and cows. It's also stated that he has twice as many chickens as cows. We can represent the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as H. Therefore, we have the equation H = 2C.

Since the total number of animals is 60, we can express this as the sum of the number of cows and chickens: C + H = 60. Substituting H = 2C into this equation, we get C + 2C = 60, which simplifies to 3C = 60.

To find the value of C, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in C = 20. Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting C into the equation H = 2C, yielding H = 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs of the chickens is 2 * 40 = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows is 4 * 20 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the number of balls Josh starts juggling with after the talent show, we need to consider his initial juggling act and the events that occurred during the performance.

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. This is an arithmetic sequence with a first term of 3 and a common difference of 1. The number of balls Josh has after 4 weeks can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:

a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d

where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, n is the number of terms, and d is the common difference.

Plugging in the values, we get:

a_5 = 3 + (5 - 1)1
a_5 = 3 + 4
a_5 = 7

So, Josh starts with 7 balls.

When he drops 3 balls, 2 are caught, so 1 ball is lost. This can be represented as:

Initial number of balls = 7
Number of balls lost = 1

Number of balls remaining = Initial number of balls - Number of balls lost
= 7 - 1
= 6

Therefore, Josh starts juggling with 6 balls.

"To determine the total distance Tyson covered in June, we need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run based on his coach's advice.

Let's denote the original daily distance as $d = 5000$ meters. The coach wants him to run $\frac{1}{5}$ times more meters in a day. To find this additional distance, we can calculate $\frac{1}{5}d = \frac{1}{5} \cdot 5000 = 1000$ meters.

Therefore, the new daily distance is $d + \frac{1}{5}d = 5000 + 1000 = 6000$ meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, the total distance covered in June is given by the product of the new daily distance and the number of days: $6000 \cdot 30 = 180,000$ meters.

"To determine the number of cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies used by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in a bag.

Let's start by calculating the number of cookies eaten by Jenny's son. He eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, which is a simple arithmetic sequence. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence is S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, the number of terms (n) is 5, the first term (a1) is 4, and the last term (an) is also 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = 5/2 * (4 + 4)
S = 5/2 * 8
S = 20

So, Jenny's son eats 20 cookies a week.

Next, we need to calculate the number of cookies eaten by Jenny's husband. He eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, which is a simple arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 0 (since the number of cookies eaten per day is constant). The sum of this sequence is simply the product of the number of terms and the first term:

S = n * a1
S = 7 * 1
S = 7

So, Jenny's husband eats 7 cookies a week.

Now, we can calculate the total number of cookies used by her son and husband:

Total cookies used = 20 (by son) + 7 (by husband)
Total cookies used = 27

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, we can subtract the total number of cookies used by her son and husband from the total number of cookies in a bag to find the number of cookies eaten by Jenny:

Cookies eaten by Jenny = 36 - 27
Cookies eaten by Jenny = 9

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To calculate the total cost of the shirts, we first need to determine the discount amount. The discount is 40% of the original price of $30.

Discount = 40% of $30
= 0.4 * $30
= $12

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price of one shirt.

Discounted price of one shirt = $30 - $12
= $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2 to find the total cost.

Total cost = $18 * 2
= $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the percentage increase in the amount the factory makes per day, we need to calculate the difference in their daily earnings before and after switching from producing tractors to silos.

Let's denote the daily earnings from producing tractors as $E_{\text{tractors}}$ and the daily earnings from producing silos as $E_{\text{silos}}$. We are given that $E_{\text{tractors}} = 10 \times \$100 = \$1000$ and $E_{\text{silos}} = 5 \times \$220 = \$1100$.

The difference in their daily earnings is $E_{\text{silos}} - E_{\text{tractors}} = \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100$.

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:

$$\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{E_{\text{silos}} - E_{\text{tractors}}}{E_{\text{tractors}}} \right) \times 100\%$$

Substituting the values, we get:

$$\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100\% = 10\%$$

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now compared to when they produced tractors.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total annual expenditure on the dog, we need to calculate the monthly cost and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the monthly cost of food. Since the cost of food is given per week, we need to multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

Food cost per week = $25
Number of weeks in a month = 4
Food cost per month = 25 \* 4 = $100

Next, we add the cost of treats and medicine to the food cost to get the total monthly expenditure.

Treats cost per month = $20
Medicine cost per month = $100
Total cost per month = 100 + 20 + 100 = $220

Now, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12 to get the total annual expenditure.

Total cost per year = 220 \* 12 = $2640

The final answer is: $2640"
"To determine the total time spent on Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and sum them up.

Let's start by defining the time for each activity:

- Monday's yoga class: 1 hour
- Tuesday's cooking class: Since it lasts three times as long as Monday's yoga, we can express this as 3 × 1 = 3 hours
- Wednesday's cheese-tasting event: This event lasts half an hour, which can be represented as 0.5 hours
- Thursday's museum tour: The museum tour takes half as long as the cooking class, so we can express this as (3 / 2) hours
- Friday's errands: 2 hours

Now, let's add up the time for all activities:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + (3 / 2) + 2

To simplify the expression, we can first calculate the value of (3 / 2), which is 1.5. Then, we can add up the values:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

Therefore, the total time spent on Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7.5}$"
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs and subtract that from the number she already bought.

Let's denote the number of plant pots needed for the daisies as D and the number of plant pots needed for the roses as R. We know that D = 30 and R = 2D = 2(30) = 60.

The total number of plant pots needed is the sum of D and R, which is D + R = 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April already bought 100 plant pots, we can find the number of plant pots she has left over by subtracting the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount Andrea saved, we can use a simple subtraction problem. Let's denote the amount she saved as 'x'. We know that after saving, she had $36 - x left. After spending $11 on a sweater, she had $36 - x - $11 left. Then, after giving her brother $4, she had $36 - x - $11 - $4 left.

We are given that she had $36 initially. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

$36 - x - $11 - $4 = $21

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$36 - x - $15 = $21

Combine like terms:

$21 - x = $21

Subtract $21 from both sides:

-x = $0

Multiply both sides by -1:

x = -$0

x = $0

However, this is not possible since Andrea must have saved some money. Let's re-examine the problem. We know that after spending $11 on a sweater and giving her brother $4, she had $21 left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

$36 - x - $11 - $4 = $21

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$36 - x - $15 = $21

Combine like terms:

$21 - x = $21

Subtract $21 from both sides:

-x = $0

"To determine the time John spent sightseeing, we need to calculate the total time spent on all activities and then find 40% of that total.

First, let's calculate the time spent on boating and swimming. Since John spent half the time swimming as he did boating, we can express this as:

Boating time = 6 hours
Swimming time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Next, we'll calculate the time spent watching shows. Since there were 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours, the total time spent watching shows is:

Time spent watching shows = 3 shows * 2 hours per show = 6 hours

Now, we can find the total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows:

Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows = 6 hours + 3 hours + 6 hours = 15 hours

We are given that the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. We can express this as an equation:

0.30 * Total time = 6 hours

To find the total time, we can solve for it:

Total time = 6 hours / 0.30
Total time = 20 hours

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:

Time spent sightseeing = 0.40 * 20 hours
Time spent sightseeing = 8 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the amount Annabelle still needs to save for the phone, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job, where she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work:

$$
\text{Earnings from first job} = 10 \times 20 = 200
$$

Next, we'll calculate her earnings from the second job, where she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work:

$$
\text{Earnings from second job} = 5 \times 15 = 75
$$

Now, we'll find her total earnings by adding her earnings from both jobs:

$$
\text{Total earnings} = 200 + 75 = 275
$$

Since Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, we'll subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone to determine how much more she needs to save:

$$
\text{Amount still needed} = 400 - 275 = 125
$$

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $125 to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $125"
"Given the problem, we can approach it by first defining the heights of the three trees. Let's denote the height of the shortest tree as $s$, the height of the second tree as $s + 5$, and the height of the tallest tree as $2(s + (s + 5))$.

We are given that the shortest tree has a height of 6 feet, so $s = 6$. 

The height of the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, which is $s + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11$ feet.

Now, we need to find the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the height of the two trees combined. The combined height of the two shorter trees is $s + (s + 5) = 6 + 11 = 17$ feet. Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is $2(17) = 34$ feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the amount of money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount spent on the toys and then subtract that from the total amount he received.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on toy cars: 6 toy cars * $2 = $12
Then, let's calculate the total amount spent on teddy bears: 5 teddy bears * $1 = $5
Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and teddy bears: $12 + $5 = $17

Dean initially received $28 and then received an additional $10, so the total amount he has is $28 + $10 = $38

Now, let's subtract the amount Dean spent from the total amount he has: $38 - $17 = $21

"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and subtract it from her dad's budget.

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

Since Morgan will also be playing, we need to subtract her cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 
To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.83 ≈ 1

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the arcade tokens in the cost per friend. The cost per friend is actually $30 + $5 = $35. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $35 = 1.57

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.57 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $55 - $5 = $50. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$50 / $35 = 1.43

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.43 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the go-karts in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $50 - $20 = $30. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$30 / $35 = 0.86

"To determine the amount of money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate her daily savings and then multiply it by the number of days she saves.

First, let's calculate her daily savings. Marisa receives $5 as pocket money every day and spends $1 on 4 lollipops, each costing $0.25. 

Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Cost of lollipops
Daily savings = $5 - $1
Daily savings = $4

Now, we need to find the total savings over 5 days.

Total savings = Daily savings x Number of days
Total savings = $4 x 5
Total savings = $20

Therefore, Marisa saves $20 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the amount of candy Billy bought, we need to solve a system of equations. Let's denote the amount of candy he bought as 'x' pounds and the amount of money he spent on candy as 'c'. We know that the cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the total cost of the candy is c = 1.5x.

Billy started with $10 and spent c dollars on candy, so the amount of money he had left is 10 - c. He then took half of this amount and spent it on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 \* 0.05 = $2.

We can set up the equation for the amount of money he spent on gumballs as (10 - c) / 2 = 2. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us 10 - c = 4. Subtracting 10 from both sides yields -c = -6, and dividing both sides by -1 gives us c = 6.

Now that we know the amount of money he spent on candy, we can find the amount of candy he bought by substituting c into the equation c = 1.5x. This gives us 6 = 1.5x. Dividing both sides by 1.5 yields x = 4.

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the age of Carver's son, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the son's age as 'x'. According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be expressed as:

2x - 5 = 45

To solve for 'x', we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

2x - 5 + 5 = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to isolate 'x':

(2x) / 2 = 50 / 2
x = 25

Therefore, the age of Carver's son is 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"Given the scenario, we have a train traveling between three cities with specific distances between each city. The distances are as follows:

- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city to the first city: 175 - 50 = 125 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs)

To find the total distance traveled in one trip, we sum the individual distances:
75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is the product of the one-trip distance and the number of trips:
300 miles/trip × 3 trips/day = 900 miles/day

The train requires service every 18,000 miles. To determine the number of days between services, we divide the total distance between services by the daily distance:
18,000 miles ÷ 900 miles/day = 20 days

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount of stuffing needed for Mark's custom dog beds, we need to calculate the amount required for each type of bed and then sum the total.

First, let's find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. Since a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed, we can use the formula for the average of two numbers:

Average = (a + b) / 2

where a = 8 pounds (Rottweiler bed) and b = 2 pounds (chihuahua bed).

Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 

Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To determine the total time taken for John's trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey and then sum them.

The distance to John's friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time taken to drive to friend's house = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.857 hours (approximately).

However, John had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. Therefore, the actual distance to his friend's house is 210 miles. We can recalculate the time taken:

Time taken to drive to friend's house = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

To find the time taken to drive back home, we use the same formula with the given distance of 240 miles and speed of 80 mph:

Time taken to drive back home = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

Now, we can find the total time taken for the trip by summing the times for each leg:

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to drive to friend's house + Time taken to drive back home = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we can use a straightforward approach by first calculating the total number of students present and then subtracting the number of girls from it.

Let's denote the total number of fourth-graders as T, the number of girls as G, the number of absent girls as AG, and the number of absent boys as AB. We are given the following values:

T = 96 (total number of fourth-graders)
G = 43 (number of girls)
AG = 5 (number of absent girls)
AB = 4 (number of absent boys)

First, we calculate the total number of students absent on Friday:
Total absent = AG + AB
Total absent = 5 + 4
Total absent = 9

Next, we find the number of students present on Friday:
Students present = T - Total absent
Students present = 96 - 9
Students present = 87

Now, we can find the number of girls present:
Girls present = G - AG
Girls present = 43 - 5
Girls present = 38

Finally, we can determine the number of boys present by subtracting the number of girls present from the total number of students present:
Boys present = Students present - Girls present
Boys present = 87 - 38
Boys present = 49

The final answer is: $\boxed{49}$"
"Given the problem, we can apply basic arithmetic operations to determine the total number of kids in the park. 

Let's denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B. We are given that G = 6 and B = 2G.

Substituting the given values, we get Total = 6 + 2(6) = 6 + 12 = 18.

Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 18.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we can use a simple subtraction operation. Given that she needs a total of 42 points and has already scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test, we can calculate the remaining points required as follows:

Total required points = 42
Points scored in the first test = 15
Points scored in the second test = 18

Points scored so far = 15 + 18 = 33
Points needed on the third test = Total required points - Points scored so far
= 42 - 33
= 9

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test to meet the minimum requirement.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"Given the scenario, we have three distinct groups of individuals kicked out of the Walmart: those who refused to wear masks, those who were caught shoplifting, and those who engaged in physical violence. Let's denote the number of individuals in each group as M, S, and V, respectively.

We are given that M = 3. The number of individuals caught shoplifting, S, is four times the number of individuals who refused to wear masks minus 5. This can be expressed as:

S = 4M - 5
S = 4(3) - 5
S = 12 - 5
S = 7

Next, we are told that the number of individuals who engaged in physical violence, V, is three times the number of individuals caught shoplifting:

V = 3S
V = 3(7)
V = 21

We are also given that the total number of individuals kicked out is 50. Therefore, the sum of the individuals in each group is equal to 50:

M + S + V + O = 50

where O represents the number of individuals kicked out for other reasons. Substituting the values we have found for M, S, and V, we get:

3 + 7 + 21 + O = 50

Combining the constants on the left-hand side of the equation, we have:

31 + O = 50

Subtracting 31 from both sides of the equation yields:

O = 50 - 31
O = 19

Therefore, the number of individuals kicked out for other reasons is 19.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Erin's points before the given scenario as x.

We are given that Erin now has 14 points and that she has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. This implies that Erin's current points are the sum of her initial points and the points she scored, which is x + 14. We also know that Erin's current points are three times Sara's points, so we can set up the equation:

x + 14 = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 14 = 24

Subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 10

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before the given scenario.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Since each frame costs $20 and there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is given by:

44 \* 20 = 880

Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the picture frames. The etching costs an additional 20% of the cost of each frame, which is 0.20 \* 20 = 4 dollars per frame. Therefore, the total cost of etching is:

44 \* 4 = 176

Now, we add the cost of the picture frames and the etching to get the total cost of the picture frames:

880 + 176 = 1056

In addition to the picture frames, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. The total cost of the pins is:

2 \* 5 = 10

We also need to calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. Since 1/4 of the seniors are officers, we can find the number of officers by multiplying 44 by 1/4:

44 \* 1/4 = 11

Each officer receives a cord that costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is:

11 \* 12 = 132

Finally, we add the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords to get the total cost of the senior gifts:

1056 + 10 + 132 = 1198

The final answer is: $1198"
"To determine the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. This can be calculated as follows:

20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final numerical answer is: $320"
"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

Let's start with the number of shoes sold on Friday: 14 pairs. 

On Saturday, the store sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday.

Total shoes sold on Sunday = 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold:
50 * 2 = 100

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"

- On Thursdays, she had 2 hours of dance practice.
- On Saturdays, she had twice as long as Tuesday's night class, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours: 1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours.

Therefore, Hallie had a total of 5 hours of dance practice per week.

"To calculate the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to determine the value of the faulty pieces and subtract it from the total amount spent.

Given that the total amount spent is $400,000 and the faulty pieces constitute 40% of the total, we can express this as a mathematical equation:

Total Amount Spent = Value of Faulty Pieces + Value of Functioning Pieces

We know that the value of the faulty pieces is 40% of the total amount spent, which can be represented as:

Value of Faulty Pieces = 0.4 × Total Amount Spent
= 0.4 × $400,000
= $160,000

Now, we can solve for the value of the functioning pieces by subtracting the value of the faulty pieces from the total amount spent:

Value of Functioning Pieces = Total Amount Spent - Value of Faulty Pieces
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

Therefore, the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To determine the total milk collected, we need to calculate the milk from half of the sheep and the other half separately and then add them together.

Let's denote the total number of sheep as S, the milk collected from half of the sheep as M1, and the milk collected from the other half as M2. We are given that S = 30.

M1 = (1/2) * S = (1/2) * 30 = 15 kg

M2 = (1/2) * S = (1/2) * 30 = 15 kg

However, we are also given that M2 = 2 * M1. This implies that the milk collected from the other half of the sheep is twice the milk collected from the first half. Therefore, we can express M2 in terms of M1 as M2 = 2 * M1.

Substituting M1 = 15 kg into the equation M2 = 2 * M1, we get M2 = 2 * 15 = 30 kg.

Now, we can find the total milk collected by adding M1 and M2: M_total = M1 + M2 = 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To determine the number of pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we need to calculate the total number of pieces after breaking the remaining rolls into 8 equal parts.

Let's start by identifying the initial number of rolls, which is a dozen, denoted as 12. After feeding her 6 children, the remaining number of rolls can be calculated as follows:

12 (initial rolls) - 6 (rolls fed to children) = 6 (remaining rolls)

Now, we need to find the total number of pieces after breaking each of the remaining rolls into 8 equal parts. This can be calculated using the formula:

Number of pieces = Number of remaining rolls * Number of pieces per roll
= 6 * 8
= 48

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we can break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, we find the number of pupils who like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 40 = 20$ pupils.

Next, we need to find the number of pupils who like green. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, which can be expressed as a fraction: $\frac{1}{4} \cdot (40 - 20) = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 20 = 5$ pupils.

Now, we can find the total number of pupils who like blue and green by adding these two values: $20 + 5 = 25$ pupils.

Finally, to find the number of pupils who like yellow, we subtract the total number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils: $40 - 25 = 15$ pupils.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked on each day.

Let's start with Monday. We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday and received $56 from selling them at $4 per piece. To find the number of apples picked on Monday, we can use the following equation:

Number of apples = Total revenue / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked on each day:

Total apples = 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday)
= 14 + 12 + 24
= 50 apples

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed and subtract that from the total number of socks that need washing.

First, let's calculate the number of socks from the pairs. Since each pair consists of 2 socks, 10 pairs of socks is equivalent to 10 x 2 = 20 socks.

Next, we add the 15 loose socks to the total number of socks from the pairs. This gives us 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Now, we subtract the total number of socks Lindsay has washed from the total number of socks that need washing: 50 - 35 = 15.

Therefore, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"To determine the number of cookies left for Rachel, we need to apply basic arithmetic operations. 

Let's denote the initial number of cookies as C1, the number of cookies Janet gave her as C2, and the number of cookies her brother ate as C3. 

C1 = 23 (initial cookies)
C2 = 42 (cookies from Janet)
C3 = 44 (cookies eaten by brother)

First, we calculate the total number of cookies by adding C1 and C2:
C_total = C1 + C2
C_total = 23 + 42
C_total = 65

Next, we subtract the number of cookies eaten by her brother from the total:
C_left = C_total - C3
C_left = 65 - 44
C_left = 21

Therefore, the number of cookies left for Rachel is 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To calculate the monthly payment, we can use the formula for the total amount to be paid, which is the principal plus the interest. The interest is calculated as the product of the principal, interest rate, and time.

Given:
- Principal (P) = $3,650
- Interest Rate (r) = 10% or 0.10
- Time (t) = 5 months

The total interest (I) is calculated as:
I = P * r * t
I = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
I = $1,825

The total amount to be paid (A) is the sum of the principal and interest:
A = P + I
A = $3,650 + $1,825
A = $5,475

To find the monthly payment (M), we divide the total amount by the number of months (n):
M = A / n
M = $5,475 / 5
M = $1,095

Therefore, Karan must pay $1,095 per month.

The final answer is: $1,095"
"To determine the distance each individual hiked, we can utilize the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time. 

For Cho, the distance hiked is given by $d_{Cho} = 14 \text{ km/h} \times 8 \text{ h} = 112 \text{ km}$.

For Chloe, the distance hiked is given by $d_{Chloe} = 9 \text{ km/h} \times 5 \text{ h} = 45 \text{ km}$.

To find the difference in distance hiked between Cho and Chloe, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance: $d_{Cho} - d_{Chloe} = 112 \text{ km} - 45 \text{ km} = 67 \text{ km}$.

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

The final answer is: $\boxed{67}$"
"To determine the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they possess.

Let's denote the number of silver pesos Axel has as S = 50 and the number of gold pesos he has as G = 80.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so the number of silver pesos she has is 2S = 2 * 50 = 100.

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so the number of gold pesos she has is G + 40 = 80 + 40 = 120.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is S + 2S = 3S = 3 * 50 = 150.

The total number of gold pesos they have together is G + (G + 40) = 2G + 40 = 2 * 80 + 40 = 160 + 40 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is (S + 2S) + (G + (G + 40)) = 3S + 2G + 40 = 3 * 50 + 2 * 80 + 40 = 150 + 160 + 40 = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To determine the profit per hour Millie makes from her lemonade stand, we need to calculate the total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she operates the stand.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she purchased. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 × 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

The revenue from selling all the lemonade is the number of cups sold multiplied by the price per cup, which is $1. Therefore, the total revenue is 36 × $1 = $36.

The cost of the supplies is $18. To find the total profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she can make 36 cups in total, the number of hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade is 36 ÷ 4 = 9 hours.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 ÷ 9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can set up a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can set up the equation:

$$\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8$$

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

$$x = 12.8 \cdot \frac{5}{2}$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$x = 32$$

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"Given that the choir consists of 52 members, with 50% boys and 50% girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 0.5 * 52 = 26

Since the bus breaks down, half of the girls cannot make it to the performance. Therefore, the number of girls who cannot make it is:

Number of girls who cannot make it = 26 / 2 = 13

The total number of girls performing is the difference between the total number of girls and the number of girls who cannot make it:

Number of girls performing = 26 - 13 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. To find the total number of people performing, we add the number of girls performing to the number of teachers:

Total number of people performing = 13 + 3 = 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. This can be achieved by summing the scores and then dividing by the number of scores.

First, we add up all the scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

The sum of the scores is 400. To find the average, we divide this sum by the number of scores, which is 5.

400 ÷ 5 = 80

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

"To determine the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can express this relationship as a fraction.

Let's denote the number of messages to Ms. Thompson as M. Then, the number of messages to Mr. Yu is (1/3)M.

Given that M = 66, we can calculate the number of messages to Mr. Yu as follows:

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3)M
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3)(66)
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can find the total number of messages James delivers by adding the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

Total messages = M + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"To determine the amount of money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Let's denote the cost of one ride as $4, since each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket. Therefore, the total cost for Dasha to ride all 9 rides is 9 * $4 = $36.

On the other hand, David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. This means that David's cost for riding all 9 rides is $30.

To find the amount of money David saves, we subtract the cost of the ride bracelet from the total cost for Dasha: $36 - $30 = $6.

Therefore, David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual ride tickets.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the amount of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts. 

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts: 
6 (family) + 4 (friends) + 2 (teachers) = 12 gifts

Now, let's divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

This is a straightforward division problem, and the result is a constant value. Therefore, the amount of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow is 12 inches.

"Given the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, we can express this as a fraction, 5/11, representing the proportion of popsicles Betty has, and 6/11, representing the proportion of popsicles Sam has. The total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

To find the number of popsicles each person has, we can use the concept of weighted averages. We can set up the equation:

(5/11) * Total Popsicles = Betty's Popsicles
(6/11) * Total Popsicles = Sam's Popsicles

Substituting the given total number of popsicles, we get:

(5/11) * 165 = Betty's Popsicles
(6/11) * 165 = Sam's Popsicles

Simplifying the expressions, we get:

Betty's Popsicles = (5/11) * 165 = 75
Sam's Popsicles = (6/11) * 165 = 90

Now, to find the difference in the number of popsicles between Sam and Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

Difference = Sam's Popsicles - Betty's Popsicles = 90 - 75 = 15

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the amount of money Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services he plans to subscribe to.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus individually is $10 each, but since Tim is bundling them, he receives a 20% discount. 

To find the discount, we calculate 20% of the total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus, which is $10 + $10 = $20. 

20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

The bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

To find the amount of money Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: $60 - $26 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To determine the percentage of time spent editing, we first need to calculate the total time spent on the task. 

The time spent writing the song is 4 hours, the time spent recording is half of that, which is 2 hours, and the time spent editing is 90 minutes, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours.

Total time spent = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we can use the formula:

Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100

Substituting the values, we get:

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 0.5.

Percentage of time spent editing = (3 / 15) * 100

Further simplifying the fraction, we get:

Percentage of time spent editing = (1 / 5) * 100

To convert the fraction to a percentage, we can multiply the numerator by 100 and divide by the denominator.

Percentage of time spent editing = 100 / 5

Percentage of time spent editing = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of books Wendy needs to carry, we must first calculate the number of books in the shelving system. Given that it has 6 rows and 6 columns, we can find the total number of books by multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns.

The total number of books in the shelving system is 6 * 6 = 36.

Next, we need to find double the number of books, which is 2 * 36 = 72.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so we add 20 to the result: 72 + 20 = 92.

Therefore, Wendy needs to carry 92 books to complete her task.

"To determine the total number of Valentine's cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Let's denote the initial number of cards Erica had as E, the number of cards her dad brought as D, the number of cards she passed out as P, and the number of cards she received as R.

Given that Erica initially had 20 Valentine's cards, we can express this as E = 20.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so the number of cards her dad brought is D = 2 * 15 = 30.

The total number of cards Erica had after her dad brought her the cards is E + D = 20 + 30 = 50.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so the total number of cards she passed out is P = 24 + 5 = 29.

The number of cards Erica had after passing out the cards is 50 - 29 = 21.

She received 17 cards from family and friends, so the total number of cards she has now is 21 + 17 = 38.

Therefore, the total number of Valentine's cards Erica has now is 38.

"To determine the number of slices left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices given away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the 12 slices to Bill, which is $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 12 = 4$ slices. Similarly, she gave 1/4 of the 12 slices to Mark, which is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 12 = 3$ slices.

The total number of slices given away is $4 + 3 = 7$ slices.

Jenny also consumed 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away and ate is $7 + 2 = 9$ slices.

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices given away and eaten from the initial number of slices: $12 - 9 = 3$ slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"

This calculation indicates that Mark needs to save for 30 days to accumulate enough money to buy the bike."
"To determine the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Let's start with the number of spiders, which is given as 90. The number of millipedes is 1/3rd of the number of spiders, so we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 90$. To find the value, we multiply the numerator by the denominator and divide by the denominator: $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 90 = \frac{90}{3} = 30$.

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs, which is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. We can express this as an equation: $2 \cdot 30 - 12$. To evaluate this expression, we first multiply 2 by 30, which gives us 60, and then subtract 12: $60 - 12 = 48$.

Now that we have the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs, we can find the total number of bugs by adding these values together: $90 + 30 + 48 = 168$.

1. A = B + 7 (Alice is 7 years older than Beth)
2. B = E + 5 (Beth is 5 years older than Erica)
3. E = 30 (Erica is 30 years old)

Substituting the value of E into equation (2), we get:
B = 30 + 5
B = 35

Now, substituting the value of B into equation (1), we get:
A = 35 + 7
A = 42

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is A - E = 42 - 30 = 12.

"To determine the builder's annual earnings, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a year.

First, let's find the total number of days he works in a year. Since he works 4 weeks every month and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of weeks he works in a year is 4 * 12 = 48 weeks. Given that he works 6 days every week, the total number of days he works in a year is 48 * 6 = 288 days.

Now, let's calculate his daily earnings. He gets paid $50 every day. Therefore, his daily earnings can be represented as:

Daily Earnings = $50

To find his total earnings in a year, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he works in a year:

Total Earnings = Daily Earnings * Number of Days Worked in a Year
Total Earnings = $50 * 288
Total Earnings = $14400

The final answer is: $14400"
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we must first calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the amount of each ingredient by 4.

Total flour required = 3 cups/batch * 4 batches = 12 cups
Total milk required = 1 cup/batch * 4 batches = 4 cups

Given that flour is sold in 2-cup bags and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we can calculate the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy by dividing the total amount of each ingredient by the amount in each container.

Number of bags of flour = Total flour required / Flour in each bag = 12 cups / 2 cups/bag = 6 bags
Number of bottles of milk = Total milk required / Milk in each bottle = 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles

To find the difference between the number of bags of flour and the number of bottles of milk, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour.

Difference = Number of bags of flour - Number of bottles of milk = 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4 bags

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the energy saved by Mel, we first need to calculate the energy used per day by the air conditioner. Given that it uses 900 watts of energy per hour, we can express this as a rate of energy consumption: 900 W.

The time of usage is 8 hours a day, so the energy used per day is calculated as the product of the rate and the time: 900 W * 8 h = 7200 Wh. To convert this to kilowatt-hours (kWh), we divide by 1000, since 1 kWh = 1000 Wh. Therefore, the original energy used per day is 7.2 kWh.

If Mel reduces the usage time by 5 hours, the new time of usage is 8 h - 5 h = 3 h. The energy used per day at the reduced rate is then 900 W * 3 h = 2700 Wh, or 2.7 kWh.

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and reduced energy usage: 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy savings by the number of days: 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

The final numerical answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we need to calculate the total number of stripes and divide it by the total number of zebras.

Let's denote the number of stripes on the first two zebras as 17, the third zebra as 36, and the fourth zebra as x, where x is half the number of stripes on the third zebra. Therefore, x = 36 / 2 = 18.

The total number of stripes is the sum of the stripes on all four zebras: 17 + 17 + 36 + 18 = 88.

The total number of zebras is 4.

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

Therefore, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 22.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese for the muffaletta sandwiches, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people.

Given that each sandwich serves 4 people, we can find the number of sandwiches needed by dividing the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, the total amount of each ingredient needed is equal to the number of sandwiches:

Meat: 5 pounds
Cheese: 5 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese by multiplying the amount of each ingredient by its respective cost per pound:

Meat cost: 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
Cheese cost: 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:

Total cost = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. Let's denote the initial number of cannolis as C and the initial number of corns as 2C, since there are twice as many corns as cannolis.

Given that Allan has 40 cannolis initially, we can set up the equation C = 40.

Now, we know that Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, the number of cannolis he bought is 60, and the number of corns he bought is 60 - 40 = 20.

The total number of cannolis Allan has now is the sum of the initial number of cannolis and the number of cannolis he bought: C + 60 = 40 + 60 = 100.

The total number of corns Allan has now is the sum of the initial number of corns and the number of corns he bought: 2C + 20 = 2(40) + 20 = 100.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 100 = 200.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we can start by calculating the total steps he completed before his jog. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. Therefore, the total steps completed before his jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Now, we know that Elliott had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog. To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we can subtract the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. However, a more efficient approach would be to subtract the steps completed before the jog from the total steps, and then subtract the remaining steps from that result.

Let's calculate the steps taken during the jog: 10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete. Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find the steps taken during the jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the steps left to complete before his jog: 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be at the airport, we need to calculate the total time it takes for him to read the book and travel to the airport.

First, let's calculate the total time it takes to read the book. The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 * 200 = 9000 words. Given that Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute, the time it takes to read the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Next, we need to account for the time it takes to get to the airport, which is 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes for Toby to read the book and travel to the airport is 30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes.

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, we can find out how many minutes early he will be by subtracting the time he arrives from the time he has to be there: 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to determine the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total amount paid in May. The company hired 40 employees, each working 40 hours a week for 4 weeks. The total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. Therefore, the total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

Next, let's calculate the total amount paid in June. Since 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

$168,000"
"To determine the amount of money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

The taffy sale can be broken down into two parts: the first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which is equivalent to 1/2 × $3 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

The cost of the mixed bag of seashells is $1.50, and the 4 magnets cost 4 × $0.25 = $1.

The total cost of the items Sally purchased is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so we can calculate the amount of money she has left by subtracting the total cost from her initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To determine the total amount spent on fireworks, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework, then apply the discount.

Let's denote the cost of the first package of fireworks as $400. The second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * 400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is the sum of the two packages: 400 + 800 = $1200.

To calculate the discount, we need to find 20% of the total cost of the fireworks. This can be expressed as 0.20 * 1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the fireworks is the original cost minus the discount: 1200 - 240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent is the sum of the discounted cost of the fireworks and the cost of the finale firework: 960 + 150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she will consume over 30 days. Given that she eats 2 cookies per night, we can find this by multiplying the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights:

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon's recipe yields 1 dozen (12) cookies, we can find the number of dozens she needs by dividing the total number of cookies by 12:

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

Therefore, Shannon requires 5 dozen cookies to have a 30-day supply.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to consider the intersection of the two conditions.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. This is a subset of the total candles, which is 50000. The probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is 5%, or 0.05. Therefore, the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500.

Next, we need to find the number of candles that are more dangerous and have a 99% guarantee not to explode. This implies that 1% of the candles are more dangerous and can explode. The number of candles that are more dangerous is 0.01 * 50000 = 500.

However, we are interested in the intersection of the two sets: candles that smell like wet dog and are more dangerous. Since 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog, we can find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are more dangerous by multiplying the number of more dangerous candles by the probability of a more dangerous candle smelling like wet dog: 0.05 * 500 = 25.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which can be expressed as 0.3 * $20 = $6.

The discounted price of each blouse is then the regular price minus the discount amount: $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is the product of the discounted price per blouse and the number of blouses: 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Given that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples.

From the shortest trees, Joanne gathers half the amount she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as x. The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.

The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation: 45 + x + 105 = 500.

Now, let's solve for x:

45 + x + 105 = 500
x + 150 = 500
x = 350

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"Given a herd consisting of camels and dromedaries, with a total of 180 heads and 304 bumps, we can establish a system of linear equations to determine the number of dromedaries.

Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. The total number of heads is 180, so we can express this as:

C + D = 180

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps is 304, which can be represented as:

2C + D = 304

To solve for the number of dromedaries, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, the number of dromedaries in the herd is 56.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To calculate the total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days. Since Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is given by the product of the daily distance and the number of days:

$$\text{Distance in first 4 days} = 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}$$

Next, we need to find the distance traveled in the next 2 days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days. To calculate this, we multiply the distance traveled in the first 4 days by 30% (or 0.3):

$$\text{Distance in next 2 days} = 0.3 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km}$$

Since Tom didn't travel on the next day, the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. With 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:

$$\text{Distance in second week} = 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}$$

Now, we can find the total distance traveled by adding up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:

$$\text{Total distance} = 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{3140}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a series of proportional relationships between the sizes of the lockers. Let's denote the size of Timothy's locker as T, Zack's locker as Z, and Peter's locker as P.

We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, and we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. This can be expressed as:

P = (1/4)Z

Since we know P = 5, we can solve for Z:

5 = (1/4)Z
Z = 5 * 4
Z = 20

Now, we are told that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. This can be expressed as:

Z = (1/2)T

Substituting the value of Z we found earlier, we get:

20 = (1/2)T
T = 20 * 2
T = 40

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the elevation where Stanley's comb is located, we need to calculate the difference between Stanley's initial elevation and the distance the comb fell.

Let's denote Stanley's initial elevation as S = 10,000 feet and the distance the comb fell as d = 4,000 feet. The elevation of the comb can be calculated as:

Elevation of the comb = S - d
= 10,000 - 4,000
= 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb. Let's denote Oliver's elevation as O = 3,000 feet. The distance Oliver must climb can be calculated as:

Distance Oliver must climb = Elevation of the comb - O
= 6,000 - 3,000
= 3,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To determine the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to calculate the amount of money he received from the banks and add it to his initial capital.

Let's denote the amount of money Mr. Josue received from the first bank as $B1 = $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, so the amount of money he received from the second bank is $B2 = 2 * $B1 = 2 * $4000 = $8000.

The total amount of money Mr. Josue received from the banks is the sum of $B1 and $B2, which is $B1 + $B2 = $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Now, we can find the total capital Mr. Josue has now by adding the initial capital to the amount he received from the banks: $C = $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"To determine the number of cats left on the rock, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which can be expressed as 4 * 5 = 20 cats. Therefore, the number of cats remaining on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we can multiply 3/5 by 30:

$$\frac{3}{5} \cdot 30 = \frac{3 \cdot 30}{5} = \frac{90}{5} = 18$$

Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran from the remaining cats to find the final number of cats left on the rock:

30 - 18 = 12

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different price periods and calculate the cost for each period.

Let's start by identifying the number of months in 2 years, which is 24 months. We can then calculate the cost for each period:

1. The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is:
\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

2. The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \]

3. The remaining months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months) were $14 a month, so the cost for this period is:
\[ 10 \times 14 = 140 \]

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
\[ 48 + 96 + 140 = 284 \]

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Given the problem, we can approach it by first defining the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. We are given that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so we can express this relationship as J = T - 6.

We also know that the total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and 2/3 from the tattered jeans. This can be represented as (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

To solve for the cost of the tattered jeans, we can substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction yields T - 6 + 2T = 18.

Combining like terms, we get 3T - 6 = 18.

Adding 6 to both sides, we have 3T = 24.

Dividing both sides by 3, we find T = 8.

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans: J = T - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and sum them together.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 × 60 = 240 employees.

The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 × 30 = 180 employees.

The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 × 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570.

The final answer is: $\boxed{570}$"
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

We know that Lillian made 3 homemade feeders and bought 3 store-bought feeders. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted to the homemade and store-bought feeders, which is given by the equation:

Total birds = 3(x + 10) + 3x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Total birds = 3x + 30 + 3x
Total birds = 6x + 30

We are given that each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, and the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. This implies that the store-bought feeders attract 20 birds, and the homemade feeders attract 30 birds. Therefore, we can substitute x = 20 into the equation:

Total birds = 6(20) + 30
Total birds = 120 + 30
Total birds = 150

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of the bagel is given as $4. To find the cost of the soup, we need to calculate 25% of the bagel's cost and add it to the bagel's cost. This can be expressed as:

Soup cost = Bagel cost + (Bagel cost * 0.25)
= $4 + ($4 * 0.25)
= $4 + $1
= $5

The cost of the cake is half the price of the bagel, which can be expressed as:

Cake cost = Bagel cost / 2
= $4 / 2
= $2

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together:

Total cost = Bagel cost + Soup cost + Cake cost
= $4 + $5 + $2
= $11

Therefore, Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.

The final answer is: $11"
"To determine the initial number of Pokémon cards Kenny had, we need to consider the amount of money he has and the price at which he sells the cards. Given that the amusement park ticket costs $100 and he has $50 in spending cash, Kenny needs to make $50 from selling the cards.

Let's denote the price per card as $1.5. The number of cards he sold can be calculated by dividing the amount he needs ($50) by the price per card ($1.5).

$$\text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{\text{Amount needed}}{\text{Price per card}} = \frac{50}{1.5} = 33.33$$

Since Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's denote the total number of cards as x. Then, 2/3 * x = 33.33.

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

$$x = 33.33 \times \frac{3}{2}$$

$$x = 50$$

Therefore, Kenny started with 50 cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog when 40 guests showed up and everyone wanted a second hotdog.

First, let's calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared. The caterer prepared enough for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs, which is 18 guests. This means 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs were prepared for these 18 guests. For the other half of the guests (also 18), the caterer prepared 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs.

In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, when 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog, the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 * 2 = 80.

Since there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, we can find the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog by subtracting the number of hotdogs prepared from the total number of hotdogs needed: 80 - 54 = 26.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we need to calculate the number of letters in her sister's name first.

Let's denote the number of letters in Indras' name as I = 6. 

The number of letters in her sister's name is 4 more than half of the letters in Indras' name. Therefore, the number of letters in her sister's name is (1/2)I + 4.

Substituting I = 6 into the equation, we get (1/2)(6) + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we can find the total number of letters in both names by adding the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name: I + (1/2)I + 4 = 6 + 7 = 13.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

1. The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
2. The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
3. The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total cost of the utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

Total cost before discount = $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00
Total cost before discount = $165.00

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The discount is 20% of the total cost before discount, which can be calculated as follows:

Discount = 0.20 x $165.00
Discount = $33.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost after the discount:

Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount
Total cost after discount = $165.00 - $33.00
Total cost after discount = $132.00

Therefore, the total cost of Charlotte's order after the 20% discount is $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To determine the amount of money Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball, we must first calculate the total cost of the items. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. Therefore, the total cost is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Dora has a total of $18, which is comprised of $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother. To find the amount of money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to establish the number of dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter slew first.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who slew 100 dragons. To find three quarters of 100, we can multiply 100 by 3/4, which is equivalent to 100 * (3/4) = 75.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so we can express this as 2 * 75 = 150.

Now, we need to find one-fifth of the number of dragons Prince Walter slew, which is 150. To do this, we can multiply 150 by 1/5, or equivalently, divide 150 by 5. This gives us 150 / 5 = 30.

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the amount of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how much gas was in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount in each container by dividing 15 by 5.

15 gallons ÷ 5 containers = 3 gallons/container

Now, we need to convert the amount in gallons to pints. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. Therefore, we can convert 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8.

3 gallons × 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints/container

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we can calculate the amount in pints by multiplying 24 pints by 1/4.

24 pints/container × 1/4 = 24 pints/container × 0.25 = 6 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the total amount of money George spent on chips and candy bars. We know that he spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money. 

Let's denote the total amount of money George had initially as $x. Then, 99% of $x is equal to $5. We can express this as:

0.99x = 5

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.99:

x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.0505

Now that we know the initial amount of money George had, we can find the amount he spent on chips. Since he bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, the total cost of the chips is:

3 * 0.40 = 1.20

The amount of money George spent on candy bars is the difference between the initial amount of money he had and the amount he spent on chips:

Money spent on candy bars = x - 1.20
= 5.0505 - 1.20
= 3.8505

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find the number of candy bars George bought by dividing the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

Number of candy bars = Money spent on candy bars / Cost of one candy bar
= 3.8505 / 0.75
= 5.13

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to perform a simple division operation. 

Let's denote the total number of lollipops as T, the number of lollipops Ray kept as K, and the number of friends as F. We are given that T = 25, K = 5, and F = 4.

The number of lollipops shared is T - K = 25 - 5 = 20.

To find the number of lollipops each friend received, we divide the shared lollipops by the number of friends: 20 ÷ 4 = 5.

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we can apply basic principles of division and subtraction. 

First, we need to find the weight of each piece of cake. Since the cake is cut into 8 equal pieces, we can divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces.

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Next, we need to find the total weight of the cake eaten by Rory and her mom. Since each of them has a piece, we can multiply the weight of each piece by 2.

Total weight eaten = 2 * Weight of each piece
Total weight eaten = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

Now, we can find the weight of the remaining cake by subtracting the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of oranges each person will receive, we need to calculate the total number of oranges and then divide it by the total number of people sharing them.

First, let's find the total number of oranges. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Now, we need to find the total number of people sharing the oranges. Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends make a total of 8 people.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

Total oranges ÷ Total people = 56 ÷ 8

Using division, we get:

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Therefore, each person will receive 7 oranges.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

First, let's calculate the cost of the onions. Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, we can calculate the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

Therefore, the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup is $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne to get to the theater first, we need to consider the time it takes for each of them to arrive at the theater.

Let's denote the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater as $t_W$. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, we have $t_W = 4$ minutes.

The time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater is four times as long as the time it takes for Wayne, so we can express it as $t_B = 4t_W$. Substituting the value of $t_W$, we get $t_B = 4 \cdot 4 = 16$ minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we need to find the time she needs to leave before Wayne. Let's denote the time Bernadette needs to leave as $t_L$. The time Bernadette arrives at the theater is $t_B - t_L$, and this should be equal to $t_W - 5$ (since Bernadette arrives 5 minutes before Wayne).

We can set up the equation: $t_B - t_L = t_W - 5$. Substituting the values of $t_B$ and $t_W$, we get $16 - t_L = 4 - 5$. Simplifying the equation, we get $16 - t_L = -1$.

Solving for $t_L$, we get $t_L = 16 + 1 = 17$ minutes. This means Bernadette needs to leave 17 minutes before Wayne.

However, since we want to find how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to subtract the time Wayne leaves from the time Bernadette leaves. Since we don't know the time Wayne leaves, we can express the time Bernadette leaves as $t_L = 17$ minutes before Wayne leaves. Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes before Wayne.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"Given the area of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 360 square feet and the length of his room is 3 yards, we need to find the perimeter of the room in feet. 

First, we convert the length from yards to feet, as 1 yard equals 3 feet. Therefore, 3 yards is equivalent to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
\[ A = l \times w \]
where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width:
\[ w = \frac{A}{l} \]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[ w = \frac{360}{9} \]
\[ w = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (l + w) \]
Substituting the values, we get:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 49 \]
\[ P = 98 \text{ feet} \]

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we need to calculate the total number of beads each has.

Let's denote the number of beads Elizabeth has as E and the number of beads Margareth has as M. Since each pack of beads contains 20 pieces, we can express the total number of beads each sister has as follows:

E = (1 pack of red beads) + (2 packs of clear beads)
E = 1 × 20 + 2 × 20
E = 20 + 40
E = 60

M = (3 packs of blue beads) + (4 packs of red beads)
M = 3 × 20 + 4 × 20
M = 60 + 80
M = 140

Now, we can find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
M - E = 140 - 60
M - E = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to consider the temperature changes due to the oven and the open window.

The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. This can be represented as a linear function, where the temperature increase is directly proportional to the time the oven is on. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

ΔT_oven = 5 * t_oven

where ΔT_oven is the temperature increase due to the oven and t_oven is the time the oven is on in hours.

Given that the oven is on for 3 hours, we can calculate the temperature increase as follows:

ΔT_oven = 5 * 3 = 15 degrees

Next, we need to consider the temperature decrease due to the open window. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours, we can calculate the temperature decrease as follows:

ΔT_window = -2 * (30/10) = -6 degrees

The negative sign indicates a decrease in temperature.

Now, we can calculate the final temperature of the house by adding the temperature increase due to the oven and subtracting the temperature decrease due to the open window from the initial temperature:

T_final = T_initial + ΔT_oven + ΔT_window
= 40 + 15 - 6
= 49 degrees

Therefore, the final temperature of the house is 49 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{49}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total time it took James to complete the triathlon. We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Let's denote the time it took James to swim as S, the time to bike as B, and the time to run as R. We are given that James' swim time is 10% faster than Jon's, so S = 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes. We are also given that James' bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, so B = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

We can now set up an equation to represent the total time it took James to complete the triathlon: S + B + R = 180. Substituting the values we found, we get 36 + 85 + R = 180.

To find R, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtracting 121 from both sides, we get R = 180 - 121.

R = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{59}$"
"To determine the length of Movie A, we need to establish a clear sequence of calculations. 

First, we know that Movie C is 1.25 hours. To convert this to minutes, we apply the conversion factor: 1 hour = 60 minutes. Therefore, Movie C is 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Next, we are informed that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. This implies that Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Now, we are given that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide the length of Movie B by 4: 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

Therefore, the length of Movie A is 20 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount of change Michael has after buying hay for his horse, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the total amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs. Given that the horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is equivalent to 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Using the formula Distance = Speed * Time, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she has and then divide that by the number of eggs required per glass, and finally divide by the number of glasses per tray.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs. Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs in cases, which is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Additionally, she has 2 loose eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many glasses Rozanne can make with 50 eggs. Since each glass requires 5 eggs, the total number of glasses is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Now, we know that each tray holds 5 glasses. To find the number of trays, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses per tray: 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the difference in points between Joey and Marcy after their turns, we need to calculate their respective scores.

Joey's initial points: 214
Points scored by Joey: 26
Joey's total points after his turn: 214 + 26 = 240

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points scored by Marcy: 10
Marcy's total points after her turn: 225 + 10 = 235

Now, we can find the difference between their scores by subtracting Marcy's total points from Joey's total points.

Difference: 240 - 235 = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to determine the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is given by the product of the number of sneakers sold and the price per sneaker:

$$\text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340$$

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:
There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and they were sold for $25 each. The revenue from the department store sale is given by the product of the number of sneakers sold and the price per sneaker:

$$\text{Revenue from department store sale} = 31 \times 25 = 775$$

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale:

$$\text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115$$

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:

$$\text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539$$

The final answer is: $539"
"To determine the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each and the four packets with 16 pieces each.

Let's start by calculating the number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each: 6 × 8 = 48.

Next, we calculate the number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each: 4 × 16 = 64.

Now, we add the number of crayons in both types of packets to find the total: 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, Beatrice bought a total of 112 crayons.

The final answer is: 112"
"Given the scenario, let's analyze the situation using mathematical equations.

Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as $p and the regular price of the soda as $s. We are given that the soda costs $3, so s = 3.

We are also given that the super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra. This means that the cost of the super ticket is the sum of the regular ticket price, the cost of the soda, and the cost of the popcorn, minus the $1 discount. However, we can also express this as the cost of the super ticket being equal to the cost of the regular ticket plus the cost of the soda and the popcorn, minus the $1 discount.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

20 = 12 + s + p - 1

We are also given that if you buy a regular ticket and don't buy the super ticket, you save $2. This means that the cost of the regular ticket plus the cost of the soda and the popcorn is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

12 + s + p = 20 - 2

Substituting the value of s = 3 into the equation, we get:

12 + 3 + p = 18

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15 + p = 18

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get:

p = 3

The final answer is: $3"
"To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. The total cost of filling 20 balloons is $900, so we can set up the equation 20x = 900.

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: x = 900 / 20 = 45.

This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45. Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65.

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. We can calculate this by multiplying the new cost of filling one balloon by 170: 65 × 170 = 11050.

The final answer is: 11050"
"To determine the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours is given by the formula:

Distance1 = Speed1 x Time1
Distance1 = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance1 = 120 miles

The distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour is given by the formula:

Distance2 = Speed2 x Time2
Distance2 = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance2 = 30 miles

The total distance traveled is the sum of Distance1 and Distance2:

Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of Time1 and Time2:

Total Time = Time1 + Time2
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour
Total Time = 3 hours

The average speed is given by the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

Therefore, the average speed of the car during the trip is 50 mph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Let's denote the initial number of sapphires as S = 8 and the initial number of rubies as R = 0. Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so the new number of sapphires is S' = S - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5, and the new number of rubies is R' = R + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2.

The value of a single sapphire is $800, and the value of a single ruby is $1200. Therefore, the total value of the sapphires is 5 * $800 = $4000, and the total value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of Jenna's jewels is the sum of the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To determine the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can apply the concept of arithmetic sequences. Since they each consume 4 apples per day, their combined daily consumption is 4 + 4 = 8 apples.

Now, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the total number of apples consumed over 30 days:

S = n/2 * (a1 + an)

where S is the sum of the series, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, n = 30 (number of days), a1 = 8 (initial consumption), and an = 8 (final consumption).

S = 30/2 * (8 + 8)
S = 15 * 16
S = 240

Therefore, Marin and Nancy consume a total of 240 apples in 30 days.

The final answer is: 240"
"To determine the cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The dimensions of each bed are given as 2 feet in width, 8 feet in length, and 2 feet in height. 

The volume of a rectangular prism, such as a raised bed, is calculated using the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. 

Substituting the given values, we get V = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 10 * 32 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags required is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

The cost of each bag is $12, so the total cost is 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To determine the total number of cards, we need to calculate the number of green cards first. Given that there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can express this as an equation:

Number of green cards = 15 + 0.6(15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
= 39

The total number of cards is the sum of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

Therefore, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 78.

The final answer is: $\boxed{78}$"
"To determine the number of fairies remaining, we can break down the sequence of events.

Initially, Katelyn observed 50 fairies. 

Twenty minutes later, her friend witnessed half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the existing group. This can be expressed as 50/2 = 25 fairies joining the group.

The total number of fairies at this point is the sum of the initial fairies and the new fairies: 50 + 25 = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. To find the number of fairies remaining, we subtract the number of fairies that flew away from the total: 75 - 30 = 45.

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is 45.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To determine the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to calculate the total number of puppies and the number of puppies with spots.

Let's denote the total number of Jennifer's puppies as J and the total number of Brandon's puppies as B. We are given that J = 8 and B = 12.

The total number of puppies is the sum of J and B, which is J + B = 8 + 12 = 20.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Let's denote the number of puppies with spots from Jennifer's dog as S_J and the number of puppies with spots from Brandon's dog as S_B. We are given that S_J = 3 and S_B = 4.

The total number of puppies with spots is the sum of S_J and S_B, which is S_J + S_B = 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (S_J + S_B) / (J + B) * 100
= (7) / (20) * 100
= 35%

Therefore, the percentage of puppies with spots is 35%.

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make to transport the feed, we must first calculate the total weight of the feed. 

The weight of the sugar cubes is 2 pounds, the carrots weigh 48 pounds, the hay weighs 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds, and the oats weigh 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds. 

The total weight of the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we can calculate the number of trips by dividing the total weight by the truck's capacity:

$$\frac{3400}{2250} = 1.511\overline{11}$$

Since we cannot make a fraction of a trip, we must round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the farmer needs to make $\boxed{2}$ trips to transport all the feed."
"To determine Grayson's monthly earnings from recycling, we need to calculate the total value of the cans and bottles she recycles in a month.

First, let's find the total value of the cans and bottles she recycles in a week:

Aluminum cans: 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week
Plastic bottles: 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total earnings per week: 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the total earnings in a month by multiplying the weekly earnings by 4:

Total earnings per month = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month

Therefore, Grayson earns 84 cents per month from recycling.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the number of plants Shondra has, we need to establish the relationship between the number of plants each person possesses. 

Let's start by identifying the number of plants Frederick has, which is given as 10. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can express this as an equation:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Therefore, we can express this as:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the amount Ali has now, we need to calculate the amount Leila gave him and add it to the amount he already had.

Let's denote the amount Leila gave Ali as L. Since Leila gave Ali half of her $100, we can express this as L = 100 / 2.

Using basic arithmetic operations, we can simplify this expression to L = 50.

Now, we need to add the amount Leila gave Ali (L) to the amount Ali already had (A). The total amount Ali has now is A + L = 21 + 50.

Performing the addition, we get A + L = 71.

"To determine the number of students Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she has and then divide that by the number of cards each student receives.

First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards. Since Miss Maria has 6 decks with 25 cards in each deck, we can express this as a multiplication problem: 6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 6 * 25 = 150 cards.

Next, we calculate the total number of baseball cards. With 5 boxes containing 40 cards each, we can express this as another multiplication problem: 5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 5 * 40 = 200 cards.

Now, we add the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards to find the overall number of cards: 150 (basketball cards) + 200 (baseball cards) = 350 cards.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, we subtract this from the total number of cards to find the number of cards she gives to her students: 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

Finally, we divide the number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student receives to find the number of students: 300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students.

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students.

"To determine the difference in the amount Kelly paid compared to Becky, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples for each individual and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate Becky's total cost. The cost per apple is $0.45, and she bought 20 apples. 

Becky's total cost = 20 * $0.45
Becky's total cost = $9

Becky received a $1 discount, which is equivalent to $0.10 (since $1 = $0.10). 

Becky's final cost = $9 - $0.10
Becky's final cost = $8.90

Next, let's calculate Kelly's total cost. The cost per apple is $0.50, and she bought 20 apples. 

Kelly's total cost = 20 * $0.50
Kelly's total cost = $10

Kelly received a 10% discount on her total cost. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.10.

Kelly's discount = $10 * 0.10
Kelly's discount = $1

Kelly's final cost = $10 - $1
Kelly's final cost = $9

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount Kelly paid compared to Becky.

Difference = Kelly's final cost - Becky's final cost
Difference = $9 - $8.90
Difference = $0.10

Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, we can find the total number of cupcakes by multiplying the number of jars by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate.

Total cupcakes = 6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Now, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she needs to bake to have at least 48 cupcakes. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we can divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per pan.

Number of pans = Total cupcakes / Cupcakes per pan
= 48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan
= 4 pans

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes."
"Given that Theo purchased a pen for $2 and a piece of paper that cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen, we can calculate the cost of the paper as follows:

Let's denote the price of the pen as P. The cost of the paper is given by 3P - 1.

We know that P = $2. Therefore, the cost of the paper is 3(2) - 1 = 6 - 1 = $5.

The total cost of the pen and the paper is P + (3P - 1) = 2 + 5 = $7.

Since Theo gave the cashier $10, the change she received is 10 - 7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we'll employ basic arithmetic operations and fractions to determine the number of pencils left at the end of the year.

First, we calculate the total number of pencils initially in the class. Since there are 30 students, each with 10 pencils, the total pencils initially can be expressed as:

Total pencils initially = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

Next, we find the number of pencils used after two months. Given that 1/5 of the total pencils were used, we can calculate this as:

Pencils used = (1/5) * 300 = 60 pencils

Now, we determine the remaining pencils after two months by subtracting the used pencils from the initial total:

Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils

Finally, we calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year, which is 1/3 of the remaining pencils:

Pencils left = (1/3) * 240 = 80 pencils

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, the number of carrot sticks Matt has to eat is 6."
"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras, we need to calculate the ratio of the combined length of the remoras to the length of the shark.

First, let's convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet, as the shark's length is given in feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the length of each remora in feet is 6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet. With two remoras, the combined length is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras:

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras occupies 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Given that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home, we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{3}{4}x$, where x represents the total number of students. Conversely, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{4}x$. We are given that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, so we can set up the equation:

$$\frac{1}{4}x = 20$$

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate x:

$$x = 20 \cdot 4$$

$$x = 80$$

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80."
"To determine how many days Jason has to walk in total to break in his new shoes, we need to calculate the total number of days he has available in three weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply 3 weeks by 7 days/week.

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

However, Jason can only walk 4 days a week. To find out how many days he has to walk in total, we need to divide the total number of days by the number of days he can walk per week.

21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4

"To determine the number of books each child received, we can employ a straightforward division operation. 

Given that Sarah spent $300 on books, with each book costing $15, we can calculate the total number of books purchased as follows:

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah distributed the books equally among her 4 children, we can find the number of books each child received by dividing the total number of books by 4:

Number of books each child got = Total number of books / 4
Number of books each child got = 20 / 4
Number of books each child got = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of kids in Gina's class who aren't allergic to anything, we can utilize the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle allows us to find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts by adding the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number allergic to peanuts, then subtracting the number allergic to both to avoid double-counting.

Let's denote:
- D as the set of kids allergic to dairy
- P as the set of kids allergic to peanuts
- |D| as the number of kids allergic to dairy (9)
- |P| as the number of kids allergic to peanuts (6)
- |D ∩ P| as the number of kids allergic to both (3)

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can calculate the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts as follows:

|D ∪ P| = |D| + |P| - |D ∩ P|
|D ∪ P| = 9 + 6 - 3
|D ∪ P| = 12

Now, to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class:

Total kids = 32
Kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = |D ∪ P| = 12
Kids not allergic to anything = Total kids - Kids allergic to dairy or peanuts
Kids not allergic to anything = 32 - 12
Kids not allergic to anything = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and add the number of tour guides.

First, we calculate the total number of employees by multiplying the number of groups by the number of employees per group: 3 groups * 200 employees/group = 600 employees.

Next, we calculate the total number of tour guides by multiplying the number of groups by the number of tour guides per group: 3 groups * 7 tour guides/group = 21 tour guides.

Now, we add the total number of employees and tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour: 600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621 people.

The final answer is: 621"
"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to consider the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the new price, we calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.20 * $1500 = $300. Adding this to the normal price, we get $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"
"To determine the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he possesses.

Let's denote the number of tubes of blue paint Ben has as B. We are given that Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so the number of tubes of blue paint Jasper has is B/2.

We are also given that Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. Since Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, Jasper has 3B tubes of yellow paint.

We are given that Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint. Therefore, B = 4. Substituting this value into the expressions for the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint Jasper has, we get:

Number of tubes of blue paint Jasper has: B/2 = 4/2 = 2
Number of tubes of yellow paint Jasper has: 3B = 3 * 4 = 12

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he has: 2 + 12 = 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Given that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can express this relationship as a mathematical equation. Let's denote the weight of the 1959 penny as $w_{1959}$ and the weight of the 2010 penny as $w_{2010}$. We are given that $w_{1959} = 48$ grains.

The relationship between the two weights can be expressed as:

$$w_{2010} = \frac{3}{4}w_{1959}$$

Substituting the given value of $w_{1959}$, we get:

$$w_{2010} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48$$

Simplifying the expression, we have:

$$w_{2010} = 36$$

Now, to find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add their individual weights:

$$w_{\text{combined}} = w_{1959} + w_{2010}$$

Substituting the values, we get:

$$w_{\text{combined}} = 48 + 36$$

Evaluating the expression, we find:

$$w_{\text{combined}} = 84$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the amount Keegan and Tasha need to earn to reach their goal, we can calculate the difference between their target and the total amount they have already earned.

Let's denote the target amount as T = $200 and the total amount earned as E = $83 + $91 = $174.

The amount needed to reach the goal is given by the expression: T - E = $200 - $174 = $26.

Therefore, Keegan and Tasha need to earn an additional $26 to reach their goal.

"To determine the difference in the number of songs Luri and Gabriel can add to their respective players, we first need to calculate the number of songs each can add. 

Let's denote the capacity of the portable media player as C = 100 songs. Gabriel currently has 20 songs, so the number of songs he can add is C - 20 = 100 - 20 = 80.

Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so the number of songs Luri has is 3 * 20 = 60. Therefore, the number of songs Luri can add is C - 60 = 100 - 60 = 40.

The difference in the number of songs Luri and Gabriel can add is 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to calculate the number of oranges he ate and then multiply it by the amount he gave up per orange.

Given that they picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them, we can calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

(2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 oranges.

Now, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange, which is $10.

24 oranges * $10/orange = $240.

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"Given that Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes, and her shoes cost $80, we can express this relationship as an equation.

Let's denote the cost of the handbag as 'x'. We know that the cost of the shoes is $80, and the handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of the shoes. This can be represented as:

x = 3(80) - 20

To find the value of 'x', we first calculate 3 times the cost of the shoes:

3(80) = 240

Now, we subtract $20 from this result to find the cost of the handbag:

x = 240 - 20
x = 220

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total hours James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he covers in a week and then divide it by his speed.

Given that James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

Total distance = Distance per day × Number of days
= 12 miles/day × 5 days/week
= 60 miles/week

Now, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total distance by his speed of 10 miles per hour:

Total hours = Total distance ÷ Speed
= 60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour
= 6 hours/week

Therefore, James runs 6 hours a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we must first calculate the total amount of oats consumed by his horses in a day. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day. Therefore, the daily consumption per horse is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find the total consumption for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to determine how many 50-pound bags of oats are required to meet this total consumption. We can do this by dividing the total consumption by the weight of each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of girl Pomeranians, we first need to find the total number of Pomeranians. Given that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can express this as a fraction:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) × 27

To calculate this, we can multiply the numerator (2) by 27 and then divide by the denominator (3):

Pomeranians = (2 × 27) / 3
Pomeranians = 54 / 3
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can express this as a fraction:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) × 18

To calculate this, we can multiply the numerator (1) by 18 and then divide by the denominator (3):

Girl Pomeranians = (1 × 18) / 3
Girl Pomeranians = 18 / 3
Girl Pomeranians = 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To calculate the average highest temperature of the three countries, we need to find the arithmetic mean of the given temperatures. The formula for the arithmetic mean is:

$$\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of values}}{\text{Number of values}}$$

Given the temperatures in Southlandia (-48°F), Northlandia (21°F), and Midlandia (-3°F), we can calculate the sum of the values:

$$\text{Sum of values} = -48 + 21 - 3 = -30$$

Now, we divide the sum by the number of values, which is 3:

$$\text{Average} = \frac{-30}{3} = -10$$

Therefore, the average highest temperature of the three countries is -10°F."
"To determine the number of days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the remaining amount first.

The total cost of the toy car is $12, and the child already has $4 in savings. Therefore, the remaining amount is:

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we can calculate the number of days it will take to save the remaining amount by dividing the remaining amount by the daily savings.

Daily savings = $2

Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Number of days = $8 / $2
Number of days = 4

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of eggs that Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to calculate the total capacity of the trays and subtract that from the total number of eggs he has.

The capacity of each tray is 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays. Therefore, the total capacity of the trays is:

24 eggs/tray * 2 trays = 48 eggs

Now, we subtract the total capacity from the total number of eggs Jaime has:

64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

This means that Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total amount Sally spent on pizzas, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we can express this relationship as a multiplication operation.

Let's denote the cost of the small pizza as $8. The cost of the family-size pizza can be calculated as follows:

Cost of family-size pizza = 3 × Cost of small pizza
= 3 × $8
= $24

Now, we can find the total amount spent by adding the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza:

Total amount spent = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza
= $8 + $24
= $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To determine the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Given that the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors, which costs $4.00. However, since she is purchasing 2 packs, we need to consider the total cost of 2 packs, which is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so we subtract this from the total cost: $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors: $\frac{\$6.00}{8} = \$0.75$.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $\$0.75 \times 100 = 75$ cents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

Let's start by calculating the height of the bottom level, which consists of 4 girls, each 64"" tall. The total height of this level is 4 * 64 = 256"".

Next, we calculate the height of the second level, which consists of 3 girls, each 64"" tall. The total height of this level is 3 * 64 = 192"".

Then, we calculate the height of the third level, which consists of 2 girls, each 64"" tall. The total height of this level is 2 * 64 = 128"".

Finally, we add the height of the shortest girl, who is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 

536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44.67}$"
"To determine the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she walked in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma walks 5 minutes every hour. Since she works 8 hours a day, we can calculate the total number of minutes she walked in a day as follows:

Total minutes walked per day = 5 minutes/hour * 8 hours/day = 5 * 8 = 40 minutes/day

Now, we need to find the total number of minutes she walked in 5 days. We can do this by multiplying the total minutes walked per day by the number of days:

Total minutes walked in 5 days = 40 minutes/day * 5 days = 40 * 5 = 200 minutes

Therefore, the total number of minutes Charisma walked in 5 days is 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote Angela's current age as A and Brett's current age as B. We are given that Brett is 14 years old, so B = 14.

The problem states that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. This can be represented as:

A + 4 = 3(B)

Substituting B = 14 into the equation, we get:

A + 4 = 3(14)

Expanding the equation, we get:

A + 4 = 42

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation, we get:

A = 38

Therefore, Angela's current age is 38 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{38}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides can be calculated as follows:

Morning rides cost = 14 days * $6 per day
Morning rides cost = 14 * 6
Morning rides cost = 84

The cost of the afternoon rides can be calculated as follows:

Afternoon rides cost = 14 days * $2 per day
Afternoon rides cost = 14 * 2
Afternoon rides cost = 28

The total cost is the sum of the morning rides cost and the afternoon rides cost:

Total cost = Morning rides cost + Afternoon rides cost
Total cost = 84 + 28
Total cost = 112

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is $112.

The final answer is: $112"
"To determine the number of Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have and then divide that by the number of oranges required for one pie.

Let's start by calculating the number of oranges Ashley brought. Since she has 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, we can express this as 5 × 10 = 50 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought. It is given that she brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so we can express this as 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

To find the total number of oranges they have, we add the number of oranges Ashley and Brianne brought: 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie requires 3 oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges required for one pie: 120 ÷ 3 = 40 pies.

Therefore, the number of Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make is 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. The cost of the first venue is a flat fee of $200 plus an additional $5 per guest for food, resulting in a total cost of $200 + $5x. The cost of the second venue is a per-person charge of $25, which includes the cost of food.

We can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable. Subtract 5x from both sides of the equation:

200 = 20x

Now, divide both sides by 20:

x = 200 / 20

x = 10

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7.

The total number of insects collected by all three is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: B + B = 2B, and 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the equation becomes:

2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we need to calculate the yards used by each of them separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the yards used by Mariah. Since she used 1/4 of a skein, we can express this as a fraction of the total yards in a skein:

$$\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91$$

Next, let's calculate the yards used by her grandma. She used 1/2 of a skein, which can be expressed as:

$$\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182$$

Now, we can add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together to find the total yards used:

$$91 + 182 = 273$$

Therefore, the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma is 273.

The final answer is: $\boxed{273}$"
"To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total number of gifts for the friends who want 5 gifts each. This is a simple multiplication problem: 2 friends * 5 gifts = 2 × 5 = 10 gifts.

Next, we calculate the total number of gifts for the friends who want 2 gifts each. This is another multiplication problem: 3 friends * 2 gifts = 3 × 2 = 6 gifts.

Now, we add the number of gifts for both groups of friends: 10 gifts + 6 gifts = 16 gifts.

Finally, we add the 10 random gifts Cherrie bought to get the total number of gifts: 16 gifts + 10 gifts = 26 gifts.

The total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"Given the problem, we can break it down into a series of mathematical operations to find the length of the couch.

Let's denote the width of the chair as 'c'. We are given that the chair is 3 feet wide, so c = 3.

The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so its width can be expressed as c + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

Now, we need to find the length of the couch, which is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * (c + 5) = 2 * 8 = 16 feet.

The length of the couch is 2 feet longer than this, so the couch's length = 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"Given the scenario, we can set up an equation to represent the total cost of the gum packs. Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x.

The cost of the grape gum is $2, and the cost of the green apple gum is half of that, which is $1. Therefore, the total cost of all the gum packs is 2x + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2x.

We are given that the total cost is $7. So, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x = 7.

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, 2x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2, x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the optimal lumber purchase for Frederick's popsicle sticks, we need to calculate the cost per unit of sticks for each type of wood. 

Let's denote the number of sticks obtained from a 2 x 4 piece of wood as S1 and the number of sticks obtained from a 2 x 8 piece of wood as S2. The cost of a 2 x 4 piece of wood is C1 = $4, and the cost of a 2 x 8 piece of wood is C2 = $6.

Given that a 2 x 4 piece of wood yields S1 = 200 sticks and a 2 x 8 piece of wood yields S2 = 400 sticks, we can calculate the cost per unit of sticks for each type of wood as follows:

Cost per unit of sticks for 2 x 4 = C1 / S1 = 4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick
Cost per unit of sticks for 2 x 8 = C2 / S2 = 6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick

Since the cost per unit of sticks for the 2 x 8 piece of wood ($0.015) is less than the cost per unit of sticks for the 2 x 4 piece of wood ($0.02), the 2 x 8 piece of wood is the more cost-effective option.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24 budget: 24 / 6 = 4.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces of wood will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

The final answer is: 1600"
"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's sled dogs, we need to calculate the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00, so the total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To determine the weekly cost of bus trips for Janet, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the cost of a single bus trip by the number of trips she takes in a week.

Let's denote the cost of a single bus trip as $2.20 and the number of trips in a week as 5.

Weekly cost of bus trips = Cost of a single bus trip × Number of trips in a week
= $2.20 × 5
= $11.00

Now, we need to find the amount Janet would save by purchasing a weekly bus pass for $20.

Weekly bus pass cost = $20
Weekly bus trip cost = $11.00

Amount saved = Weekly bus pass cost - Weekly bus trip cost
= $20 - $11.00
= $9.00

Therefore, Janet would save $9.00 by buying a weekly bus pass for $20.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Given the problem, we can establish the following relationships between the farm and the zoo:

Let F represent the number of cows at the farm, and Z represent the number of sheep at the zoo. We are given the following information:

1. The farm has 30 cows, so F = 30.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep, so Z = 20.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so Z = 2F.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so F = (1/2)Z.

From the first and third points, we can determine the number of cows at the zoo: Z = 2F = 2(30) = 60.

From the second and fourth points, we can determine the number of sheep at the farm: F = (1/2)Z = (1/2)(20) = 10.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo:

Farm: F = 30 (cows) + 10 (sheep) = 40 animals
Zoo: Z = 60 (cows) + 20 (sheep) = 80 animals

Total number of animals: 40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's analyze the problem. We are given that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. If Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'.

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can write the equation as:
x + y = 4(x + y)

However, this equation is not necessary to solve the problem. We can directly use the information that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, so we can write the equation as:
12 = 4x
4 = 4y

Simplifying the equations:
x = 3
y = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit required for Andy to reach his weight loss goal, we first need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose the weight. 

Let's break down the time frame: from December 31st to July 19th. December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days.

Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 

$$\frac{105,000}{171} \approx 613.5$$

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 613.5 calories.

The final answer is: $\boxed{614}$"
"To determine Gerald's remaining balance, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald's daily earnings are $30. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate his total earnings using the formula:

Total Earnings = Daily Earnings × Number of Days
Total Earnings = $30 × 7
Total Earnings = $210

Now, we subtract the amount Gerald spent from his total earnings to find his remaining balance:

Remaining Balance = Total Earnings - Amount Spent
Remaining Balance = $210 - $100
Remaining Balance = $110

"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total distance she will run. Given that each lap is 0.25 km and she is required to run 8 laps, we can use the formula for the total distance:

Total Distance = Number of Laps × Distance per Lap
Total Distance = 8 laps × 0.25 km/lap
Total Distance = 2 km

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink by multiplying the total distance by the amount of water she needs to drink per kilometer:

Total Water = Total Distance × Water per Kilometer
Total Water = 2 km × 60 ml/km
Total Water = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 120 milliliters of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the amount of money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's calculate the amount spent on clothes. Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. This can be expressed as:

$500 \times 0.20 = $100

The remaining money after buying clothes is:

$500 - $100 = $400

Next, we need to calculate the amount spent on CDs. Julie spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs. This can be expressed as:

$400 \times 0.25 = $100

The remaining money after buying CDs is:

$400 - $100 = $300

"Given that the total cost of a house and a lot is $120,000, and the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can express this relationship as an equation.

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combining like terms, we get 4x = 120,000.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000.

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can calculate the cost of the house as 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To calculate the profit earned by Tara on her canvas bags, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Tara purchased 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. The total number of bags is the product of the number of packs and the number of bags per pack, which is 8 * 5 = 40 bags. The total cost is then the product of the total number of bags and the cost per bag, which is 40 * $4 = $160.

Next, we calculate the total revenue. Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue is the product of the total number of bags and the selling price per bag, which is 40 * $8 = $320.

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: profit = $320 - $160 = $160.

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into manageable steps.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. We can express this as:

Total money = (4 * $10) + (6 * $20)
Total money = $40 + $120
Total money = $160

Now, let's determine the amount of money Ali gives to his sister. Since he gives her half of the total money, we can calculate this as:

Money given to sister = (1/2) * Total money
Money given to sister = (1/2) * $160
Money given to sister = $80

After giving his sister half of the money, Ali has:

Money left = Total money - Money given to sister
Money left = $160 - $80
Money left = $80

Next, we need to find out how much money Ali uses to buy dinner. He uses 3/5 of the remaining money, which can be calculated as:

Money used for dinner = (3/5) * Money left
Money used for dinner = (3/5) * $80
Money used for dinner = $48

Finally, we can determine the amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner:

Money left after dinner = Money left - Money used for dinner
Money left after dinner = $80 - $48
Money left after dinner = $32

"To determine the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then subtract that from the total number of problems.

Let's start by calculating the number of problems Chris completed on Tuesday. Since he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, we can express this as 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

The total number of problems completed by Tuesday is the sum of the problems completed on Monday and Tuesday, which is 12 + 36 = 48.

Now, we need to find the number of problems remaining after Tuesday. The total number of problems Chris has to complete is 100. Therefore, the number of problems remaining after Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52.

Next, we need to calculate the number of problems Chris completed on Wednesday. He completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

The total number of problems completed by Wednesday is the sum of the problems completed on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, which is 12 + 36 + 13 = 61.

Finally, we can find the number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday by subtracting the total number of problems completed by Wednesday from the total number of problems: 100 - 61 = 39.

The final answer is: $\boxed{39}$"
"To determine the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate their individual hourly strawberry-picking rates and then sum them.

Let's denote the number of quarts Tony can pick per hour as T. We are given that Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby's rate is T - 1. Kathy's rate is twice that of Bobby's, which is 2(T - 1). Ricky's rate is two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy's, so it is 2(T - 1) - 2.

Given that Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour, we can substitute T = 6 into the expressions for the other rates:

Bobby's rate = 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour
Kathy's rate = 2(6 - 1) = 10 quarts per hour
Ricky's rate = 2(6 - 1) - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour

Now, we can sum the individual rates to find the total number of quarts they can pick per hour:
T + (T - 1) + 2(T - 1) + (2(T - 1) - 2) = 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread left, we need to apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total number of loaves sold: 93 (morning sales) + 39 (afternoon sales) = 132 loaves.

Next, we subtract the total number of loaves sold and the number of loaves returned from the initial number of loaves baked: 200 (initial loaves) - 132 (total sales) - 6 (returned loaves) = 62 loaves.

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread left is 62."
"To determine the number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant, we need to calculate the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips separately and then sum them.

Let's start with the red tulips. We know that Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row. To find the number of rows of red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips per row.

Number of red tulips = 36
Number of tulips per row = 6
Number of rows of red tulips = 36 ÷ 6 = 6

Next, we'll calculate the number of rows of blue tulips. We know that Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in a row. To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips per row.

Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of tulips per row = 8
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 ÷ 8 = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips.

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins required for each batch of cookies.

Let's start by finding the total number of cups of raisins available for the oatmeal cookies. Since Heather divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of them will receive 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins. Therefore, the remaining raisins for the oatmeal cookies will be 27 - 9 = 18 cups.

Now, we need to divide the number of cups of raisins available for the oatmeal cookies by the amount of raisins required for each batch. A batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. Therefore, the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make is given by:

18 ÷ (3/4) = 18 × (4/3) = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then multiply it by the cost per kilowatt hour.

Let's denote the daily consumption before adding the device as $d_1 = 12$ kilowatts per hour, and the daily consumption after adding the device as $d_2 = 12 + 2 = 14$ kilowatts per hour.

The weekly consumption before adding the device is $w_1 = d_1 \cdot 7 = 12 \cdot 7 = 84$ kilowatts per hour, and the weekly consumption after adding the device is $w_2 = d_2 \cdot 7 = 14 \cdot 7 = 98$ kilowatts per hour.

Given that the cost per kilowatt hour is $c = $1.50, we can calculate the weekly cost before adding the device as $C_1 = w_1 \cdot c = 84 \cdot 1.50 = $126, and the weekly cost after adding the device as $C_2 = w_2 \cdot c = 98 \cdot 1.50 = $147.

The difference in weekly electric bill is $\Delta C = C_2 - C_1 = 147 - 126 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we need to consider the rate at which one person paints a house and then scale it up to the number of people.

Let's denote the rate at which one person paints a house as R. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can express this as:

R = 1/2 house / 5 days = 1/10 house per day

Now, we need to find the combined rate at which 5 people paint a house. Since the rate is directly proportional to the number of people, we can multiply the rate of one person by 5:

Combined rate = 5 * R = 5 * (1/10 house per day) = 1/2 house per day

Since the combined rate is 1/2 house per day, it would take 5 people 2 days to paint a whole house. To convert this to hours, we multiply the number of days by the number of hours in a day:

Time = 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is: 48"
"Given the scenario, we can establish the following relationships between the number of sofas and chairs for Ophelia and Jenna:

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as C. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas she has can be expressed as C - 2. We are given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation:

C - 2 = 20

Solving for C, we get:

C = 22

Now, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so the number of chairs Jenna has is 3C = 3(22) = 66.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas she has can be expressed as 66 - 2 = 64.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna:

Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so the total number of pieces of furniture she has is 20 + 22 = 42.

Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so the total number of pieces of furniture she has is 64 + 66 = 130.

The total number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna is 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: $\boxed{172}$"
"To determine the number of additional CDs Tom could have purchased if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to calculate the number of CDs he could have bought with the money spent on the headphone set and then subtract the number of CDs he actually bought.

Let's denote the cost of one CD as $4 and the cost of the headphone set as $44. The total amount Tom spent is $48.

The number of CDs Tom could have bought with the money spent on the headphone set is calculated as follows:

$$\frac{\text{Cost of headphone set}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} = \frac{\$44}{\$4} = 11$$

Since Tom actually bought one CD, the number of CDs he could have bought without the headphone set is:

$$11 - 1 = 10$$

Therefore, Tom could have bought 10 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the varying hours he spent each week. Let's break it down:

1. For the weeks where he spent 4 hours, there are 6 weeks (8 weeks total - 2 weeks with 5 hours and 1 week with 6 hours). The total hours for these weeks can be calculated as follows:

6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 6 × 4 = 24 hours

2. For the weeks where he spent 5 hours, there are 2 weeks. The total hours for these weeks can be calculated as follows:

2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 2 × 5 = 10 hours

3. For the week where he spent 6 hours, there is 1 week. The total hours for this week can be calculated as follows:

1 week * 6 hours/week = 1 × 6 = 6 hours

Now, we add up the total hours: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of passengers after the second stop, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Now, we need to determine the number of passengers who get on at the second stop. It is stated that 3 times fewer passengers get on than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, we need to find 3 times 21, which is 63. However, since we are looking for the number of passengers who get on, we need to subtract 63 from the number of passengers who got off, which is 21. This results in a negative number, indicating that more passengers got on than got off. Therefore, we should interpret this as 63 more passengers got on.

So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is:
59 (left) + 63 (got in) = 122

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Given that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, we can express his current age as $x$. Therefore, we have the equation $x + 5 = 27$, which simplifies to $x = 22$.

In 8 years, Jame's age will be $x + 8 = 22 + 8 = 30$. Let's denote Jame's cousin's current age as $y$. In 8 years, Jame's cousin's age will be $y + 8$. According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. This can be expressed as the equation $y + 8 = 2(30) - 5$, which simplifies to $y + 8 = 55$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = 47$.

Now, we need to find the difference between Jame's current age and his cousin's current age. This can be calculated as $|22 - 47| = 25$.

The final numerical answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Given the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400, and the computer costs $1,100, we can deduce the cost of the printer by subtracting $400 from the cost of the computer, as the printer costs $400 less than the computer.

Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
= $1,100 - $400
= $700

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer, which is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. To find the cost of the 2 monitors, we subtract this amount from the total cost:

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer and printer
= $2,400 - $1,800
= $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we can find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the monitors by 2:

Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
= $600 / 2
= $300

The final answer is: $300"
"Given that 20 kids were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys for a scavenger hunt, we can infer that there are 10 boys and 10 girls. The boys collected 60 seashells each, resulting in a total of 10 * 60 = 600 seashells.

The girls collected an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be expressed as 60 + 4 * 60. To calculate this, we first multiply 4 and 60, which equals 240. Then, we add 60 to this result, yielding 300. Therefore, the girls collected 300 seashells more than the boys.

To find the total number of seashells collected by the girls, we add the additional amount to the total collected by the boys: 600 + 300 = 900 seashells.

Since there are 10 girls, we can determine the number of seashells collected by each girl by dividing the total collected by the girls by the number of girls: 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the initial number of candies George had as x.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, the number of candies Nick had initially is 2x.

We are given that George ate 5 candies and now has 3 candies left. This can be represented as:

x - 5 = 3

To find the value of x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 3 + 5
x = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick had initially by multiplying 2x:

2x = 2(8)
2x = 16

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine Anne's age, we need to establish the age of Alyana first. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4

Given that Chenny is 10 years old, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we can determine Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age, as Anne is 2 years older than Alyana:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the total thickness of the four books, we can start by identifying the thickness of each book.

The first book is 31 mm thick. 

The second book is 50 mm thick.

The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so we can express its thickness as 50 - 5 = 45 mm.

The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness can be calculated as 2 * 31 = 62 mm.

Now, we can find the total thickness of the four books by adding their individual thicknesses together:

Total thickness = 31 + 50 + 45 + 62

Using the commutative property of addition, we can rearrange the terms to simplify the calculation:

Total thickness = (31 + 62) + (50 + 45)
Total thickness = 93 + 95
Total thickness = 188

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{188}$"
"To determine the number of vlogs Emma should make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of vlogs she aims to make and the number of vlogs she has already created.

Let's denote the total number of vlogs Emma aims to make as T = 72, and the number of vlogs she has already made as M. We know that M = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54.

Now, we can calculate the number of vlogs Emma should make to complete her goal by subtracting M from T:

T - M = 72 - 54
T - M = 18

Therefore, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the total amount you paid, we need to calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. This can be done by multiplying the bill by the decimal equivalent of 20%, which is 0.20.

The calculation is as follows:

Tip = 0.20 * $50
Tip = $10

Now, we add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount you paid.

Total amount = $50 (bill) + $10 (tip)
Total amount = $60

Therefore, the total amount you paid is $60."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a series of steps.

Let's denote the eldest boy's initial share as $x. Since the total amount is shared among 3 boys, we have:

$$x + x + x = 18$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$3x = 18$$

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

$$x = 6$$

So, the eldest boy's initial share is $6.

Now, let's calculate the amount he has after adding $5 and $10:

$$6 + 5 + 10 = 21$$

He then spends $8, leaving him with:

$$21 - 8 = 13$$

Finally, he triples the amount he has left after spending the $8:

$$13 \times 3 = 39$$

Therefore, the eldest boy now has $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"To determine the daily savings amount for the second half of the month, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of days in the first half of April as x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be 30 - x.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. If we let y be the daily savings amount in the first half, then the daily savings amount in the second half will be 2y.

The total amount saved in the first half is xy, and the total amount saved in the second half is 2xy. The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is xy + 2xy = 3xy.

We are given that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3xy = 1125

Since x is the number of days in the first half, and the total number of days in April is 30, we can write x + (30 - x) = 30, which simplifies to 30 = 30. However, this is not useful in finding x. Instead, we can use the fact that the total number of days in April is 30 to set up the equation x + (30 - x) = 30, which is true for any x. We can use the fact that the total number of days in April is 30 to set up the equation x + (30 - x) = 30, which is true for any x. However, we can use the fact that the total number of days in April is 30 to set up the equation 2x = 30, which simplifies to x = 15.

Now we can substitute x = 15 into the equation 3xy = 1125 to find y:

3(15)y = 1125

Simplifying the equation, we get:

45y = 1125

To find y, we divide both sides by 45:

y = 1125 / 45
y = 25

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the amount saved in the second half is 2y = 2(25) = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she purchased and subtract that from the $20 she gave.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 \* $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 \* $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 \* $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

The total cost of the fruits is $13. To find the change, we subtract this from the $20 Verna gave: $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny, we need to calculate their total earnings based on the number of tasks completed.

Let's denote the amount Jairus earns per task as $0.8 and the amount Jenny earns per task as $0.5. Given that both completed 20 tasks, we can calculate their total earnings as follows:

Jairus' total earnings = 0.8 * 20 = $16
Jenny's total earnings = 0.5 * 20 = $10

Now, we can find the difference in their earnings by subtracting Jenny's total earnings from Jairus' total earnings:

Difference = Jairus' total earnings - Jenny's total earnings = 16 - 10 = $6

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's share can be represented as 4x.

The total amount they are dividing is $100, so the sum of their shares is equal to 100. This can be expressed as the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 100

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 100 / 5
x = 20

Now that we know Brad's share, we can find Jeff's share by multiplying x by 4:

Jeff's share = 4x
= 4(20)
= 80

Therefore, Jeff gets $80.

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

The distance to work is given as 3 miles. Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Now, we need to find the total miles he walks in a week. Since he works 5 times a week, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the total miles walked in a week:

Total miles = n * d
where n is the number of days worked and d is the miles walked each day.

Plugging in the values, we get:
Total miles = 5 * 6
Total miles = 30 miles

Therefore, Jeff walks a total of 30 miles in a week.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we can break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which consists of 26 letters each time. Therefore, the total number of letters written in this step is 2 * 26 = 52.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, half of it is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

Now, she re-writes everything she has already written. This includes the 52 letters from the first step and the 13 letters from the second step, totaling 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters she has written is 65 + 65 = 130.

The final answer is: $\boxed{130}$"
"This problem can be modeled as a geometric progression, where the number of families notified in each round is multiplied by 3. The sequence starts with 3 families in the first round, then 3 * 3 = 9 families in the second round, 9 * 3 = 27 families in the third round, and so on.

To find the number of families notified in the fourth round, we can use the formula for the nth term of a geometric progression: a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1), where a_1 is the first term (3 in this case), r is the common ratio (3 in this case), and n is the term number (4 in this case).

a_4 = 3 * 3^(4-1)
a_4 = 3 * 3^3
a_4 = 3 * 27
a_4 = 81

The final answer is: 81"
"To determine Mark's initial weight, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Mark's initial weight as 'x'. Since he lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, the total weight lost is 10 * 3 = 30 pounds.

We know that his final weight is 70 pounds, so we can set up the equation:

x - 30 = 70

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. We can do this by adding 30 to both sides of the equation:

x = 70 + 30
x = 100

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first calculate the total number of toys in the larger play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys and the larger play set is five times larger, we can express this relationship as a multiplication problem.

Let's denote the number of toys in the larger play set as L. We can write the equation:

L = 5 × 80

Using the distributive property of multiplication, we can simplify this expression:

L = 5 × 80
L = (5 × 80)
L = 400

Now that we know the total number of toys in the larger play set, we can set up an equation to find the number of toys Jonathan currently has. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as J. We are given that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's play set. This can be expressed as:

J + 2 = 400

To solve for J, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

J = 400 - 2
J = 398

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The final answer is: 398"
"To determine the total cost of the items Daniel wants to purchase, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

- The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 \* $1.50 = $7.50.
- The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 \* $0.25 = $0.50.
- The cost of 1 calculator at $12 each is $12.
- The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 each is $10.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

To apply the 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $30, which is 0.1 \* $30 = $3.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $30 - $3 = $27.

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

The final answer is: $27"
"To calculate the total cost of the items, we can use the formula for the sum of the products of quantities and prices.

Let's denote the number of hamburgers as H, the number of packs of potato fries as F, and the number of cans of fruit drinks as D. The prices of these items are $4, $0.30, and $2, respectively.

The total cost (TC) can be calculated as follows:

TC = (H x $4) + (F x $0.30) + (D x $2)

Given the quantities:
H = 5
F = 10
D = 5

Substituting these values into the equation:

TC = (5 x $4) + (10 x $0.30) + (5 x $2)
TC = $20 + $3 + $10
TC = $33

Now, to find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill:

Change = $50 - $33
Change = $17

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to apply the commission-based salary system. The system has two commission rates: 30% for the first $1000 in sales and an additional 10% for sales exceeding $1000.

Let's break down the calculation:

1. Commission for the first $1000: 
   Commission rate = 30% = 0.3
   Sales amount = $1000
   Commission = Commission rate * Sales amount
   Commission = 0.3 * $1000
   Commission = $300

2. Commission for sales over $1000:
   Sales over $1000 = $2500 - $1000 = $1500
   Additional commission rate = 10% = 0.1
   Additional commission = Additional commission rate * Sales over $1000
   Additional commission = 0.1 * $1500
   Additional commission = $150

3. Total commission:
   Total commission = Commission for the first $1000 + Additional commission
   Total commission = $300 + $150
   Total commission = $450

Therefore, the total amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of bottles required for his party. 

Bill has 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. Therefore, the total number of bottles he already has is 2 * 24 = 48.

Next, we need to calculate the number of bottles required for his guests. Since he wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, the total number of bottles needed for his guests is 70 * 2 = 140.

To find the total number of bottles required, we add the number of bottles he already has to the number of bottles needed for his guests: 48 + 140 = 188.

Since Bill already has 48 bottles, he needs to buy 188 - 48 = 140 additional bottles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the time difference in swimming 3 miles between a cold day and a hot day, we need to calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on each day.

First, let's find the time it takes Ray to swim a mile on a hot day. We know that on a cold day, he swims a mile in 16 minutes. On a hot day, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. Therefore, we can express this as:

Time to swim a mile on a hot day = 2 * Time to swim a mile on a cold day + 2
= 2 * 16 + 2
= 32 + 2
= 34 minutes

Now, we can find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day by multiplying the time it takes him to swim a mile on a hot day by 3:

Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day = 3 * Time to swim a mile on a hot day
= 3 * 34
= 102 minutes

Similarly, we can find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day by multiplying the time it takes him to swim a mile on a cold day by 3:

Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day = 3 * Time to swim a mile on a cold day
= 3 * 16
= 48 minutes

Now, we can find the difference in time between the two days:

Difference in time = Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day - Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day
= 102 - 48
= 54 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the target savings by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings can be calculated as follows:

$$\text{Daily Earnings} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours/day} = 10 \text{ dollars/day}$$

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings can be calculated as:

$$\text{Weekly Earnings} = 10 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ dollars/week}$$

Now, we can divide the target savings by his weekly earnings to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80:

$$\text{Number of Weeks} = \frac{\text{Target Savings}}{\text{Weekly Earnings}} = \frac{80 \text{ dollars}}{40 \text{ dollars/week}} = 2 \text{ weeks}$$

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total cost of lunch at Subway, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. Since it costs thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub, we can express this relationship as a multiplication factor of 3.

Let's denote the cost of the foot-long fish sub as $40. The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub can be calculated as follows:

Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 × Cost of the foot-long fish sub
= 3 × $40
= $120

Now, we can find the total cost for both subs by adding their individual costs:

Total cost = Cost of the foot-long fish sub + Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub
= $40 + $120
= $160

The final answer is: $160"
"To determine the total number of holes in the bag of buttons, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes.

Let's denote the number of buttons with 2 holes as B2 and the number of buttons with 4 holes as B4. We are given that B2 = 7. The total number of buttons is 21, so B4 = 21 - B2 = 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes is 2B2 = 2(7) = 14.

The total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes is 4B4 = 4(14) = 56.

The total number of holes in all the buttons is 2B2 + 4B4 = 14 + 56 = 70.

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the size of Peter's locker, we need to establish the relationship between the lockers' volumes. Given that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we can express the volumes of the other lockers as fractions of this value.

Let's denote Timothy's locker as T = 24 cubic inches. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so Zack's locker can be expressed as Z = T / 2 = 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches.

Now, we need to find the volume of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. This can be expressed as P = Z / 4 = (24 / 2) / 4 = 24 / 8 = 3 cubic inches.

Therefore, the volume of Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we first need to establish the current amount he consumes. 

Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as x. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, her daily intake is x/2. Given that Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks, his current daily intake is 10 * (x/2) = 5x.

We are given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. Therefore, x = 4.

Now, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake:
Juan drinks 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups of coffee.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then sum them.

Let's denote the number of hamsters as H and the number of guinea pigs as G. We are given that there are 3 cages of hamsters and 3 cages of guinea pigs. Since each cage contains 10 hamsters and 5 guinea pigs, we can express this as:

H = 3 * 10 = 30
G = 3 * 5 = 15

Now, we can find the total number of rodents by adding the number of hamsters and guinea pigs:

Total number of rodents = H + G = 30 + 15 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To determine the average weight of the three friends, we must first calculate their total weight and then divide by 3.

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so we can express her weight as 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Bob's weight is twice that of Susan's, which can be calculated as 2 × 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the total weight of the three friends by adding their individual weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by 3: 540 ÷ 3 = 180 pounds.

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"Given the problem, we can model the situation using a linear equation. Let's denote the initial angle of the pyramid as θ (theta) and the angle the sun moves per hour as α (alpha). The total angle moved by the sun after t hours is αt.

We are given:
θ = 32 degrees (initial angle of the pyramid)
α = 5 degrees/hour (angle the sun moves per hour)
t = 10 hours (number of hours the sun moves)

The total angle from the ground to the sun is the sum of the initial angle and the angle moved by the sun, which can be expressed as:

θ + αt

Substituting the given values, we get:

θ + αt = 32 + 5t
= 32 + 5(10)
= 32 + 50
= 82 degrees

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 82 degrees.

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine the total number of candles James needs, we must consider the age of each son. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, making him 8 years old. 

The total number of candles required is the sum of their ages, which is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we can calculate the number of packs needed by dividing the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

The cost of 4 packs of candles is then 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Given that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week by finding the number of 1.5 minute intervals in 105 minutes. This can be done by dividing 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Therefore, in two weeks, Judy read a total of 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To determine the number of sandwiches left, we need to calculate the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor. 

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which can be expressed as (1/3) * 12. To calculate this, we can multiply 12 by the fraction 1/3, which is equivalent to dividing 12 by 3.

(1/3) * 12 = 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which can be expressed as (1/4) * 12. To calculate this, we can multiply 12 by the fraction 1/4, which is equivalent to dividing 12 by 4.

(1/4) * 12 = 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

Now, we need to find the total number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor. This is simply the sum of the sandwiches eaten by each of them.

Total sandwiches eaten = 4 (by Cody) + 3 (by Trevor) = 7 sandwiches.

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the initial number of sandwiches.

Number of sandwiches left = 12 - 7 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's age today as x.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. 
In 7 years, his nephew's age will be x + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. 
So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 
First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: 

$$\frac{51}{3} = x + 7$$

This simplifies to:

$$17 = x + 7$$

Next, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

$$17 - 7 = x$$

This simplifies to:

$$x = 10$$

"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the payment structure and calculate the total.

The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth. 

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, resulting in a total of $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $\frac{1}{2}$. So, the total for the last two teeth is 2 * $\frac{1}{2}$ = $1.00.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To determine the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we can start by establishing the relationship between their scores.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, the number of goals scored by Anna as A, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

We are given that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can express this as R = M + 20.

We are also given that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can express this as R = A + 45.

Since we know that Richie scored 80 goals, we can substitute this value into the equations:

M + 20 = 80
A + 45 = 80

Solving for M and A, we get:

M = 80 - 20 = 60
A = 80 - 45 = 35

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers by adding their individual scores:

Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers is 175."
"To determine the difference in earnings between Liam and Mitchell, we need to calculate the total amount each individual made from selling lemonades.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece. To find the total amount he made, we multiply the number of lemonades sold by the price per lemonade: 21 × 4 = $84.

Now, we subtract the amount Liam made ($63) from the amount Mitchell made ($84) to find the difference: 84 - 63 = 21.

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam selling lemonade that weekend.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and add them up.

Let's start by calculating the number of wooden action figures Peter bought from Sunday through Wednesday. He spent $5 each day on wooden action figures, so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is 4 * $5 = $20. Since he spent $20, he bought 20 / 5 = 4 wooden action figures.

Now, let's calculate the number of plastic action figures Peter can buy from Thursday through Saturday. He has $70 - $20 = $50 left. He has 5 days left, so the total number of plastic action figures he can buy is 50 / 2 = 25.

In total, Peter bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 4 + 25 = 29.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the kitten, we need to consider the expenses associated with spaying, vaccinations, and the damage caused by the kitten.

The cost of spaying the kitten is a fixed expense, which is $200. 

The cost of the vaccines can be calculated by multiplying the number of vaccines by the cost per vaccine: 3 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $60.

The cost of the broken vases is also a straightforward calculation: 4 vases * $12/vase = $48.

Now, we can add up these expenses to find the total cost: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

Therefore, the total cost of the kitten is $308."
"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

Let's denote the number of roses ordered by the first flower shop as $R_1 = 20$, the second flower shop as $R_2 = 15$, and the third flower shop as $R_3 = 30$. The total number of roses ordered per week is the sum of these values: $R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65$ roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the total number of roses ordered per month by multiplying the weekly total by 4: $R_{monthly} = R_{total} \times 4 = 65 \times 4 = 260$ roses per month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per month. If he grows 40 roses every week, then the total number of roses he grows per month is $G_{monthly} = 40 \times 4 = 160$ roses per month.

To find the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: $L = R_{monthly} - G_{monthly} = 260 - 160 = 100$ roses per month.

"To determine the remaining amount in Katina's account after 2 years, we can use a simple linear depreciation model. The formula for this is:

A = P - (R * t)

Where:
- A is the amount remaining in the account
- P is the initial principal amount (initial amount in the account)
- R is the monthly rate of withdrawal
- t is the time in months

Given that Katina has $3000 in her savings account and removes $100 every month, we can plug in the values as follows:

P = $3000
R = $100
t = 2 years * 12 months/year = 24 months

A = $3000 - ($100 * 24)
A = $3000 - $2400
A = $600

Therefore, the remaining amount in Katina's account after 2 years is $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To determine the net profit of the food truck, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf yields 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30 per sandwich.

The cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches. To find the cost per sandwich, we divide the cost by the number of sandwiches: $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00 per sandwich.

The total cost per sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and cheese and condiments: $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30 per sandwich.

The total revenue is the selling price per sandwich multiplied by the number of sandwiches sold: 10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $70.00 (total revenue) - $33.00 (total cost) = $37.00.

"To determine the total amount of money Kate can make from selling her muffin crayons, we need to calculate the total number of muffin crayons she can produce and then multiply that by the price of each muffin crayon.

First, let's find the total number of crayons Kate has. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we can calculate this as:

3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons

Next, we need to find out how many muffin crayons she can make from these 192 crayons. Since each muffin crayon is made from 8 crayons, we can divide the total number of crayons by 8:

192 crayons / 8 crayons/muffin crayon = 24 muffin crayons

Now that we know Kate can make 24 muffin crayons, we can calculate the total amount of money she can make by multiplying the number of muffin crayons by the price of each:

24 muffin crayons * $1.50/muffin crayon = $36

Therefore, Kate can make $36 from selling her muffin crayons.

The final answer is: $36"
"To calculate the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to consider the area of the bedroom, the cost of the materials, and the labor costs.

First, we calculate the area of the bedroom, which is given by the product of its length and width. The length of the bedroom is 18 feet and the width is 12 feet, so the area is:

Area = length × width
= 18 ft × 12 ft
= 216 sq ft

Next, we calculate the cost of the materials. The new carpet costs $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is:

Cost of carpet = Area × cost per square foot
= 216 sq ft × $12/sq ft
= $2592

The padding costs $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is:

Cost of padding = Area × cost per square foot
= 216 sq ft × $2/sq ft
= $432

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is:

Cost of removal = Area × cost per square foot
= 216 sq ft × $4/sq ft
= $864

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is:

Cost of installation = Area × cost per square foot
= 216 sq ft × $34/sq ft
= $7344

Now, we calculate the total cost of the materials by adding the cost of the carpet, padding, and removal:

Total cost of materials = Cost of carpet + Cost of padding + Cost of removal
= $2592 + $432 + $864
= $3888

The total cost of labor is the sum of the cost of removal and installation:

Total cost of labor = Cost of removal + Cost of installation
= $864 + $7344
= $8208

Finally, we calculate the total cost to replace the carpet by adding the total cost of materials and labor:

Total cost = Total cost of materials + Total cost of labor
= $3888 + $8208
= $12196

The final answer is: $12196"
"To calculate the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to compute the arithmetic mean of the total number of birds observed over the week.

- Days 1-2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4-5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

We can calculate the total number of birds by summing the individual counts:

Total birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90
Total birds = 280

Since there are 7 days in the week, we can calculate the average number of birds per day by dividing the total number of birds by the number of days:

Average birds per day = Total birds / Number of days
Average birds per day = 280 / 7
Average birds per day = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the final value of the number train, we can break down the given operations step by step.

Let's denote the starting value of the number train as $x$. We are given that $x = 20$.

1. The first operation involves adding half the number to the starting value: $x + \frac{x}{2} = 20 + \frac{20}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30$.
2. The next operation is to divide the result by 5: $\frac{30}{5} = 6$.
3. Finally, we multiply the result by the starting value minus 12: $6 \cdot (20 - 12) = 6 \cdot 8 = 48$.

Therefore, the final value of the number train is $\boxed{48}$."

"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. This can be found by taking the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, dividing by the set temperature, and then multiplying by 100.

Let's denote the set temperature as $T_s = 450$ and the actual temperature as $T_a = 468$. The percentage by which the oven is off is given by:

$\frac{T_a - T_s}{T_s} \times 100 = \frac{468 - 450}{450} \times 100 = \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\%$

Since the oven is off by 4%, to find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to subtract 4% of 520 from 520.

4% of 520 is given by $0.04 \times 520 = 20.8$.

The temperature Maggie should set the oven to is $520 - 20.8 = 499.2$.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the temperature Maggie should set the oven to is 499.

The final answer is: $\boxed{499}$"
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

Let's start by converting the time of the first movie into minutes. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. We can express this as a sum of hours and minutes: 1 hour + 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can rewrite this as 60 minutes + 30 minutes. Adding these together gives us 90 minutes for the first movie.

Next, we'll convert the time of the second movie into minutes. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can express this as a sum of hours and minutes: 2 hours + 5 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can rewrite this as 2 * 60 minutes + 5 minutes. This simplifies to 120 minutes + 5 minutes, which equals 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we add the time for both movies together: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{215}$"
"To determine the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. This can be expressed as:

Let H = Herb's house price
Juan's house price = H - 0.3H
= 0.7H

Given that Herb's house price is $76,000, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Juan's house price = 0.7($76,000)
= $53,200

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses. This can be calculated as:

Combined value = H + 0.7H
= 1.7H
= $76,000 + $53,200
= $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To determine the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend, we need to calculate the number of cups and dishes each brought and then sum the total.

Let's denote the number of cups Judy bought as C. Since she bought a dozen cups, C = 12.

Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups, so the number of dishes she bought is 2C = 2 * 12 = 24.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so the number of dishes her friend brought is 24 + 20 = 44.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes Judy brought: C = 12, 2C = 24. The total number of utensils Judy brought is C + 2C = 12 + 24 = 36.

Next, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes her friend brought: 40 cups and 44 dishes. The total number of utensils her friend brought is 40 + 44 = 84.

To find the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend, we add the total number of utensils each brought: 36 (Judy) + 84 (friend) = 120.

"To determine the cost per pair of contacts, we need to calculate the total number of pairs of contacts and the total cost of the contacts.

First, let's find the number of pairs of contacts Pete uses per day. Since 90 single-use contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of pairs of contacts he uses per day as follows:

$$\frac{90 \text{ contacts}}{45 \text{ days}} = 2 \text{ contacts/day}$$

Since each pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts, the number of pairs of contacts Pete uses per day is:

$$\frac{2 \text{ contacts/day}}{2 \text{ contacts/pair}} = 1 \text{ pair/day}$$

Now, let's find the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will have. Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have a total of:

$$2 \text{ boxes} \times 90 \text{ contacts/box} = 180 \text{ contacts}$$

Since each pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts, the total number of pairs of contacts is:

$$\frac{180 \text{ contacts}}{2 \text{ contacts/pair}} = 90 \text{ pairs}$$

The cost of 2 boxes with a 10% discount is:

$$2 \text{ boxes} \times \$100/\text{box} = \$200$$

The discount is 10% of the total cost, which is:

$$\frac{10}{100} \times \$200 = \$20$$

So, the total cost after the discount is:

$$\$200 - \$20 = \$180$$

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts:

$$\frac{\$180}{90 \text{ pairs}} = \$2 \text{ per pair}$$

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings based on their respective work hours and hourly wage.

Jill worked a total of 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, which gives us a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings can be calculated as follows:

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Therefore, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings can be calculated as follows:

John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:

Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings
= $70 - $30
= $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total calories burned during her activities. 

Let's denote the calories burned during aerobics as C_a and the calories burned during running as C_r. Given that she spends 2 hours doing aerobics and 1 hour running, and the respective calorie burn rates are 500 calories/hour and 600 calories/hour, we can express this as:

C_a = 2 * 500 = 1000 calories
C_r = 1 * 600 = 600 calories

The total calories burned, C_total, is the sum of C_a and C_r:

C_total = C_a + C_r = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Now, we need to find the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink. Since she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can express this as a ratio of water to calories:

Water per 200 calories = 100 ml

To find the total amount of water needed, we divide the total calories burned by 200 and multiply by 100:

Total water = (C_total / 200) * 100
           = (1600 / 200) * 100
           = 8 * 100
           = 800 ml

The final answer is: $\boxed{800}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of red, blue, and green jelly beans. Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:

R = 0.99B

Additionally, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we have:

G = 1.01B

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3.01:

B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find R and G:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485

G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To find the average of Jared's typing speed measurements, we need to calculate the arithmetic mean of the three values. 

Let's denote Jared's initial typing speed as x1 = 47 WPM, his second typing speed as x2 = 52 WPM, and his third typing speed as x3 = x2 + 5 = 57 WPM.

The average (μ) of the three measurements can be calculated using the formula:

μ = (x1 + x2 + x3) / 3

Substituting the given values, we get:

μ = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3

First, we add the values: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

Then, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

Therefore, the average of Jared's typing speed measurements is 52 WPM.

The final answer is: 52"
"To determine the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the weight change for each option over a period of 5 weeks.

Let's denote the weight change per week for eating Cheerios as $L$ and the weight change per week for eating donuts as $G$. We are given that $L = -1.25$ pounds and $G = 1.75$ pounds.

The weight change after 5 weeks for each option can be calculated as follows:

Weight change after 5 weeks for eating Cheerios: $L \cdot 5 = -1.25 \cdot 5 = -6.25$ pounds
Weight change after 5 weeks for eating donuts: $G \cdot 5 = 1.75 \cdot 5 = 8.75$ pounds

The difference in weight between the two options is given by the absolute value of the difference between the weight change for eating donuts and the weight change for eating Cheerios:

$|G \cdot 5 - L \cdot 5| = |8.75 - (-6.25)| = |8.75 + 6.25| = 15$ pounds

Therefore, the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 15 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we need to consider the chain of invitations and the additional guests brought by Alex's friends.

First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email. Each of the 100 invited individuals brings 2 friends, resulting in a total of 100 + (100 * 2) = 300 people.

Next, we need to account for the additional guests brought by Alex's friends. She calls 10 friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses, totaling 18 people.

To find the total number of people attending, we add the number of people invited via email and the number of people brought by Alex's friends: 300 + 18 = 318.

However, this count includes Alex herself, so we need to add 1 to the total to account for her presence.

Therefore, the total number of seats needed is 318 + 1 = 319.

The final answer is: $\boxed{319}$"
"To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we can establish a sequence of relationships between the weights of the four dogs. Let's denote the weight of the Affenpinscher as A, the Dachshund as D, the Papillon as P, and the Mastiff as M.

Given that the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, we have D = 2A.

Since the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, we can express this as P = D/4 = (2A)/4 = A/2.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so M = 44P = 44(A/2) = 22A.

We are given that the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds, so A = 10. Substituting this into the equation for M, we get M = 22(10) = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To determine the cost difference between purchasing the boots on Amazon and eBay, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform.

The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16, and the shipping cost is $4. Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and the shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8. Thus, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference in cost, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"Given that the beanstalk doubles in height every day and starts at 4 feet, we can model this situation using exponential growth. The height of the beanstalk on the nth day can be represented by the equation:

h(n) = 4 * 2^(n-1)

We are interested in finding the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet. This can be represented as:

4 * 2^(n-1) > 20

To solve for n, we can divide both sides by 4:

2^(n-1) > 5

Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we get:

n - 1 > log2(5)

Adding 1 to both sides:

n > log2(5) + 1

Using a calculator or logarithm table, we find that log2(5) ≈ 2.3219. Therefore:

n > 2.3219 + 1
n > 3.3219

Since n must be an integer (we can't have a fraction of a day), the smallest integer greater than 3.3219 is 4.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms daily, we first need to establish the protein content per gram of mushrooms. Given that a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein content per gram of mushrooms as follows:

Protein per gram = Total protein / Total weight
= 3 grams / 100 grams
= 0.03 grams per gram

Now, we can find the daily protein intake by multiplying the weight of mushrooms John eats by the protein content per gram:

Daily protein intake = Weight of mushrooms * Protein per gram
= 200 grams * 0.03 grams/gram
= 6 grams

To find the weekly protein intake, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7:

Weekly protein intake = Daily protein intake * 7
= 6 grams * 7
= 42 grams

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's analyze the problem: Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. We can represent Jerry's current age as 'x'. This situation can be modeled using a linear equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To determine the number of hours George needs to work to pay for the dental work, we must first calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000. Since George needs 2 implants, the total base price is 2 × $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find the number of hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $\frac{\$3900}{\$15} = 260$ hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{260}$"
"Given the problem, we can denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it is 3x.

The sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the number of gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the given coins into their respective values in cents:

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, we can find the total amount of money by adding these values together:

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15
= 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can find the number of gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

The final answer is: 69"
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and sum them together.

First, let's consider the number of legs for each type of pet. Dogs have 4 legs each, cats have 4 legs each, and birds have 2 legs each.

Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of birds as B. We are given that D = 5, C = 2, and B = 10.

The total number of legs can be calculated as follows:

Total legs = (D x 4) + (C x 4) + (B x 2)
Total legs = (5 x 4) + (2 x 4) + (10 x 2)
Total legs = 20 + 8 + 20
Total legs = 48

Therefore, the total number of legs in the pet store is 48."
"To determine the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we can apply the concept of percentage increase. 

First, we calculate 50% of 8 pounds, which is equivalent to 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds. 

Now, we add this increase to the original weight: 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, Jamaal then uses a weight two pounds lighter than this, so we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds: 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

Therefore, the weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he gets each year and add them up.

Let's break it down year by year:

In the first year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. Additionally, he purchases 1 game per month for 12 months, which amounts to 12 games. Therefore, the total number of games he gets in the first year is 10 + 12 = 22 games.

In the second year, Steve receives 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He purchases 2 games per month for 12 months, which amounts to 24 games. Thus, the total number of games he gets in the second year is 5 + 24 = 29 games.

In the third year, Steve receives 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He purchases 4 games per month for 12 months, which amounts to 48 games. Therefore, the total number of games he gets in the third year is 5 + 48 = 53 games.

Now, let's calculate the total number of games Steve has after 3 years by adding the number of games he gets each year: 22 + 29 + 53 = 104 games.

The final answer is: $\boxed{104}$"
"Given the plane's speed, we can calculate the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles using the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

First, we need to determine the plane's rate, which is its speed. We can find this by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken:

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles:

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, the additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles is 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours, we need to determine their individual hourly production rates and then multiply these rates by the number of hours worked.

Ruiz's hourly production rate can be calculated by dividing the total pounds of chocolates he makes in 2 hours by 2. This yields:

$$\frac{120\text{ pounds}}{2\text{ hours}} = 60\text{ pounds/hour}$$

Marissa's hourly production rate is 3/4 times Ruiz's hourly production rate. Therefore, we can calculate her hourly production rate as follows:

$$\frac{3}{4} \times 60\text{ pounds/hour} = 45\text{ pounds/hour}$$

Now, we can calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds made by each individual in 12 hours by multiplying their hourly production rates by 12:

Ruiz's total production in 12 hours: $60\text{ pounds/hour} \times 12\text{ hours} = 720\text{ pounds}$
Marissa's total production in 12 hours: $45\text{ pounds/hour} \times 12\text{ hours} = 540\text{ pounds}$

The total amount of chocolate pounds made by Ruiz and Marissa together in 12 hours is the sum of their individual productions:

$720\text{ pounds} + 540\text{ pounds} = 1260\text{ pounds}$

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"
"To determine the amount of money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent at the arcade and subtract it from the original amount.

Let's denote the amount spent on Monday as M. We know that M = $8.

On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so the amount spent on Tuesday is 2M = 2 * $8 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so the amount spent on Wednesday is 4 * 2M = 4 * 2 * $8 = $64.

The total amount spent is the sum of the amounts spent on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:
M + 2M + 4M = 7M
Substituting M = $8, we get:
7M = 7 * $8 = $56

However, we made an error in our calculation. The correct total amount spent is the sum of the amounts spent on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:
M + 2M + 4M = 7M
7M = $8 + 2 * $8 + 4 * 2 * $8
7M = $8 + $16 + $64
7M = $88

The correct total amount spent is $88. To find the amount of money Howard has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount:
$100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To calculate the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we need to calculate the total number of cups sold and the total amount earned from each period, then add them together.

Let's break it down:

For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. The total number of cups sold in this period is given by the product of the number of cups sold per hour and the number of hours:

$$\text{Total cups sold in 4 hours} = 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups}$$

The total amount earned in this period is the product of the total number of cups sold and the price per cup:

$$\text{Total amount earned in 4 hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30$$

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup. The total number of cups sold in this period is given by the product of the number of cups sold per hour and the number of hours:

$$\text{Total cups sold in 2 hours} = 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups}$$

The total amount earned in this period is the product of the total number of cups sold and the price per cup:

$$\text{Total amount earned in 2 hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12$$

The total amount earned in 6 hours is the sum of the total amount earned in each period:

$$\text{Total amount earned in 6 hours} = \$30 + \$12 = \$42$$

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the lifespan of the tires, we need to calculate the total number of rotations they can undergo before needing replacement and then divide that by the number of rotations per month.

Given that the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the total number of rotations per mile as follows:

Rotations per mile = 725 rotations / 2 miles
Rotations per mile = 362.5 rotations/mile

Now, we can find the total number of rotations the tires can undergo in a month by multiplying the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per mile:

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile
Rotations per month = 290,000 rotations/month

However, we are given that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement. To find the number of months the tires can last, we divide the total rotations allowed by the rotations per month:

Months before replacement = Total rotations allowed / Rotations per month
Months before replacement = 10,440,000 / 290,000
Months before replacement = 36

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the number of years by dividing the total months by 12:

Years before replacement = Months before replacement / 12
Years before replacement = 36 / 12
Years before replacement = 3

Therefore, the tires will need to be replaced in 3 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the cost per pump of the shampoo, we need to calculate the total number of pumps in the bottle and then divide the total cost by this quantity.

Given that 2 pumps yield 120 washings, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we can infer that the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps:

$$\frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 10 \text{ cents per pump}$$

Therefore, the cost per pump of the shampoo is 10 cents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and subtract it from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt:
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 \* $25 = $7.50

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt:
Discounted price of the shirt = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
Total cost = Discounted price of the shirt + Price of the shorts
Total cost = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we don't need to calculate it separately.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Joe will have left:
Amount left = Initial amount - Total cost
Amount left = $50 - $52.50 = -$2.50

Since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Joe does not have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: $-2.50"
"To determine the amount of butter needed to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants. Since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, we can multiply the number of dozen croissants by 12.

Let's denote the number of dozen croissants as $d$. Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days, the total number of croissants is given by:

$$\text{Total Croissants} = d \times 12 \times 7$$

Substituting $d = 4$, we get:

$$\text{Total Croissants} = 4 \times 12 \times 7 = 336$$

Now, we need to find the total amount of butter needed. It takes $\frac{1}{4}$ pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, we can multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter per dozen:

$$\text{Total Butter} = 336 \times \frac{1}{4}$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$\text{Total Butter} = 336 \times \frac{1}{4} = 84$$

Therefore, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the cost difference in repaving Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

The cost per meter to repave a street is $194. Monica's street is 150 meters long, and Lewis' street is 490 meters long.

First, let's calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:

Cost to repave Monica's street = Cost per meter × Length of Monica's street
= $194 × 150
= $29,100

Next, we'll calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:

Cost to repave Lewis' street = Cost per meter × Length of Lewis' street
= $194 × 490
= $95,060

Now, we'll find the difference in the cost to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street:

Difference in cost = Cost to repave Lewis' street - Cost to repave Monica's street
= $95,060 - $29,100
= $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial funding for the first 5 months and the increased funding for the remaining 45 months.

Let's denote the initial funding as $100,000. Since the research took 10 times longer than expected, the total duration of the research is 5 + 10 = 15 months. However, the first 5 months are already accounted for, so we need to consider the remaining 10 months.

The funding for the remaining 10 months is 50% more than the initial funding. This can be expressed as 1.5 times the initial funding, or 1.5 * $100,000 = $150,000 per month.

The total cost for the remaining 10 months is $150,000 * 10 = $1,500,000.

To find the total cost of the research, we add the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 10 months:
$100,000 + $1,500,000 = $1,600,000.

However, this is not the correct answer. The problem states that the research took 10 times longer than expected, which means the total duration is 10 times the initial 5 months, or 10 * 5 = 50 months. The first 5 months are already accounted for, so we need to consider the remaining 45 months.

The correct total cost for the remaining 45 months is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 45 months:
$100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

The final answer is: $6,850,000"
"To determine the total amount of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to calculate the amount eaten by each player. 

The first player consumed 6 ounces of steak. 

The second player ate 8 beef tips, each weighing 1 ounce, so the total amount of beef tips consumed is 8 ounces.

The third player consumed a 1-pound steak, which is equivalent to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

Now, let's calculate the total amount of meat consumed by adding the individual amounts: 6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total number of posts in March, we need to calculate the total number of posts per day and then multiply it by the number of days in March.

Given that there are 1000 members, each posting an average of 3 posts per day, we can calculate the total number of posts per day as follows:

Total posts per day = Number of members × Posts per member per day
= 1000 members × 3 posts/member
= 3000 posts/day

Since March has 31 days, we can find the total number of posts in March by multiplying the total number of posts per day by the number of days in March:

Total posts in March = Total posts per day × Number of days in March
= 3000 posts/day × 31 days
= 93,000 posts

Therefore, the total number of posts in March is 93,000."
"To determine the annual cost of water for laundry, we need to calculate the total amount of water used in a year and then multiply it by the cost of a gallon of water.

Gary does laundry twice a week, which translates to 2 loads per week. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads done in a year is 2 * 52 = 104 loads.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water. Therefore, the total amount of water used in a year is 104 loads * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons.

The cost of a gallon of water is $0.15. To find the total cost, we multiply the total gallons used by the cost per gallon: 2080 gallons * $0.15/gallon = $312.

The final answer is: $312"
"To calculate the total amount Scarlett spent, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the items she purchased:

- The aquarium costs $10.00.
- The cost of 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each is 2 × $2.50 = $5.00.
- The cost of 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each is 3 × $2.00 = $6.00.
- The cost of 20 fish at $0.50 each is 20 × $0.50 = $10.00.
- The cost of fish food is $2.00.

Now, let's add the costs together:
$10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00

The final answer is: $33.00"
"To determine the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we can apply a step-by-step approach using basic arithmetic operations.

First, we note that the initial height of the beanstalk is 3 inches. 

In the second week, the beanstalk doubles in height, which can be represented as a multiplication operation: 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

Next, in the third week, the beanstalk grows an additional 4 inches. To find the total height, we add this growth to the height at the end of the second week: 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

Therefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat he sells in a day and then divide the total weight of the bull's meat by that amount.

Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so the amount of meat he sells per day can be calculated as follows:

m = 15 kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150 kg/day

Now, we can divide the total weight of the bull's meat by the amount of meat Prince sells per day to find the number of days it will take to sell the meat:

t = 750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of students in the school auditorium, we first calculate the total number of seats available. Given that there are 4 rows of seats with 18 seats in each row, we can express this as a simple multiplication problem.

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 4 * 18 = 72 seats

Next, we need to find the number of seats occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we can express this as a fraction of the total number of seats.

Administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Now, we need to find the number of remaining seats after the administrators have occupied their seats. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats.

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

Next, we need to find the number of seats occupied by the parents. Since one-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, we can express this as a fraction of the remaining seats.

Parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Finally, we can find the number of students by subtracting the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats.

Students = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the total number of functioning street lights, we must first calculate the total number of street lights and then subtract the number of non-functioning lights.

Given that each pole has 4 street lights and there are 6 poles at each intersection, the total number of poles is 6 * 4 = 24. Since each pole has 4 street lights, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

However, 20 street lights are not functioning. Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is 96 - 20 = 76.

The final answer is: 76"
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining number of plays for each DVD and then sum those values.

Let's denote the number of times DVD 1 can be played as $P_1$ and the number of times DVD 2 can be played as $P_2$. We know that each DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks. Therefore, we have:

$P_1 = 1000 - 356 = 644$

$P_2 = 1000 - 135 = 865$

Now, we can find the total number of times both DVDs can be played by adding $P_1$ and $P_2$:

$P_{total} = P_1 + P_2 = 644 + 865 = 1509$

The final answer is: $\boxed{1509}$"
"To determine the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours he attended physical therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

Let's break down the information provided:

- John attended physical therapy for 6 weeks.
- He went to physical therapy twice a week.
- Each session lasted for 2 hours.

To find the total number of hours, we can use the formula:

Total hours = Number of weeks * Number of sessions per week * Hours per session
Total hours = 6 weeks * 2 sessions/week * 2 hours/session
Total hours = 24 hours

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total hours by the cost per hour:

Cost per hour = $125
Total cost = Total hours * Cost per hour
Total cost = 24 hours * $125/hour
Total cost = $3000

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000."
"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews and subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's find out how many pieces Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours and the school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of pieces chewed at school = 8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces

In addition to the pieces chewed at school, Jim also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, for a total of 2 more pieces.

Total pieces chewed = 4 (at school) + 2 (on the way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces

Now, let's subtract the total pieces chewed from the initial amount of gum:

Initial amount of gum = 20 pieces
Total pieces chewed = 6 pieces
Remaining gum = Initial amount - Total pieces chewed = 20 - 6 = 14 pieces

However, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. To find out how many pieces he gives her, we need to divide the remaining gum by 2:

Remaining gum = 14 pieces
Pieces given to sister = Remaining gum / 2 = 14 / 2 = 7 pieces

Now, we subtract the pieces given to his sister from the remaining gum:

Pieces left = Remaining gum - Pieces given to sister = 14 - 7 = 7 pieces

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we need to calculate her current age first. Since she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can use a simple subtraction to find her current age.

Let's denote Charmaine's current age as 'x'. We know that in 12 years, she will be 16 years old. This can be represented as:

x + 12 = 16

To find 'x', we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

x = 16 - 12
x = 4

Now that we know Charmaine's current age is 4, we can find her age 4 years from now by adding 4 to her current age:

Age 4 years from now = x + 4
Age 4 years from now = 4 + 4
Age 4 years from now = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the difference in the amounts spent by the two coaches, we need to calculate the total expenditures for each.

The baseball coach purchased 9 baseballs at $3 each, so the total expenditure can be calculated as follows:

9 \* 3 = $27

The basketball coach, on the other hand, bought 8 basketballs at $14 each, resulting in a total expenditure of:

8 \* 14 = $112

Now, to find the difference between the two amounts, we subtract the baseball coach's expenditure from the basketball coach's expenditure:

112 - 27 = $85

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To determine the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden, we first calculate the total number of flowers. Given that there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, the total number of flowers is the product of these two quantities.

Total flowers = 10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 10 * 20 = 200 flowers

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we can find the number of bloomed flowers by multiplying the total number of flowers by 4/5.

Number of bloomed flowers = (4/5) * 200 = (4 * 200) / 5 = 800 / 5 = 160

Therefore, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to perform a series of conversions.

First, we convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s. Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can express this as a conversion factor:

$$\frac{1 \text{ Mb}}{1000 \text{ kb}}$$

We can then use this conversion factor to convert Ashley's speed from kb/s to Mb/s:

$$20 \text{ kb/s} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ Mb}}{1000 \text{ kb}} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s}$$

Next, we need to convert her speed from Mb/s to Mb/hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we can multiply her speed in Mb/s by 3600:

$$0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \cdot 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h}$$

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb/h.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the truck, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the number of cars towed on the first three days and the number of cars towed on the remaining days.

Let's denote the number of cars towed on each of the first three days as $n$. Since the truck towed 10 cars on each of these days, we have $n = 10$.

The number of cars towed on the remaining days is 7 - 3 = 4 days. Since 4 fewer cars were towed on each of these days, the number of cars towed on each of these days is $10 - 4 = 6$. So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is $6 \times 4 = 24$.

Now, we can find the total number of cars towed by adding the number of cars towed on the first three days and the number of cars towed on the remaining days: $10 \times 3 + 24 = 30 + 24 = 54$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Adam to reach the required height, we need to calculate the difference between the required height and his current height, and then divide by his annual growth rate.

Let's denote the required height as \(H_r = 4 \text{ feet} = 48 \text{ inches}\) and Adam's current height as \(H_c = 40 \text{ inches}\). His growth rate is given as 2 inches per year.

The difference in height is calculated as:
\[H_r - H_c = 48 - 40 = 8 \text{ inches}\]

To find the number of years it will take for Adam to reach the required height, we divide the difference in height by his growth rate:
\[t = \frac{H_r - H_c}{\text{growth rate}} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ years}\]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to reach the required height to ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine James' earnings, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars and then calculate his commission on that profit.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars: 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000.

Next, we need to calculate the company's cost to acquire the cars, which is 30% of the total cost. This can be expressed as:

Company's cost = 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000

Now, we can calculate the profit from selling the cars by subtracting the company's cost from the total cost:

Profit = Total cost - Company's cost
= $250,000 - $75,000
= $175,000

Finally, we need to calculate James' commission on the profit, which is 10% of the profit:

Commission = 0.1 * $175,000
= $17,500

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To determine the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright. Given that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we can express this as a decimal and multiply:

25% = 0.25

Now, we multiply 0.25 by 100 to find the total number of riders who can stay upright:

0.25 × 100 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we can express this as a decimal and multiply:

60% = 0.6

Now, we multiply 0.6 by 25 to find the number of women who can stay upright:

0.6 × 25 = 15

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Given that the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000, we can determine the price of the gold Jewell by applying the ratio of their prices. The price of the gold Jewell is 4/5 times the price of the diamond Jewell, which can be expressed as:

Price of gold Jewell = (4/5) × Price of diamond Jewell
= (4/5) × $2000
= $1600

Next, we are given that the cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold. This relationship can be expressed as:

Price of silver Jewell = Price of gold Jewell - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

To find the total price for all three jewels, we can add the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond Jewell + Price of gold Jewell + Price of silver Jewell
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of truck and rose stamps. 

Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R. We are given that S = 16.

We know that Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so T = S + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19.

We also know that he bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so R = T - 9 = 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps Max bought by adding the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps: S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

"Given that Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, who is driving at a speed of 70 miles per hour, while Bob is driving at a speed of 55 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob.

To find the time, we need to determine the relative speed between them. This is calculated as the difference between their speeds, which is 70 mph (Tom's speed) - 55 mph (Bob's speed) = 15 mph.

The distance between them is 75 miles. Using the formula Time = Distance / Relative Speed, we can calculate the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob.

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph

Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"Given that Naomi caught 17 fish, we can determine the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from Naomi's total. This is a straightforward application of the concept of subtraction, where we are essentially finding the difference between two quantities.

Let's denote the number of fish Darren caught as D. We can express this relationship as:

D = 17 - 6

D = 11

Now, we need to find the number of fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can express this relationship as:

T = D + 3

Substituting the value of D, we get:

T = 11 + 3

T = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny attends at $6 per class as x and the number of classes he attends at $10 per class as y. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

We can set up the equation:

6x + 10y = 60

Since Manny can't attend a fraction of a class, we need to find the maximum whole number of classes he can attend at $6 per class.

We can start by trying different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

Let's try x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.

If x = 10, 6(10) + 10y = 60
60 + 10y = 60
10y = 0
y = 0

If x = 9, 6(9) + 10y = 60
54 + 10y = 60
10y = 6
y = 0.6 (not a whole number)

If x = 8, 6(8) + 10y = 60
48 + 10y = 60
10y = 12
y = 1.2 (not a whole number)

If x = 7, 6(7) + 10y = 60
42 + 10y = 60
10y = 18
y = 1.8 (not a whole number)

If x = 6, 6(6) + 10y = 60
36 + 10y = 60
10y = 24
y = 2.4 (not a whole number)

If x = 5, 6(5) + 10y = 60
30 + 10y = 60
10y = 30
y = 3

If x = 4, 6(4) + 10y = 60
24 + 10y = 60
10y = 36
y = 3.6 (not a whole number)

If x = 3, 6(3) + 10y = 60
18 + 10y = 60
10y = 42
y = 4.2 (not a whole number)

If x = 2, 6(2) + 10y = 60
12 + 10y = 60
10y = 48
y = 4.8 (not a whole number)

If x = 1, 6(1) + 10y = 60
6 + 10y = 60
10y = 54
y = 5.4 (not a whole number)

If x = 0, 6(0) + 10y = 60
0 + 10y = 60
10y = 60
y = 6

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to calculate their individual daily and weekly production rates.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is given by the formula:

Weekly Production = Daily Production * Number of Working Days
= 50 * 7
= 350 customers

Now, we need to find Julie's production rate. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, her daily production rate is twice that of Jewel's:

Julie's Daily Production = 2 * Jewel's Daily Production
= 2 * 50
= 100 customers

Julie's weekly production is then calculated as:

Julie's Weekly Production = Julie's Daily Production * Number of Working Days
= 100 * 7
= 700 customers

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions:

Total Weekly Production = Jewel's Weekly Production + Julie's Weekly Production
= 350 + 700
= 1050 customers

The final answer is: $\boxed{1050}$"
"To determine the distance Lynn ran, we need to establish the relationship between the distances covered by Reggie, Lynn, and Paisley.

Let's denote the distance Lynn ran as L, the distance Reggie ran as R, and the distance Paisley ran as P. We are given that Paisley ran 4 miles, so P = 4.

We are also given that Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which can be expressed as R = 5P. Substituting the value of P, we get R = 5(4) = 20 miles.

Furthermore, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, which can be expressed as R = L + 3. Substituting the value of R, we get 20 = L + 3.

To find the distance Lynn ran, we need to solve for L. Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation, we get L = 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to establish the unit prices of each fruit. 

The unit price of an apple is the cost of 4 apples divided by 4, which is $5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30 per apple. 

The unit price of an orange is the cost of 3 oranges divided by 3, which is $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10 per orange.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 5 apples by multiplying the unit price of an apple by 5: $1.30 * 5 = $6.50.

Similarly, we can calculate the total cost of 5 oranges by multiplying the unit price of an orange by 5: $1.10 * 5 = $5.50.

The total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges is the sum of their individual costs: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the hole, is given by the formula:

V = lwh

where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth) of the prism.

Given that the length (l) is 6 feet, the width (w) is 4 feet, and the depth (h) is 3 feet, we can calculate the volume as follows:

V = lwh
= (6)(4)(3)
= 72 cubic feet

Now, we are given that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. To find the total time it will take him to dig the hole, we multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

Time = V * time per cubic foot
= 72 * 3
= 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

The final answer is: $\boxed{216}$"
"To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $\frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To determine Tim's total annual income, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary. This can be expressed as a mathematical operation:

New monthly salary = $20,000 + (0.05 * $20,000)
= $20,000 + $1,000
= $21,000

Alternatively, we can express this as a single mathematical expression:

New monthly salary = $20,000 + 0.05 * $20,000
= $20,000 + $1,000
= $21,000

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary:

Bonus = $20,000 / 2
= $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly income:

Total monthly income = New monthly salary + Bonus
= $21,000 + $10,000
= $31,000

Finally, let's calculate the total annual income:

Total annual income = Total monthly income * 12
= $31,000 * 12
= $372,000

"To determine the total cost of James' wardrobe, we need to calculate the cost of each item and sum them up.

First, let's find the cost of the suits: 10 suits * $750 = $7500.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the dress pants. Since they cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit, we can express this as (1/5) * $750 = $150 per dress pant. Therefore, the total cost of the dress pants is 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 shirts per suit, so the total number of shirts is 10 suits * 3 shirts/suit = 30 shirts. The cost of the dress shirts is 30 shirts * $60 = $1800.

To find the total cost, we add up the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to consider the average daily output of each website and the total number of days in the month.

The news website publishes an average of 20 articles per day, and its sister company publishes an average of 10 articles per day. Given that February has 28 days, we can calculate the total number of articles published by each website as follows:

Total articles published by the news website = 20 articles/day * 28 days
= 20 * 28
= 560 articles

Total articles published by the sister company = 10 articles/day * 28 days
= 10 * 28
= 280 articles

Now, we can find the total number of articles published by both websites by adding the individual totals:
Total articles = 560 articles (news website) + 280 articles (sister company)
= 840 articles

The final answer is: 840"
"Given the problem, we can break it down step by step using basic algebra and arithmetic operations.

Let's denote Steve's age as S, his wife's age as W, their son's age as C, and their son's wife's age as SW.

We are given that S = 60, W = S + 4, and C = W / 2.

Substituting the value of W, we get C = (S + 4) / 2 = (60 + 4) / 2 = 64 / 2 = 32.

Now, we are given that SW = C - 3.

Substituting the value of C, we get SW = 32 - 3 = 29.

Therefore, the age of Steve's son's wife is 29.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we can apply basic principles of arithmetic operations. 

Given that each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion: 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we can then multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To calculate the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we can use the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time.

Alisa's distance = speed × time = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles.

Stanley's distance = speed × time = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles.

The total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley is the sum of their individual distances: 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles.

The final answer is: 79"
"To determine the time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add them together.

Let's start by calculating the time it takes to dig through the soil. We know that Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil. To find the time, we divide the total depth of the soil by the rate at which he digs through it:

Time to dig through soil = Total depth of soil / Rate of digging through soil
= 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
= 6 hours

Next, we calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. We know that Bill digs half as fast through clay as he does through soil, so his rate of digging through clay is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour. To find the time, we divide the total depth of the clay by the rate at which he digs through it:

Time to dig through clay = Total depth of clay / Rate of digging through clay
= 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
= 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to find the total time:

Total time to dig the well = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
= 6 hours + 4 hours
= 10 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of individuals in his class, including himself, his teacher, and his classmates. This can be represented as the sum of the number of classmates and the additional individuals (Howie and his teacher).

Let's denote the number of classmates as C. We know that C = 25. Therefore, the total number of individuals is C + 2 (Howie and his teacher).

Total number of individuals = C + 2
Total number of individuals = 25 + 2
Total number of individuals = 27

Since Howie wants to get one of each flavor (vanilla and chocolate) for each person, we need to multiply the total number of individuals by 2.

Total number of cupcakes = 2 * (C + 2)
Total number of cupcakes = 2 * 27
Total number of cupcakes = 54

Therefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

The final answer is: 54"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Given that Fishio received 2000 likes initially, we can denote the number of likes after 1 week as L1 = 2000. 

Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. This can be expressed as L2 = 70L1 = 70(2000) = 140000.

However, we are not given the number of likes received in the 3-week period. Instead, we are given that she received 20000 more new likes recently. To find the total number of likes after this additional increase, we need to determine the number of likes after the 3-week period, which is L2 = 140000.

The number of likes received in the 3-week period can be found by subtracting the initial number of likes from the number of likes after 3 weeks: L3 = L2 - L1 = 140000 - 2000 = 138000.

Now, we add the 20000 new likes to the total number of likes after 3 weeks: L_total = L2 + 20000 = 140000 + 20000 = 160000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160000}$"
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two costs.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off because she had a voucher. The total cost is given by the expression:

Total Cost = (Number of Pomegranates) × (Price per Pomegranate) - Discount
= 20 × $20 - $2
= $398

On the second day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost without the discount is:

Total Cost = Number of Pomegranates × Price per Pomegranate
= 20 × $30
= $600

The discount is 10% of $600, which is:

Discount = 0.1 × $600
= $60

So, the total cost with the discount is:

Total Cost = Total Cost without Discount - Discount
= $600 - $60
= $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

Difference = Total Cost on the Second Day - Total Cost on the First Day
= $540 - $398
= $142

The final answer is: $142"
"Given the scenario, let's analyze the sales data for Ariadne's shop.

Let's denote the total sales from green hats in the first month as $x. Since the sales from red hats in the first month are half the total sales from green hats, we can express this as:

$$\frac{1}{2}x = 400$$

To find the value of x, we multiply both sides by 2:

$$x = 400 \times 2 = 800$$

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month are $800, and from red hats are $400.

The total sales in the first month are the sum of the sales from green and red hats:

$$\text{Total Sales (First Month)} = 800 + 400 = 1200$$

In the second month, the sales are 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:

$$\text{Sales (Second Month)} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900$$

To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months:

$$\text{Total Sales (Two Months)} = 1200 + 900 = 2100$$

The final answer is: $2100"
"To determine the total cost of hiring the horse-drawn carriage, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the total cost of those hours.

Let's denote the number of paid hours as $n$. Since James gets 1 hour free, the total duration of the carriage rental is 4 hours, and the number of paid hours is $n = 4 - 1 = 3$.

The cost of the first hour is $15, and each subsequent hour costs twice the cost of the first hour, which is $2 \times 15 = 30$.

The total cost can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

$$\text{Total Cost} = 15 + 30 + 30 = 75$$

Therefore, the total cost of hiring the horse-drawn carriage is $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we can calculate the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount she received.

Let's denote Sally's expected wage as W = $300 and the initial amount in her account as A = $200. The expected total amount in her account, if she received her full wage, would be the sum of her initial amount and her expected wage: A + W = $200 + $300 = $500.

Since Sally actually has $420 in her account, we can find the difference between the expected total and the actual amount to determine the amount withheld.

Amount withheld = (A + W) - Actual amount
= $500 - $420
= $80

Therefore, the amount withheld from Sally's wage is $80."
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Lori needs, we must first calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required for her guests. Given that each guest will consume 3 deviled egg halves, and she is inviting 16 guests, we can find the total number of deviled egg halves as follows:

Total deviled egg halves = Number of guests × Number of deviled egg halves per guest
= 16 × 3
= 48

Since each whole egg yields 2 deviled egg halves, we can calculate the number of eggs needed by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2:

Number of eggs = Total deviled egg halves ÷ Number of deviled egg halves per egg
= 48 ÷ 2
= 24

To find the number of dozens of eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen:

Number of dozens of eggs = Number of eggs ÷ Number of eggs in a dozen
= 24 ÷ 12
= 2

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs for her party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we can use the concept of fractions. Since she has completed 1/3 of the paper, we can find the number of pages left by subtracting the completed portion from the total.

Let's denote the total number of pages as T. We know that Shiela has completed 1/3 of the paper, so the number of pages completed is (1/3)T. To find the number of pages left, we subtract this from the total:

Pages left = T - (1/3)T
Pages left = (2/3)T

Given that the total number of pages is 15, we can substitute T = 15 into the equation:

Pages left = (2/3)(15)
Pages left = 2 * 5
Pages left = 10

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the number of days before the deadline that Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the time it will take him to complete the book.

Given:
- Total pages in the book: 200
- Pages read per day: 10

We can calculate the number of days it will take Mike to finish the book by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day.

Days to finish the book = Total pages / Pages read per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we can find the number of days before the deadline by subtracting the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the total number of days.

Days before the deadline = Total days - Days to finish the book
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase price, the monthly hanger rental, and the fuel expenses.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly hanger rental is $5,000. To find the total hanger rental cost for a year, we multiply this by 12, the number of months in a year: $5,000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, so it is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. To find the total fuel cost for a year, we multiply this by 12: $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, we add the initial purchase price, the hanger rental cost, and the fuel cost to find the total cost for the first year: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To determine the total cooking time for Finley's meal, we need to calculate the time it takes to cook each component and then sum these values.

Let's denote the time it takes to cook rice as $r$, the time to cook pork as $p$, and the time to cook beans as $b$. We are given that $r = 30$ minutes.

We also know that it takes Finley 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so we can express the time to cook pork as $p = r + 20$. Substituting the given value for $r$, we get $p = 30 + 20 = 50$ minutes.

The time to cook beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is $r + p = 30 + 50 = 80$ minutes. Therefore, the time to cook beans is $b = \frac{1}{2}(r + p) = \frac{1}{2}(80) = 40$ minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total cooking time by summing the individual cooking times: $t = r + p + b = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120$ minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost difference between two mixtures of nuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

Let's denote the cost of almonds as $A and the cost of walnuts as $W. We are given that A = $10/pound and W = $15/pound.

For the first mixture, we have 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts. The total cost of this mixture is given by:

C1 = (1/2)A + (1/3)W
C1 = (1/2)($10) + (1/3)($15)
C1 = $5 + $5
C1 = $10

For the second mixture, we have 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts. The total cost of this mixture is given by:

C2 = (1/5)A + (1/3)W
C2 = (1/5)($10) + (1/3)($15)
C2 = $2 + $5
C2 = $7

Now, we can find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

ΔC = C1 - C2
ΔC = $10 - $7
ΔC = $3

The final answer is: $3"
"Given the problem, we can establish two equations based on the information provided:

Let S be the number of sheep and G be the number of geese.

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4S + 2G = 70.

Since each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, the total number of heads can be represented as S + G = 20.

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Substituting G = 20 - S into the first equation, we get 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of Roger's purchase, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but since his favorite brand was sold out, he had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we can calculate 20% of $5 and add it to the original price.

20% of $5 is calculated as 0.20 * $5 = $1. 

Therefore, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week. The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

The cost of the donut is $2.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the coffee and the donut: $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Gus purchased and then subtract that amount from the $20.00 he spent.

The total cost of the items can be calculated as follows:

2 bags of chips at $2.00 each = 2 × $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken: $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00
Adding the cost of the bottle of soda: $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items from the $20.00 Gus spent:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is $7.00."
"To determine the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we can utilize a simple arithmetic operation. Given that James delivers 600 newspapers in total, and we know the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C, we can subtract the sum of these two values from the total to find the number of newspapers delivered to District B.

Let's denote the number of newspapers delivered to District B as x. We can express this as an equation:

x = 600 - (198 + 209)

To solve for x, we first evaluate the expression within the parentheses:

198 + 209 = 407

Now, we can rewrite the equation as:

x = 600 - 407

To find the value of x, we perform the subtraction:

x = 600 - 407
x = 193

Therefore, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine the number of recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total class time and then divide it by the time it takes to learn a new recipe.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total class time per week is 4 × 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class lasts for 6 weeks, the total class time is 8 × 6 = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, so the total number of recipes he learns is 48 ÷ 1.5 = 32.

"To find the number of math teachers, we first need to determine the proportion of teachers that are not history teachers. Since 60% of the teachers are history teachers, the remaining 40% must be math teachers. We can express this as a percentage and convert it to a decimal to calculate the number of math teachers:

Number of math teachers = 40% of 150
= 0.4 * 150
= 0.4 * 150
= 60

Now, we can find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day by multiplying the number of math teachers by the hours slept per day:

Total time = Number of math teachers * Hours slept per day
= 60 * 6
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"Given the scenario, we can establish the relationships between the amounts of money each person has. Let's denote Aurelia's money as A, Kassidy's money as K, and Rayna's money as R.

We are given that Aurelia has $120, so A = 120.

We are also given that Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, which can be expressed as K = (3/4)A. Substituting the value of A, we get K = (3/4)(120) = 90.

Furthermore, we know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, which can be expressed as R = K + 60. Substituting the value of K, we get R = 90 + 60 = 150.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they have together and divide it by 3 to determine how much each person would have if they shared it equally. The total amount of money is A + K + R = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360.

To find the amount each person would have, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 ÷ 3 = 120.

Therefore, each person would have $120 if they decided to add their money together and share it equally.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the total length of the game, we need to calculate the sum of the lengths of the four regular quarters and the extra five minutes.

The length of each quarter is given as 12 minutes. Since there are four quarters, we can calculate their total length as follows:

"Given the problem, let's analyze the situation step by step.

We know that Christina records her mood every day on a calendar for thirty days. The distribution of her moods is as follows:

- The first 8 days were good.
- The next 8 days were bad.
- The next 8 days were neutral.
- The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

We are asked to find the number of good days left in the month, given that Christina had 12 good days in total.

Let's denote the number of good days in the first 8 days as G1, the number of good days in the last 3 days as G2, and the number of good days in the remaining days as G3. We know that G1 = 8 and G2 = 2.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of good days: G1 + G2 + G3 = 12.

Substituting the known values, we get 8 + 2 + G3 = 12.

Solving for G3, we get G3 = 12 - 8 - 2 = 2.

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Given that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has, and Janey has 21 books, we can express this relationship as an equation:

2x + 3 = 21

where 'x' represents the number of books Sally has. To solve for 'x', we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to isolate 'x':

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we first need to establish the initial height in inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the initial height of 20 feet to inches as follows:

20 feet × 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Next, we calculate the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we can use the growth rate of 30 inches per day to find the number of days required to reach the target height:

Let x be the number of days. Then, the equation representing the situation is:

30x = 360

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 30:

x = 360 / 30
x = 12

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step, applying mathematical principles to determine the total number of toys James needs.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, indicating a 1:1 ratio of toys to dogs. This means each dog has one toy. When 8 more dogs arrive, James needs 8 additional toys to maintain the 1:1 ratio.

The initial number of toys needed is 4 (initial toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys.

When James returns, the number of dogs has doubled, from 8 to 16, resulting in a total of 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (initial additional dogs) + 16 (new dogs) = 28 dogs. To maintain the 1:1 ratio, James needs 28 more toys.

The total number of toys needed so far is 12 (initial toys) + 28 (additional toys) = 40 toys.

However, when James returns again, 3 dogs are gone, reducing the total number of dogs to 28 - 3 = 25 dogs. Since each dog requires one toy, James no longer needs 3 toys.

The final number of toys needed is 40 (total toys needed so far) - 3 (toys no longer needed) = 37 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{37}$"
"To determine the amount invested by Skyler, we'll break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate Dylan's investment, which is 2/5 of the total amount invested, $1200.

Dylan's investment = (2/5) * 1200
Dylan's investment = 480

Now, we'll find the remaining amount after Dylan's investment.

Remaining amount = Total amount - Dylan's investment
Remaining amount = 1200 - 480
Remaining amount = 720

Next, we'll calculate Frances' investment, which is 2/3 of the remaining amount.

Frances' investment = (2/3) * 720
Frances' investment = 480

Now, we'll find the remaining amount after Frances' investment.

Remaining amount = 720 - 480
Remaining amount = 240

This remaining amount is Skyler's investment.

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the number of signatures the sisters need to collect, we first calculate the total number of signatures they have so far. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures.

Total signatures so far = 20 + 44 = 64

The sisters want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find the number of signatures they need to collect, we subtract the total signatures they have from their goal.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36

Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, we can calculate the number of signatures they need to collect per week to reach their goal.

Signatures needed per week = 36 / 3 = 12

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 12 signatures per week for the remaining three weeks to reach their goal of 100 signatures.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine Karen's earnings in two days, we first need to establish her hourly wage. Given that she earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, we can calculate Karen's hourly wage as 2 * $10 = $20.

Next, we calculate the total hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, her total hours worked in two days is 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate Karen's earnings in two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the total hours worked: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can establish a ratio of potatoes to hash browns. Given that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns, we can express this relationship as a proportion.

Let's set up the proportion:

$$\frac{6\ \text{potatoes}}{36\ \text{hash browns}} = \frac{96\ \text{potatoes}}{x\ \text{hash browns}}$$

To solve for $x$, we can cross-multiply:

$$6x = 96 \cdot 36$$

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

$$6x = 3456$$

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

$$x = \frac{3456}{6}$$

$$x = 576$$

Therefore, 96 potatoes can be used to make 576 hash browns.

The final answer is: $\boxed{576}$"
"To determine the excess weight, we need to calculate the total weight of the 9 adults and then subtract the maximum load of the elevator.

Let's denote the weight of one adult as $w_a$ and the number of adults as $n$. Given that $w_a = 80$ kg and $n = 9$, we can calculate the total weight of the adults as follows:

Total weight of adults = $w_a \cdot n = 80 \cdot 9 = 720$ kg

The maximum load of the elevator is given as 700 kg. To find the excess weight, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight of the adults:

Excess weight = Total weight of adults - Maximum load
Excess weight = $720$ kg $- 700$ kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

Therefore, the excess weight is 20 kg.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

Let's start by identifying the number of cookies Katarina has, which is given as 68. 

We know that Max has 5 more cookies than Katarina, so we can express the number of cookies Max has as 68 + 5 = 73.

The Cookie Monster has 12 less cookies than Max, so the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has can be expressed as 73 - 12 = 61.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so the number of cookies Summer has can be expressed as 73 + 23 = 96.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding up the number of cookies each person has: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96.

68 + 73 = 141
141 + 61 = 202
202 + 96 = 298

The total number of cookies is 298."
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to consider the total added length. The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, and then 20cm was added. Let's denote the original length as 'x'. 

The extension is 50% of x, which is 0.5x. Adding 20cm to this extension gives us 0.5x + 20.

The final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: x + (0.5x + 20) = 140.

Combine like terms: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 1.5x = 120.

Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to consider the time it took for each mode and then add them together.

Let's denote the time it took to mow the lawn in turtle mode as $t_{turtle}$ and the time it took to mow the lawn in rabbit mode as $t_{rabbit}$. We know that $t_{turtle} = 60$ minutes and $t_{rabbit} = 40$ minutes.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we can express this as a ratio of the total time: $\frac{t_{turtle}}{t_{total}} = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{t_{rabbit}}{t_{total}} = \frac{1}{2}$.

We can solve for $t_{total}$ by adding the two equations: $\frac{t_{turtle}}{t_{total}} + \frac{t_{rabbit}}{t_{total}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$. This implies that $t_{turtle} + t_{rabbit} = t_{total}$.

Substituting the given values, we get $60 + 40 = t_{total}$.

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is $t_{total} = 100$ minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the remaining time for John and Jack to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the time elapsed to reach the fire station and subtract it from the total time available.

The time taken to get to the fire station is the sum of the time taken to get to the corner where the library is and the time taken to get to the fire station from there. 

Time taken to get to the fire station = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Now, we subtract the time taken to get to the fire station from the total time available to find the remaining time.

Remaining time = Total time available - Time taken to get to the fire station
Remaining time = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Remaining time = 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes to get to school without being late.

The final answer is: 11"
"To calculate the total amount Catherine paid, we need to apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

1 kilo of apples costs $4.
2 kilos of bananas cost 2 * $2 = $4.
2 kilos of oranges cost 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14.

This can also be represented as a mathematical expression: 4 + 4 + 6 = 14.

Therefore, the total amount Catherine paid is $14."
"To determine the number of cookies in the box, we need to calculate the total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda, and then subtract the number of cookies they consumed.

Let's denote the number of cookies Greta bakes as G and the number of cookies Celinda bakes as C. We are given that Greta bakes 30 cookies, so G = 30. We are also given that Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, so C = 2G = 2(30) = 60.

The total number of cookies is the sum of the cookies baked by Greta and Celinda, which is G + C = 30 + 60 = 90.

Now, we need to subtract the number of cookies they consumed, which is 10. Therefore, the number of cookies left in the box is 90 - 10 = 80.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

We have two equations based on the given information:

1. The sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44: T + (T+7) + t = 44
2. The older twin is 7 years older than the triplet: T+7 = t+7

We can simplify the second equation to find the relationship between T and t: T = t

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3t = 37

Divide by 3: t = 37/3

Simplify the fraction: t = 12.33

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, the problem asks for the age of one of the twins, and since we have two twins, we need to find the age of the older twin.

The age of the older twin is T+7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"
"To determine the time John has available for a nap, we must first calculate the total time he has before dinner and then subtract the time spent on homework.

The time before dinner is given as 3 hours. To convert this to minutes, we use the conversion factor of 1 hour = 60 minutes. Therefore, 3 hours = 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on homework. John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. The total time spent on homework is the sum of these individual times: 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find the time available for a nap: 180 - 80 = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes available for a nap."
"To determine the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

Let's denote the cost of one lollipop as L and the cost of one candy as C. We are given that L = $0.40 and the total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20. 

We can express this as an equation: 5L + 4C = 3.20. Substituting the value of L, we get 5(0.40) + 4C = 3.20. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 2.00 + 4C = 3.20. Subtracting 2.00 from both sides, we get 4C = 1.20. 

Dividing both sides by 4, we get C = 0.30. 

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10L = 10(0.40) = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10C = 10(0.30) = $3.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Let's denote Rong's monthly savings as R = 20 coins. Since Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, we can express Neil's monthly savings as N = R + (2/5)R = 20 + (2/5)(20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: R * 12 = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: N * 12 = 28 * 12 = 336 coins

To find their total savings after 10 years, we multiply their annual savings by 10:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5760}$"
"To determine the amount John leaves with after visiting the vet, we need to calculate the total cost of the services provided. The cost of the vaccines is a straightforward $20 each, so 2 vaccines will be 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. The heartworm check can be expressed as 0.6x. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of its individual components. 

Let's denote the price of one apple as $0.5. Since one banana costs twice as much as an apple, its price is 2 * $0.5 = $1. The price of one orange is three times the price of a banana, which is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color of squares and add them together.

Let's denote the number of red squares as R, blue squares as B, green squares as G, and white squares as W. We are given the following information:

- R = 14
- B = R + 4
- G = B + 6
- W = G - 12

Substituting the given values, we get:
- B = 14 + 4 = 18
- G = 18 + 6 = 24
- W = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we add the number of squares of each color together:
R + B + G + W = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To determine the number of chairs Mia's restaurant needs to acquire, we must first calculate the total number of chairs required for the attendees. 

Let's denote the number of high chairs as H and the number of regular chairs as R. We are given that H = 8 and R = 5H. 

Given that there are 42 adults and 15 babies attending, the total number of chairs needed is 42 + 15 = 57.

We know that the total number of chairs available is the sum of high chairs and regular chairs, which is H + R. Since R = 5H, we can rewrite this as H + 5H = 6H. 

Substituting the given value of H = 8, we get 6H = 6(8) = 48.

Now, we can find the number of chairs needed to be added by subtracting the total number of chairs available from the total number of chairs required: 57 - 48 = 9.

Therefore, Mia's restaurant needs to acquire 9 more chairs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of 8-point bucks in the field, we first need to calculate the total number of bucks. Given that 50% of the deer are bucks, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 50 by 100, which equals 0.5. Multiplying this decimal by the total number of deer (50) yields the number of bucks: 0.5 * 50 = 25.

Next, we need to find 20% of the bucks that are 8 points. To do this, we can express 20% as a decimal by dividing 20 by 100, which equals 0.2. Multiplying this decimal by the number of bucks (25) gives us the number of 8-point bucks: 0.2 * 25 = 5.

Therefore, the number of 8-point bucks in the field is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total points collected by the class, we need to calculate the points earned by each student.

Let's start by finding Betty's points. Since she collected 30% more points than Adam, we can express this as:

Betty's points = Adam's points + (30% of Adam's points)
= 50 + (0.3 * 50)
= 50 + 15
= 65

Now, let's find Tom's points. We know that he has 30 points less than Betty, so we can express this as:

Tom's points = Betty's points - 30
= 65 - 30
= 35

Next, we'll find Martha's points. Since she collected 3 times more points than Tom, we can express this as:

Martha's points = 3 * Tom's points
= 3 * 35
= 105

Now that we have the points for each student, we can find the total points collected by the class:

Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Martha's points
= 50 + 65 + 35 + 105
= 255

To find out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold:

Points missing = Minimum threshold - Total points
= 400 - 255
= 145

The final answer is: $\boxed{145}$"
"To determine the total number of great grand-babies, we can apply the concept of exponential growth. Starting with Great Grandma Jones, we have a single individual. Each of her 3 children contributes 3 children, resulting in 3^2 = 9 grandchildren. Then, each of these 9 grandchildren contributes 3 great grand-babies, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 great grand-babies.

This can be represented using the formula for exponential growth: a^(n+1) = a^n * a, where a is the growth factor (3 in this case) and n is the number of generations (1 for the children, 2 for the grandchildren, and 3 for the great grand-babies).

Applying this formula, we get: 3^(1+2) = 3^3 = 27.

Therefore, the total number of great grand-babies is 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To determine the amount Greta has left to spend after funding her retirement account and making her car payment, we need to perform a series of calculations.

First, let's calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account. This is a straightforward application of percentage calculation. We can express this as:

Retirement Account Contribution = 0.5 × $2400.00
= $1200.00

Next, we calculate the amount she uses for her car payment. This is another percentage calculation:

Car Payment = 0.2 × $2400.00
= $480.00

Now, we subtract the amounts from her paycheck to find the remaining amount:

Remaining Amount = $2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00
= $720.00

Therefore, Greta has $720.00 left to spend after funding her retirement account and making her car payment."
"To determine the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we first need to calculate the number of pencils present in the box. Given that the box has a capacity for 20 pencils and 4 are missing, we can find the number of pencils in the box by subtracting the missing pencils from the total capacity.

Let's denote the total capacity of the box as C = 20 pencils and the number of missing pencils as M = 4. The number of pencils in the box, P, can be calculated as:

P = C - M
= 20 - 4
= 16

Now, to find the number of pairs of pencils, we need to divide the number of pencils in the box by 2, since a pair consists of 2 pencils. Let's denote the number of pairs as N. We can calculate N as:

N = P / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

Therefore, the number of pairs of pencils in the box is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is:

$$15 \times 20 = 300$$

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4:

$$0.4 \times 300 = 120$$

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks from Hannah's backyard display. She will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard display is:

$$3 \times 5 = 15$$

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display:

$$120 + 15 = 135$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"To determine the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks purchased and then multiply it by the cost per item.

First, let's find the total number of people: Aiden and his 12 friends, plus 7 more friends, equals 19 people.

Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, the total number of drinks and snacks bought is 19 * 2 (drinks) + 19 * 3 (snacks) = 38 drinks + 57 snacks = 95 items.

The cost per item is $2. So, the total amount spent on snacks and drinks is 95 items * $2 = $190.

The final answer is: $190"
"To determine the capacity of Gary's truck, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the capacity of Gary's truck as x.

We know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel, and Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which is 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

4,000 + 4,800 + x = 11,600

Combine like terms:

8,800 + x = 11,600

Subtract 8,800 from both sides:

x = 11,600 - 8,800
x = 2,800

So, the capacity of Gary's truck is 2,800 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2800}$"
"To determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we can start by calculating the total number of dumplings eaten by the group. 

Let's denote the number of dumplings each female ate as $f$. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, the number of dumplings each male ate is $f + 1$. 

We know that there are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is $6f$. Similarly, the total number of dumplings eaten by males is $8(f + 1)$.

Given that each female ate 3 dumplings, we can set up the equation $6f = 3 \cdot 6$, which simplifies to $6f = 18$. Solving for $f$, we find that $f = 3$.

Now that we know the number of dumplings each female ate, we can calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by males: $8(f + 1) = 8(3 + 1) = 8 \cdot 4 = 32$.

The total number of dumplings eaten by the group is the sum of the dumplings eaten by females and males: $6f + 8(f + 1) = 6 \cdot 3 + 8 \cdot 4 = 18 + 32 = 50$.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"Given the scenario, we can approach this problem by first determining the initial amount of money Gerald had. Since the ratio of the division is 3:2, we can express this as a fraction of the total amount, which is $100. 

Let's denote Gerald's share as 3x and Julia's share as 2x, where x is a common multiplier. Since the total amount is $100, we can set up the equation:

3x + 2x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Now that we have the value of x, we can find Gerald's initial amount by multiplying 3x:

Gerald's initial amount = 3x = 3(20) = $60

After spending $10 on a book, Gerald is left with:

Gerald's remaining amount = 60 - 10 = $50

The final answer is: $50"
"Given that Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, and the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet/second, we can determine the speed of the turtle by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we apply the formula Distance = Speed * Time.

Distance = Speed of the turtle * 40
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

Therefore, the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds is 120 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to calculate the rate at which they are raising funds. Given that they have raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, we can find the hourly rate by dividing the total amount raised by the number of hours:

$$\frac{\$2100}{3} = \$700$$

This indicates that they are raising $700 per hour. To find the total number of hours needed to reach their goal of $6300, we subtract the amount already raised from the total goal:

$$6300 - 2100 = 4200$$

Now, we divide the remaining amount by the hourly rate to find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining funds:

$$\frac{4200}{700} = 6$$

Since they have already raised money for 3 hours, we add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours to find the total number of hours:

$$6 + 3 = 9$$

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for a total of 9 hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to calculate the percentage of water used by the city and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

First, we find the percentage of water used by the city: 40% of the total water from the Colorado River.

Next, we calculate the percentage of water used for industrial purposes, which is 80% of the water used by the city. This can be expressed as 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 40% - 32% = 8%.

Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks and then multiply it by her daily rate.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks as follows:

2 weeks = 7 days/week * 2 weeks
= 7 * 2
= 14 days

Now, we can multiply the total number of days by Alex's daily rate of $12 to find the total amount she charges:

Total amount = 14 days * $12/day
= $168

Therefore, the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring is $168.

The final answer is: $168"
"To determine the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

Let's start by finding the production rate of chocolate ice cream. The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the hourly production rate, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours:

$$\frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts/hour}$$

Now, let's find the production rate of vanilla ice cream. The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the hourly production rate, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours:

$$\frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour}$$

Now that we have the production rates, we can calculate the total quarts of each type of ice cream made in 48 hours:

- Chocolate ice cream: $50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}$
- Vanilla ice cream: $12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}$

To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream:

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

- The cost of 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece is 5 × 3.00 = $15.00.
- The cost of 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each is 4 × 2.50 = $10.00.
- The cost of 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece is 3 × 4.00 = $12.00.
- The cost of 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each is 13 × 1.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the costs of all items to find the total cost before the discount: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

To apply the 10% discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.10: 0.10 × $50.00 = $5.00.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should buy, we need to consider the deal offered by the ice cream parlor. The deal states that for every 2 scoops purchased, Erin gets 1 scoop free. 

Let's denote the cost of each scoop as $1.50. Since Erin has $6.00, we can calculate the maximum number of scoops she can buy without considering the deal. 

The maximum number of scoops Erin can buy is given by the integer division of her total budget by the cost of each scoop:

$$\left\lfloor \frac{6.00}{1.50} \right\rfloor = 4$$

However, to take advantage of the deal, Erin should buy 2 scoops and get 1 free. This means she can get 3 scoops for the price of 2. 

To find out how many sets of 2 scoops Erin can buy, we can divide her budget by the cost of 2 scoops:

$$\left\lfloor \frac{6.00}{2 \times 1.50} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{6.00}{3.00} \right\rfloor = 2$$

Since Erin can buy 2 sets of 2 scoops, she will get 2 x 1 = 2 free scoops. 

In total, Erin will get 2 x 2 + 2 = 6 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of candies Amy and Ginger have after two weeks, we need to calculate their daily candy consumption and then subtract that from their initial amount.

Let's denote the initial number of candies as $I$, the daily candy consumption for Ginger as $G$, and the daily candy consumption for Amy as $A$. We are given that $I = 100$, $G = 4$, and $A = 3$. The time period is two weeks, which is equivalent to 14 days.

The total number of candies consumed by Ginger in two weeks is $G \cdot 14 = 4 \cdot 14 = 56$. Similarly, the total number of candies consumed by Amy in two weeks is $A \cdot 14 = 3 \cdot 14 = 42$.

Now, we can calculate the remaining number of candies for each person by subtracting their total consumption from the initial amount: $I - G \cdot 14$ for Ginger and $I - A \cdot 14$ for Amy.

For Ginger, the remaining number of candies is $100 - 56 = 44$. For Amy, the remaining number of candies is $100 - 42 = 58$.

To find the difference in the number of candies Amy and Ginger have, we subtract Ginger's remaining candies from Amy's remaining candies: $58 - 44 = 14$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of mosaic tiles required to cover two thirds of Mr. Boarden's 36 sq ft bathroom, we first need to calculate the area to be covered.

The area to be covered is two thirds of 36 sq ft, which can be calculated as:

(2/3) * 36 = (2 * 36) / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24 sq ft

Now, we need to find the total number of mosaic tiles required to cover this area. Since each square foot requires 24 mosaic tiles, we can multiply the area by the number of tiles per square foot:

24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 24 * 24 = 576 tiles

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

The final answer is: 576"
"To determine the amount James saved by picking blueberries, we need to calculate the cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying them at the store.

The cost of picking blueberries is comprised of an initial fixed cost of $20 and a variable cost of $1.5 per pound. Given that James picked 30 pounds of blueberries, the total cost of picking can be expressed as:

Cost of picking = Initial cost + (Variable cost per pound * Number of pounds)
= $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
= $20 + $45
= $65

The cost of buying blueberries at the store is a fixed cost of $2.5 per pound multiplied by the number of pounds picked:

Cost of buying at the store = Cost per pound * Number of pounds
= $2.5 * 30
= $75

To find the amount James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store:

Amount saved = Cost of buying at the store - Cost of picking
= $75 - $65
= $10

The final answer is: $10"
"Given that a company intended to purchase 500 computers at the initial price of $700 each, but discovered the price increase of 10% upon ordering, we can calculate the new price per computer as follows:

Let's denote the original price as $700. The price increase is 10% of $700, which can be calculated as:

10% of $700 = 0.1 × 700 = $70

The new price per computer is the sum of the original price and the price increase:

New price per computer = $700 + $70 = $770

To find the total amount the company paid for 500 computers, we multiply the new price per computer by the total number of computers:

Total amount = New price per computer × Total number of computers
= $770 × 500
= $385,000

Therefore, the total amount the company paid for the computers at the new prices is $385,000."
"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we need to consider the individual contributions from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

First, let's calculate the total calories from the eggs: 6 eggs * 75 calories per egg = 6 × 75 = 450 calories.

Next, we'll determine the calories from the cheese: 2 oz * 120 calories per oz = 2 × 120 = 240 calories.

Lastly, we'll calculate the calories from the ham: 2 oz * 40 calories per oz = 2 × 40 = 80 calories.

Now, we can sum these values to find the total calories in the omelet: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

The final answer is: 770"
"To determine the change received after purchasing 6 pencils and 8 erasers, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and subtract that from the amount paid.

The cost of a pencil is $0.50, and the cost of an eraser is $0.25. We can calculate the total cost of the pencils and erasers using the formula:

Total cost = (cost of pencils) + (cost of erasers)
= (6 * $0.50) + (8 * $0.25)
= $3 + $2
= $5

Now, we can find the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount paid:

Change = Amount paid - Total cost
= $10 - $5
= $5

Therefore, the change received is $5."
"To determine the number of people who accept the position, we can apply the given percentages step by step.

First, we calculate the number of people who receive interviews, which is 30% of the total applicants.

Let's denote the total number of applicants as $n = 100$. Then, the number of people who receive interviews is $0.3n = 0.3 \times 100 = 30$.

Next, we find the number of people who receive a job offer, which is 20% of those who receive interviews.

The number of people who receive a job offer is $0.2 \times 30 = 6$.

Finally, we determine the number of people who accept the position, which is a third of those who receive a job offer.

The number of people who accept the position is $\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total amount of rice given to Goldy's cousin and brother, we need to calculate the total number of sacks given away and then multiply it by the weight of each sack.

Let's start by finding the total number of sacks given away. Goldy gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. 

Total sacks given away = 3 + 4 = 7 sacks

Since there are 25 kilograms of rice per sack, we can calculate the total kilograms given away by multiplying the total sacks by the weight of each sack.

Total kilograms given away = 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms

Therefore, the total amount of rice given to Goldy's cousin and brother is 175 kilograms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of cereal boxes purchased between this week and last week, we need to calculate the total number of boxes bought this week and then subtract the number of boxes bought last week.

Let's denote the number of boxes of Coco Crunch as C and the number of boxes of Fruit Loops as F. We know that Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, so C = 3 and F = 5.

The total number of boxes bought this week is the sum of the boxes of Coco Crunch and Fruit Loops: C + F = 3 + 5 = 8.

Last week, Castle bought 4 boxes of cereal.

To find the difference in the number of boxes bought this week and last week, we subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the total number of boxes bought this week: 8 - 4 = 4.

Therefore, the difference in the number of cereal boxes purchased between this week and last week is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the total number of taps for each scenario and then add them together.

Let's denote the number of taps per minute for each foot as follows:
- Right foot taps per minute (R) = 300
- Left foot taps per minute (L) = 250

Scenario 1: Arms down
The total number of taps per minute is the sum of the taps per minute for each foot: R + L = 300 + 250 = 550.
The total number of taps for 3 minutes is the product of the total taps per minute and the number of minutes: 550 * 3 = 1650.

Scenario 2: Arms up
The total number of taps per minute is the sum of the taps per minute for each foot: R = L = 200.
The total number of taps for 2 minutes is the product of the total taps per minute and the number of minutes: 200 * 2 = 400.

Now, we can find the total number of taps by adding the total number of taps for each scenario: 1650 + 400 = 2050.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2050}$"
"To determine the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and subtract it from the total damage it will cause to his car.

The total damage to his car is $450.

The cost of fixing the pothole includes the fine for unauthorized road maintenance, which is $120, and the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt, which is 3 × 25 = $75.

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $120 + $75 = $195.

Now, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the total damage it will cause to his car: $450 - $195 = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

The final answer is: $255"
"To determine the total number of chairs left in the restaurant, we need to calculate the difference between the initial number of chairs and the number of chairs sent for repair.

Let's denote the initial number of normal chairs as N = 170 and the initial number of baby chairs as B = 23. The total number of chairs sent for repair is the sum of the normal chairs and baby chairs sent, which is 20 + 13 = 33.

The total number of chairs left can be calculated as follows:

Total chairs left = (N - 20) + (B - 13)
Total chairs left = (170 - 20) + (23 - 13)
Total chairs left = 150 + 10
Total chairs left = 160

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left.

The final answer is: 160"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into manageable parts. Let's start by determining the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two of his friends. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can express this as a fraction of the total number of slices.

Let's denote the total number of slices as S. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 times 12, as there are 5 people in total (Bryce and 4 friends). Therefore, S = 5 * 12 = 60.

Now, we can calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and two of his friends as 2/3 of the total number of slices:

(2/3) * S = (2/3) * 60 = 40 slices

However, this is the total number of slices eaten by 5 people, but we know that 2 of these people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:

(2/3) * 3 * 12 = 24 slices

Now, we subtract the number of slices eaten by 3 people from the total number of slices eaten by 5 people to find the number of slices eaten by the remaining 2 people:

40 slices - 24 slices = 16 slices

Now, we know that 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is:

2 * 9 = 18 slices

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:

Total number of slices = 5 * 12 = 60 slices
Total number of slices eaten = 24 slices + 16 slices + 18 slices = 58 slices
Number of slices left = 60 slices - 58 slices = 2 slices

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we first need to calculate the time taken by the dog. Since the dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we can express this as a ratio of their times.

Let's denote the time taken by the cat as $t_c$ and the time taken by the dog as $t_d$. We are given that $t_c = 30$ minutes. The ratio of the time taken by the dog to the time taken by the cat is 2/3, so we can write:

$$\frac{t_d}{t_c} = \frac{2}{3}$$

Substituting the value of $t_c$, we get:

$$\frac{t_d}{30} = \frac{2}{3}$$

Solving for $t_d$, we multiply both sides by 30:

$$t_d = \frac{2}{3} \cdot 30 = 20$$

Now that we have the times taken by both the cat and the dog, we can calculate the average time:

$$\text{Average time} = \frac{t_c + t_d}{2} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25$$

Therefore, the average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches, so 8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches. 
Adding 4 inches to that gives us 96 + 4 = 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. 

We can write the equation as: x * 9 + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us: x * 9 = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us: x = 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars. We know that there are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows, and a quarter of the windows are smashed.

Total windows smashed from students' cars = (1/4) × (64 × 4)
= (1/4) × 256
= 64

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows, and three-fourths of the windows are smashed.

Total windows smashed from teachers' cars = (3/4) × (32 × 2)
= (3/4) × 64
= 48

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars.

Total windows smashed = 64 + 48
= 112

The final answer is: $\boxed{112}$"
"To determine the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we need to calculate the proportion of blue spools to the total number of spools.

First, let's identify the total number of blue spools. We have 15 light blue spools and 45 dark blue spools, so the total number of blue spools is 15 + 45 = 60.

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. This includes the 15 light blue, 45 dark blue, 40 light green, and 50 dark green spools. Therefore, the total number of spools is 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue is 40%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

First, let's find the number of people who voted by midday. 2/5 of 5000 people had voted by midday. This can be expressed as:

$$\frac{2}{5} \cdot 5000 = 2000$$

So, 2000 people voted by midday.

Next, we need to find the number of people who voted by 16:00. 2/3 of the remaining people had voted by 16:00. The number of people remaining after midday is:

$$5000 - 2000 = 3000$$

Now, we can calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00:

$$\frac{2}{3} \cdot 3000 = 2000$$

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00:

$$5000 - (2000 + 2000) = 5000 - 4000 = 1000$$

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we must first calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will consume during this period. Given that Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day, the total number of pieces he will chew in 30 days can be calculated as follows:

Total pieces of gum = 4 pieces/day * 30 days = 4 * 30 = 120 pieces

Next, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack, which is 15. This will give us the number of packs Parker will need:

Number of packs = Total pieces of gum / Number of pieces per pack
= 120 / 15
= 8

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers required, we need to calculate the total number of smores needed. 

First, let's find the total number of smores required for the kids. Since 9 kids want 2 smores each, we can express this as 9 * 2 = 18 smores.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of smores required for the adults. Since 6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, this can be expressed as 6 * 1 = 6 smores.

Now, we can find the total number of smores required by adding the number of smores for kids and adults: 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, we can find the total number of sleeves needed by dividing the total number of smores by 8: 24 / 8 = 3.

Given that there are 3 sleeves in a box, we can determine the total number of boxes needed by dividing the total number of sleeves by 3: 3 / 3 = 1.

Therefore, the number of boxes of graham crackers required is 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"Given the problem, we can approach it by first defining the variables and then solving the system of equations.

Let's denote Dora's age as D, her father's age as F, and her mother's age as M.

We are given the following information:
1. Dora's age is 15 years, so D = 15.
2. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, so F = 2D + 8.
3. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so M = F - 4.

Now, we can substitute the value of D into the equation for F:
F = 2D + 8
F = 2(15) + 8
F = 30 + 8
F = 38

Next, we can substitute the value of F into the equation for M:
M = F - 4
M = 38 - 4
M = 34

Now that we have the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can find the total combined age:
Total combined age = D + F + M
= 15 + 38 + 34
= 87

The final answer is: 87"
"To determine the amount each of Greg's siblings received, we can apply the concept of division. When dividing a quantity into equal parts, we use the formula:

Amount per sibling = Total amount ÷ Number of siblings

Given that the total amount is $20 and the number of siblings is 3, we can calculate the amount per sibling as follows:

Amount per sibling = $20 ÷ 3

Using long division or a calculator, we find that:

Amount per sibling = $20 ÷ 3 = $6.67

Therefore, each of Greg's siblings received $6.67."
"To determine the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we need to calculate the combined weight of all her books. 

First, let's consider the weights of her language books: French (4 pounds) and English (3 pounds). The total weight of these two books is 4 + 3 = 7 pounds.

Next, we need to calculate the weight of her math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds, the total weight of these two books is 2 x 2 = 4 pounds.

Lastly, we need to consider the weight of her history book, which is twice as much as her English book. Since the English book weighs 3 pounds, the history book weighs 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the books: 7 (language books) + 4 (math and science books) + 6 (history book) = 17 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A obtained 20% of the total votes, which can be expressed as 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A, which can be calculated as 20 + (0.5 * 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100. The combined votes for candidates A and B are 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

To find the number of votes candidate C received, we subtract the combined votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes: 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Initially, Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. This means Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

When Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck's new total is 77 + 10 = 87 apples. 

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris. To do this, we'll subtract Beck's new total from Boris's new total. Boris now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.

So, the difference between Boris and Beck's new totals is 90 - 87 = 3 apples.

Therefore, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now."
"To determine the amount of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial amount of water.

Let's start by calculating the total amount of water used for each type of cube:

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 3 × 4 = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 7 × 2 = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 8 × 0.5 = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

To find the amount of water left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a relationship between the number of books each person has. Let's denote the number of books Steven has as S. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, Clara's book count is 2S. We are given that Clara has 20 books, so we can set up the equation:

2S = 20

To find the value of S, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

S = 20 / 2
S = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find the number of books Alice has. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we add 6 to Steven's book count:

Alice's books = S + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's book count from Clara's book count:

Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and a half-gallon jar costs $2 less, we can express the cost of a half-gallon jar as $5 - $2 = $3.

To find the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars, we can calculate the cost of each type of jar and then sum them up.

Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 × $5 = $50
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 × $3 = $48

Now, we can find the total amount of money Cecelia spent by adding the cost of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars.

Total amount of money Cecelia spent = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total amount of money Cecelia spent = $50 + $48 = $98

"Given a class of 50 students with diverse hobbies, we can apply set theory to determine the number of students who like to play video games. Let's denote the sets as follows:

- B = {students who like to bake}
- G = {students who like to play video games}
- M = {students who like to play music}
- S = {students who like to play basketball}

We are given that |B| = 10, |S| = 5, and |M| = 2|S| = 10.

Since the total number of students is 50, we can express the union of the sets B, G, M, and S as:

|B ∪ G ∪ M ∪ S| = 50

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we can expand this expression as:

|B ∪ G ∪ M ∪ S| = |B| + |G| + |M| + |S| - |B ∩ G| - |B ∩ M| - |B ∩ S| - |G ∩ M| - |G ∩ S| - |M ∩ S| + |B ∩ G ∩ M| + |B ∩ G ∩ S| + |G ∩ M ∩ S| + |B ∩ M ∩ S| - |B ∩ G ∩ M ∩ S|

However, since we are not given any information about the intersections of these sets, we will assume that they are pairwise disjoint, i.e., |B ∩ G| = |B ∩ M| = |B ∩ S| = |G ∩ M| = |G ∩ S| = |M ∩ S| = 0.

We can simplify the expression to:

|B ∪ G ∪ M ∪ S| = |B| + |G| + |M| + |S|

Substituting the given values, we get:

50 = 10 + |G| + 10 + 5

Solving for |G|, we get:

|G| = 50 - 10 - 10 - 5
|G| = 25

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the number of birds that were scared away, we can calculate 1/3 of the initial number of birds, which is 12.

$$\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = \frac{12}{3} = 4$$

So, 4 birds were scared away. 

Now, we subtract 4 from the initial number of birds: 
$$12 - 4 = 8$$

Then, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. 
$$8 + 20 = 28$$

The final number of birds in the backyard is 28."
"Given that there are two classes with a total of 80 students, and each class has an equal number of students, we can determine the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2. This yields:

$$\frac{80}{2} = 40$$

Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, we can calculate the number of girls in each class by multiplying the number of students in each class by 0.4:

$$40 \times 0.4 = 16$$

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

$$40 - 16 = 24$$

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of cake slices remaining on the plate, we can break down the sequence of events into a series of mathematical operations.

Initially, Mara had 2 slices on the plate. She then added 3 slices, resulting in a total of 2 + 3 = 5 slices.

Next, she tripled the number of slices, which can be represented as 5 × 3 = 15 slices.

Subsequently, she consumed 2 slices, leaving her with 15 - 2 = 13 slices.

Finally, her friend stole 5 slices, reducing the total to 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

Therefore, the number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to calculate the total number of animals and divide by the number of days in a week.

Let's start by adding up the total number of animals:

Total number of dogs = 8
Total number of cats = 5
Total number of birds = 3
Total number of horses = 12

Total number of animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Now, we'll divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

Total number of animals / Number of days in a week = 28 / 7

To perform this division, we can use long division or a calculator. In this case, we'll use a calculator for simplicity.

28 ÷ 7 = 4

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the profit made by Mark, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue from the packs of old magic cards.

The total cost is the cost of the packs: 3 packs * $1800 = $5400.

The total revenue is the sum of the value of the cards: 
- 1 card worth $4000
- 1 card worth $1000
- 30 cards worth an average of $50 each: 30 * $50 = $1500
Total revenue = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"To determine the cost savings of choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference.

Let's denote the number of adults as A and the number of children as C. In this case, A = 2 and C = 2.

The cost for the first amusement park can be expressed as:
C1 = 26A + 12C
C1 = 26(2) + 12(2)
C1 = 52 + 24
C1 = 76

The cost for the second amusement park can be expressed as:
C2 = 14A + 10C
C2 = 14(2) + 10(2)
C2 = 28 + 20
C2 = 48

Now, let's find the difference in cost between the two amusement parks:
ΔC = C1 - C2
ΔC = 76 - 48
ΔC = 28

The cost savings of choosing the second amusement park over the first is $28.

"To determine the weekly savings of the tomato vendor, we need to calculate the daily savings and then multiply it by 7.

The daily savings can be found by subtracting the new cost per tomato from the old cost per tomato, multiplied by the number of tomatoes sold per day.

Daily savings = (500 * 0.5) - (500 * 0.4)
Daily savings = 250 - 200
Daily savings = 50

Now, we multiply the daily savings by 7 to find the weekly savings.

Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7
Weekly savings = 50 * 7
Weekly savings = 350

The final answer is: $350"
"Given the problem, we can establish a relationship between the number of marbles each person has. Let's denote the number of marbles Sean has as S, the number of marbles Carl has as C, and the number of marbles Cal has as Ca.

We are given that Sean has 56 marbles, so S = 56.

We also know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, which can be expressed as S = Ca/2. Substituting the value of S, we get 56 = Ca/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we find Ca = 112.

Furthermore, we are told that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, which can be written as C = 4S. Substituting the value of S, we get C = 4 * 56 = 224.

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together: C + Ca = 224 + 112 = 336.

The final answer is: $\boxed{336}$"
"To determine the number of additional groups required, we first need to find the total number of students per group. Since the students are to be separated into six groups of equal size, we can divide the total number of students by the number of groups.

Let's denote the number of students per group as 'x'. We know that the total number of students is 54, and they are to be divided into 6 groups. Therefore, we can write the equation:

6x = 54

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:

x = 54 / 6
x = 9

Now that we know the number of students per group, we can find the total number of students required for 12 groups by multiplying the number of groups by the number of students per group:

Total students required = 12x
Total students required = 12 * 9
Total students required = 108

Since we already have 54 students, we need to find the number of additional students required to form 12 groups:

Additional students required = Total students required - Total students available
Additional students required = 108 - 54
Additional students required = 54

To find the number of additional groups required, we can divide the additional students required by the number of students per group:

Additional groups required = Additional students required / Students per group
Additional groups required = 54 / 9
Additional groups required = 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented in a week and then multiply it by 8 (2 months * 4 weeks/month).

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in a week. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.

- Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekend days: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Now, we can calculate the total chairs rented in two 4-week months by multiplying the total chairs rented in a week by 8:
\[ 500 \text{ chairs/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 4000 \text{ chairs} \]

"To determine the number of bananas Gunther had at the end, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

When Arnold stole half of the bananas, the number of bananas left is 48 - (48/2) = 48 - 24 = 24.

Gunther then added 25 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 24 + 25 = 49.

Next, Arnold stole 12 bananas, so the number of bananas left is 49 - 12 = 37.

Finally, Gunther added 6 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 37 + 6 = 43.

The final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43."

Given that the monthly electricity bill is $100 and there are 4 roommates, we can calculate the monthly cost per roommate as follows:

$100 ÷ 4 = $25

To find the annual cost per roommate, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

$25 × 12 = $300

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to calculate the initial number of items sent and then subtract the number of broken items.

The initial number of glasses sent is 8 dozen, which is equivalent to 8 * 12 = 96 glasses. Similarly, the initial number of plates sent is 4 dozen, which is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

Now, let's calculate the number of glasses and plates left after some were broken:
- Broken glasses: 10
- Broken plates: 6

To find the number of glasses left, we subtract the number of broken glasses from the initial number of glasses: 96 - 10 = 86.
To find the number of plates left, we subtract the number of broken plates from the initial number of plates: 48 - 6 = 42.

Therefore, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.

The final answer is: 
Glasses: 86

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's determine the number of small buttons Lorraine gets from trading her small stickers. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them for large buttons. This can be calculated as follows:

90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers

Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

Next, we need to find out how many small buttons she gets from trading her large stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and the rest for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers. 

Now, let's calculate the number of small buttons she gets from trading the remaining large stickers. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has. She has 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading large stickers. 

Total buttons = 27 + 20 + 60 = 107

However, we need to consider that she also gets 20 large buttons from trading 50% of her large stickers. So, the total number of buttons is:

Total buttons = 27 + 20 + 60 + 20 = 107

The final answer is: $\boxed{107}$"

"To determine the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since there are twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since x is the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x:

2x = 2(11)
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total number of shirts ordered, we need to calculate the number of students for each size and add them together.

Let's denote the number of students who need extra-small shirts as E, small as S, medium as M, large as L, and extra-large as XL.

Given that 11 students need extra-small shirts, we have E = 11.

Since twice as many students need size small as extra small, we have S = 2E = 2(11) = 22.

The number of students who need size medium is four less than the number of size small students, so M = S - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18.

Half as many students need size large as size medium, so L = M/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Six more students need size extra-large than large, so XL = L + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15.

Now, let's add the number of students for each size together:
Total shirts ordered = E + S + M + L + XL = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To calculate the final price after a 5% discount on an item marked at $140, we can use the following formula:

Final price = Original price - (Original price * Discount percentage)

Given the original price is $140 and the discount percentage is 5% or 0.05, we can substitute these values into the formula:

Final price = $140 - ($140 * 0.05)
Final price = $140 - $7
Final price = $133

Therefore, the final price after the discount is $133.

The final answer is: $133"
"To determine the total duration of the 20 playlists, we can apply the concept of multiplication to find the total number of hours.

S = 300 songs/playlist
P = 20 playlists
D = 10 hours/song

To find the total number of hours, we multiply the number of songs in each playlist by the number of playlists and then multiply the result by the duration of each song in hours:

Total hours = S × P × D
= 300 × 20 × 10
= 60000 hours

Therefore, the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is 60000."
"To determine the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we need to calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win and then the number of people who think horse #7 will win.

First, we find the number of people who think horse #2 will win. This is 20% of the total number of people, which is 50.

20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #7 will win. This is 60% of the remaining people, which is 50 - 10 = 40 people.

60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The number of people who think horse #12 will win is the remaining people, which is 40 - 24 = 16 people.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Given that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians and one third of the Pomeranians are girls, with 6 Pomeranian girls, we can deduce the total number of Pomeranians and subsequently the total number of puppies.

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can express this as:

1/3 * P = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

P = 6 * 3
P = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as N. We can express this as:

2/3 * N = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

N = 18 * (3/2)
N = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the amount Jayden needs to buy the camera, we must first calculate the total amount of money he has after receiving the allowance from his sister. 

Let's denote Jayden's initial amount as J = $70 and Ava's allowance as A = $90. Since Ava gave Jayden half of her allowance, we can express this as:

J + (A/2) = J + (90/2)
J + 45 = 70 + 45
J + 45 = 115

Now, we know Jayden has a total of $115. The cost of the camera is C = $200. To find the amount Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the cost of the camera:

C - (J + 45) = 200 - 115
C - (J + 45) = 85

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 to buy the camera.

The final answer is: $85"
"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x.

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can write the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"

"Given that George has 45% more pears than bananas and he has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Let's denote the number of bananas as B and the number of pears as P. We are given that P = B + 0.45B, since George has 45% more pears than bananas.

We are also given that B = 200. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

P = 200 + 0.45(200)
P = 200 + 90
P = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

Total number of fruits = B + P
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

"To determine the number of candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to perform a simple subtraction and division operation.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Marissa had as M, the cost of the ball as B, and the cost of each candy bar as C. We are given that M = $80, B = $20, and C = $5.

First, we subtract the cost of the ball from the initial amount of money to find the remaining amount:

M - B = 80 - 20 = 60

This remaining amount is then divided by the cost of each candy bar to find the number of candy bars Marissa bought:

(80 - 20) / 5 = 60 / 5 = 12

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the cost of making 4 liters of juice, we need to calculate the total amount of oranges required and their corresponding cost.

First, we establish the ratio of oranges to liters of juice, which is 5 kilograms of oranges per 1 liter of juice. To make 4 liters of juice, we multiply this ratio by 4, resulting in 5 * 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the oranges. Given that each kilogram of oranges costs $3, we multiply the total kilograms of oranges by the cost per kilogram: 20 * 3 = $60.

Therefore, the total cost for Sam to make 4 liters of juice is $60.

"Given that Ezra read 300 books in one hour and decided to read 150 more, we can calculate the total number of books he will have read. 

Let's denote the number of books Ahmed read as 'A'. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can express this relationship as:

A + 150 = 300

To find the value of 'A', we subtract 150 from both sides of the equation:

A = 300 - 150
A = 150

Now that we know Ahmed read 150 books, we can calculate the total number of books both Ezra and Ahmed read. 

Ezra's total books = 300 + 150 = 450
Ahmed's total books = 150
Total books read by both = 450 + 150 = 600

"To determine the selling price of each ear of corn, we first calculate the revenue generated from the sale of the eggplants. Given that Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, the total revenue from eggplants is:

20 \* 3 = $60

Since Bennet aims to make a total of $135, the revenue from the sale of corn must be $135 - $60 = $75.

Now, we can calculate the selling price of each ear of corn by dividing the total revenue from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25):

$$\frac{75}{25} = 3$$

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To determine the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we need to calculate the time she dedicates to this activity. 

First, let's calculate the total time available for her weekend activities: 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, totaling 12 hours.

Next, we'll subtract the time spent reading, which is 3 hours, from the total time available to find the remaining time: 12 - 3 = 9 hours.

Since Tatiana spends 1/3 of the remaining time playing video games, we can calculate this as 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

Now, we can find the time spent playing soccer by subtracting the time spent reading and playing video games from the total time available: 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer, we'll divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100: (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer is 50%.

"To determine the number of pencils Anthony kept, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, Anthony gives 1/2 of his 50 pencils to Brandon. This can be calculated as:

50 - (1/2 * 50) = 50 - 25 = 25

So, Anthony has 25 pencils left.

Next, he gives 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find 3/5 of 25, we can multiply 25 by 3/5:

25 * (3/5) = (25 * 3) / 5 = 75 / 5 = 15

Now, we subtract the number of pencils given to Charlie from the remaining pencils:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

The time it takes to drive to the museum can be calculated using the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Given that the distance to the museum is 150 miles and the speed is 75 mph, we can substitute these values into the formula:

Time = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since the distance to the museum is the same as the distance back home, the time it takes to drive back home is also 2 hours.

The total time driving is the sum of the time to drive to the museum and the time to drive back home:

Total time driving = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

Now, we add the time Jack spends at the museum to the total time driving to find the total time he is gone from home:

Total time = Total time driving + Time at the museum = 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours

Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is 10 hours.

"To determine the number of wheels left in the box, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the toys and subtract that from the initial number of wheels in the box.

First, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles. We know that each car requires 4 wheels and each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.

Number of wheels for the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 4 * 57 = 228 wheels
Number of wheels for the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 2 * 73 = 146 wheels

Now, we can find the total number of wheels needed by adding the number of wheels for the cars and the number of wheels for the motorcycles.

Total number of wheels needed = 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

To find the number of wheels left in the box, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the initial number of wheels in the box.

Number of wheels left = 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 650 - 374 = 276 wheels

"To calculate the final price after a 20% discount on a laptop priced at $1000, we can use the following formula:

Final price = Original price - (Original price * Discount percentage)

Given the original price is $1000 and the discount percentage is 20% or 0.20, we can substitute these values into the formula:

Final price = $1000 - ($1000 * 0.20)
Final price = $1000 - $200
Final price = $800

Therefore, the final price after the discount is $800.

"To determine the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's calculate the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can express this as a fraction:

$$\frac{1}{3} \cdot 600 = 200$$

The cost of these movies in series is $6 each, so the total cost is:

$$200 \cdot 6 = 1200$$

Next, we need to find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:

$$600 - 200 = 400$$

Now, let's calculate the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, which can be expressed as:

$$0.4 \cdot 400 = 160$$

The cost of these older movies is $5 each, so the total cost is:

$$160 \cdot 5 = 800$$

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:

$$400 - 160 = 240$$

The cost of the normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost is:

$$240 \cdot 10 = 2400$$

Now, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost:

$$1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400$$

The final answer is: $4400"
"To determine the total amount spent by Winston on the fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them together.

Let's denote the cost of peaches as P, plums as Q, and apricots as A. Given that the cost of peaches is $2.00 per pound, plums is $1.00 per pound, and apricots is $3.00 per pound, we can express the total cost as:

Total Cost = P + Q + A

We are given that Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches, 8 pounds of plums, and 6 pounds of apricots. Therefore, we can express the cost of each type of fruit as:

P = 6 * $2.00 = $12.00
Q = 8 * $1.00 = $8.00
A = 6 * $3.00 = $18.00

Substituting these values into the total cost equation, we get:

Total Cost = $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00

Using the commutative and associative properties of addition, we can simplify the expression:

Total Cost = ($12.00 + $8.00) + $18.00
Total Cost = $20.00 + $18.00
Total Cost = $38.00

Therefore, the total amount spent by Winston on the fruit is $38.00.

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To determine the distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, then sum these values.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. Given that their driving speed was 50 miles per hour, half of this value is $50/2 = 25$ miles per hour. Since they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, their hiking speed is $25 - 5 = 20$ miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance they drove. The time spent driving was 6 hours, and their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance they drove is $50 \cdot 6 = 300$ miles.

Next, we'll find the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour. The distance they hiked is $20 \cdot 1.5 = 30$ miles.

To find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked: $300 + 30 = 330$ miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{330}$"
"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we need to establish their individual scores based on the given conditions.

Let's denote Emma's score as x. 

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, her enemy score is x + 8. 
Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, her berry score is x + 3.
Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, her timer score is 30(60 - (x + 4)) = 30(56 - x) = 1680 - 30x.

Emma's total score is x.

Ava's total score is (x + 8) + (x + 3) + (1680 - 30x) = 2x + 1691 - 30x = -28x + 1691.

The difference in their scores is (-28x + 1691) - x = -29x + 1691.

However, we don't have any information about the value of x. We can assume that the difference in their scores is the difference in their enemy and berry scores, and the difference in their timer scores.

The difference in their enemy scores is 8.
The difference in their berry scores is 3.
The difference in their timer scores is 30(60 - (x + 4)) - 30(60 - x) = 30(-4) = -120.

The difference in their scores is 8 + 3 - 120 = -109.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-109}$"
"Given that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars, and two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each, we can determine the cost of the other two pizzas.

First, we calculate the total cost of the two known pizzas: 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Next, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas: 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza: 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas costs 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

Let's denote the number of times they ride on usual days as $t$. Since they ride 3 times a day for 5 days, the total number of times they ride on usual days is $3 \times 5 = 15$.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is $2t$ times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is $2t \times 2 = 4t$.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is the sum of the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days, which is $15 + 4t$.

However, we need to find the value of $t$ to determine the total number of times they ride in a week. Since they ride 3 times a day for 5 days, we can set up the equation $3 \times 5 = 15$ to represent the number of times they ride on usual days. This equation is already solved, and we know that $t = 3$.

Now that we have the value of $t$, we can substitute it into the equation $15 + 4t$ to find the total number of times they ride in a week: $15 + 4(3) = 15 + 12 = 27$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond. He then purchased a mixed batch of fish from the pet store, consisting of both white and orange fish. The total number of fish he bought is given as 17.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O. We can set up the equation W + O = 17, representing the total number of fish purchased.

After adding the new fish to his pond, Bob found that he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be represented by the equation 3 + O = 2(4 + W).

We can solve the first equation for O: O = 17 - W.

Now, substitute this expression for O into the second equation: 3 + (17 - W) = 2(4 + W).

Simplify the equation: 20 - W = 8 + 2W.

Add W to both sides: 20 = 8 + 3W.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 12 = 3W.

Divide both sides by 3: W = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in a week and then apply the fuel efficiency and gas price.

The distance between Andy's home and office is 5 miles, and he travels this distance twice a day (to and from work), so the total daily distance is 2 * 5 = 10 miles.

Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week using the formula:

Fuel consumption (gallons) = Total distance (miles) / Fuel efficiency (MPG)

Fuel consumption (gallons) = 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week

Next, we can calculate the total cost per week by multiplying the fuel consumption by the price of gas:

Total cost (dollars) = Fuel consumption (gallons) * Price per gallon (dollars)
Total cost (dollars) = 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week

Therefore, the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car is $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the quarters. Since Carrie was given 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, the total value of the quarters is:

$$140 \times 0.25 = 35$$

Next, we need to find the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. To find the value of the twenties she spent, we multiply the total value of the twenties by 3/5:

$$\frac{3}{5} \times 10 \times 20 = \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120$$

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent to find the total amount of money she spent:

$$35 + 120 = 155$$

The final answer is: $155"
"To determine the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

Let's denote the number of tomato plants as T and the number of eggplant plants as E. We are given that T = 5 and E = 8.

The yield of tomatoes per plant is 22, so the total number of tomatoes is given by the product of the number of tomato plants and the yield per plant: 22T = 22 * 5 = 110.

Similarly, the yield of eggplants per plant is 4, so the total number of eggplants is given by the product of the number of eggplant plants and the yield per plant: 4E = 4 * 8 = 32.

The total number of fruits is the sum of the total number of tomatoes and eggplants: 110 + 32 = 142.

The final answer is: $\boxed{142}$"
"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to calculate the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, then subtract that from the total number of TVs sold.

The fraction of smart TVs sold is 1/4, and the fraction of analog TVs sold is 1/8. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 8. We can rewrite 1/4 as 2/8.

Now, we can add the fractions: 2/8 + 1/8 = 3/8.

This means that 3/8 of the total TVs sold are either smart TVs or analog TVs. To find the number of TVs that are either smart or analog, we multiply 3/8 by the total number of TVs sold, which is 40.

(3/8) * 40 = (3 * 40) / 8 = 120 / 8 = 15

So, 15 TVs are either smart or analog. To find the number of OLED TVs, we subtract this from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the amount of money John is missing, we need to calculate the total cost of the trip and subtract the amount the school will cover, as well as the amount John has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school will cover half of this amount, we can express this as:

School's contribution = (1/2) × Total cost
= (1/2) × $300
= $150

Now, we need to find the amount John is missing. This can be calculated by subtracting the school's contribution and John's contribution from the total cost:

Amount John is missing = Total cost - (School's contribution + John's contribution)
= $300 - ($150 + $50)
= $300 - $200
= $100

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we must first calculate the temperature difference between the freezing point and the night temperature.

Given that the temperature during the day is 45 degrees and it's 33 degrees colder during the night, we can find the night temperature by subtracting 33 from 45:

45 - 33 = 12 degrees

Now, we need to find the temperature difference between the freezing point (32 degrees) and the night temperature (12 degrees):

32 - 12 = 20 degrees

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can find the number of logs needed by dividing the temperature difference by the heat each log provides:

20 / 5 = 4

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic arithmetic operations and fractions. 

First, we determine the number of groups by dividing the total number of people by the number of people per group.

Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells by multiplying the total number of groups by the fraction of groups that brought back seashells.

Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we find the total number of seashells by multiplying the number of groups that brought back seashells by the number of seashells per group.

Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of people on the train, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

Let's denote the initial number of people on the train as $n$. We are given that $n = 172$. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so the number of people remaining is $n - 47$. Then, 13 people get on, so the new total is $n - 47 + 13$. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so the final number of people on the train is $(n - 47 + 13) - 38$.

Substituting the initial value of $n$, we get:
$(172 - 47 + 13) - 38$

First, we perform the subtraction and addition inside the parentheses:
$172 - 47 = 125$
$125 + 13 = 138$

Then, we subtract 38 from 138:
$138 - 38 = 100$

Therefore, the number of people on the train is 100.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we can apply the concept of arithmetic multiplication. Specifically, we will use the formula:

Total Amount = (Number of Bottle Caps per Day) × (Value of Each Bottle Cap) × (Number of Days in the Month)

Given values are:
- Number of Bottle Caps per Day: 10
- Value of Each Bottle Cap: $0.25
- Number of Days in the Month: 30

First, we multiply the number of bottle caps per day by the value of each bottle cap:
10 × $0.25 = $2.50 per day

Next, we multiply the daily amount by the number of days in the month:
$2.50 × 30 = $75

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours.

Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For 8 hours, her earnings can be calculated as follows:

8 hours * $20/hour = 8 \* 20 = $160

For the additional 3 hours, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. This can be expressed as 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour. For 3 hours, her earnings are:

3 hours * $30/hour = 3 \* 30 = $90

Now, we can find her total earnings for the day by adding her earnings from the regular hours and the additional hours:

$160 + $90 = $250

Therefore, Jamie's total earnings for the day are $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the sum of the female lions, male lions, and lion cubs.

Let's denote the number of female lions as F, the number of male lions as M, and the number of lion cubs as C. We are given that F = 12, M = F/2, and C = 14.

We can express the number of male lions in terms of F as M = 12/2 = 6.

Now, we can find the total number of lions by adding F, M, and C: Total = F + M + C = 12 + 6 + 14.

Performing the arithmetic operation, we get: Total = 12 + 6 + 14 = 32.

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To determine the amount of money Mike will have left over after purchasing the discounted jeans, we need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are advertised at a 25% discount. To find the discount amount, we can multiply the original price by the discount percentage (expressed as a decimal).

Discount = 0.25 * $40
Discount = $10

Now, let's find the price after the discount:
Price after discount = Original price - Discount
Price after discount = $40 - $10
Price after discount = $30

To find the amount of money Mike will have left over after paying with a $50 bill, we subtract the price after the discount from the $50 bill:

Money left over = $50 - $30
Money left over = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to consider the initial workforce and the monthly additions.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees can be calculated using the arithmetic series formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:

S = n/2 * (a1 + an)

where S is the sum of the sequence, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, the number of terms (n) is 4 (initial employees + 3 months of hiring), the first term (a1) is 200, and the last term (an) is 200 + 3*20 = 260.

S = 4/2 * (200 + 260)
S = 2 * 460
S = 920

However, this formula calculates the total number of employees, not the total number of employees hired. To find the total number of employees hired, we subtract the initial number of employees from the total:
Total employees hired = 920 - 200 = 720

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee:
Total salary per month = 200 * $4000 = $800,000

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
Total amount paid = $800,000 * 3 = $2,400,000

The final answer is: $2,400,000"
"To determine the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the sum of the time it takes to sing each song. 

Let's denote the time for ""Deck the Halls"" as D and the time for ""Jingle Bells"" as J. We are given that D = 150 seconds and J = 240 seconds.

Since the choir plans to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice, we need to multiply the time for ""Deck the Halls"" by 2. This can be expressed as 2D.

The total time for caroling is the sum of the time for ""Deck the Halls"" (2D) and the time for ""Jingle Bells"" (J). This can be expressed as 2D + J.

Substituting the given values, we get:
2D + J = 2(150) + 240
2D + J = 300 + 240
2D + J = 540

Therefore, the total time the choir will be caroling is 540 seconds.

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Let's start by calculating Billy's earnings. Initially, his hourly wage is $10. After 2 months, he receives a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. Following another year, he receives a raise of $1.00 per hour, resulting in a final hourly wage of $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, let's calculate Billy's total earnings after working 20 hours:

$$\text{Billy's total earnings} = 20 \times 11.50 = 230$$

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Next, we calculate Sally's total earnings after working 20 hours:

$$\text{Sally's total earnings} = 20 \times 10.50 = 210$$

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find Nikita's score, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and add 11. 

Let's denote Pierson's score as P = 278. Half of P is P/2 = 278/2 = 139. 
Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita's score is N = 139 + 11 = 150.

To find the total score, we add Pierson's score and Nikita's score: P + N = 278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"To determine the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by both students and teachers.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. Therefore, the total number of students is:

40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is:

1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class. Therefore, the total number of teachers is:

40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is:

120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Now, we can find the total number of trees planted by adding the number of trees planted by students and teachers:

Total trees planted = 1000 trees (students) + 240 trees (teachers)
Total trees planted = 1240 trees

The final answer is: $\boxed{1240}$"
"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to determine the total number of stuffed animals she currently has and then calculate the number of goats required to make the percentage of goats 30% of the total.

First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

3 puppies + 5 koalas + 2 zebras + 4 frogs = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. To do this, we can multiply the total number of stuffed animals by 0.3:

14 * 0.3 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30%, so we will round to the nearest whole number that will make the percentage 30% or more.

Let's set up an equation to find the total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats:

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3:

14 + x = 100

However, this is not the correct equation. We need to set up the equation as follows:

"To determine the number of hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the target hours.

First, let's calculate the total hours Kris played in 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and she plays for half an hour every day. This can be represented as:

Total hours in 2 weeks = 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours

Next, let's calculate the total hours Kris played in 1 week. There are 7 days in 1 week, and she plays for 2 hours every day. This can be represented as:

Total hours in 1 week = 7 days * 2 hours/day = 7 * 2 = 14 hours

Now, we can find the total hours Kris has played by adding the hours from the 2 weeks and 1 week:

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

To find the number of hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours:

Hours still needed = 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"Given two cars traveling on a highway, one at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour and the other at a constant speed of 70 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance between them after 2 hours using the concept of relative motion.

The relative speed between the two cars is the difference in their speeds, which is 70 mph - 60 mph = 10 mph. This is the speed at which the distance between the two cars increases.

To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we multiply the relative speed by the time:
Distance = Relative Speed * Time
= 10 mph * 2 hours
= 20 miles

Therefore, the distance between the two cars after 2 hours is 20 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the ring, we need to consider the cost of the diamond, the cost of the gold, and the premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600, and the cost of the gold is $300. The total cost of the diamond and gold is therefore $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold. To calculate the premium, we multiply the total cost by 0.3: 0.3 * $900 = $270.

The total cost with the premium is then $900 + $270 = $1170.

Therefore, the total amount James paid for the ring is $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate of Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of fourth-graders, and the pass rate of fourth-graders is 40/100, the pass rate of fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80 out of 400.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed:
340 + 40 + 80 = 460

Next, let's find the total number of students:
500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: $\boxed{46}$"
"To determine the length of the mosaic, we first need to calculate the total number of square inches Milo can create with the available glass chips. Given that it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic and he has 2 bags of glass chips, each containing 72 chips, we can calculate the total number of chips as follows:

Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips per bag
Total chips = 144 chips

Now, we can find the total number of square inches Milo can create with the available chips:

Total square inches = Total chips / chips per square inch
Total square inches = 144 chips / 12 chips per square inch
Total square inches = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (length * width) to find the length:

Area = length * width
12 = length * 3

To find the length, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

length = 12 / 3
length = 4

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the initial amount of tea at the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and then add it to the remaining tea.

Let's start by calculating the total amount of tea consumed by the students who drank 1.5 quarts each. This can be expressed as:

Total tea consumed by 4 students = 4 × 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts

Next, we calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students who drank 2 quarts each:

Total tea consumed by 16 students = 16 × 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts

Now, we add the tea consumed by both groups to find the total amount of tea consumed:

Total tea consumed = 6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the remaining tea from quarts to gallons:

Remaining tea = 10 quarts = 10/4 gallons = 2.5 gallons

To find the initial amount of tea at the party, we add the total tea consumed to the remaining tea:

Initial amount of tea = Total tea consumed + Remaining tea = 38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

Converting the initial amount of tea from quarts to gallons:

Initial amount of tea = 48 quarts = 48/4 gallons = 12 gallons

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Initially, Dale ordered 100 candies. Then, he sold 150 candies. However, since he sold more candies than he initially had, we need to consider the additional order he placed. This indicates that he must have sold some of the initial order before placing the additional order.

Let's denote the number of candies sold from the initial order as x. Then, the number of candies left from the initial order is 100 - x. Since he sold 150 candies in total, the number of candies sold from the initial order is x = 150 - (number of candies sold from the additional order). However, we don't know the number of candies sold from the additional order.

Since Dale ordered 100 more candies, the total number of candies he has now is the sum of the candies left from the initial order and the additional order: (100 - x) + 100.

However, we can simplify this problem by considering the total number of candies Dale has now. He has 100 candies from the initial order and 100 candies from the additional order, for a total of 200 candies.

Since he sold 150 candies, the number of candies he still needs to sell is 200 - 150 = 50.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"Given the scenario where the number of students on campus doubles at the end of every month, starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, we can model this as a geometric progression with a common ratio of 2.

The formula for the nth term of a geometric progression is given by:

an = a1 * r^(n-1)

where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number.

In this case, a1 = 10 (initial number of students), r = 2 (doubling each month), and we want to find the number of students at the end of May, which is the 5th term (January is the 1st term).

a5 = 10 * 2^(5-1)
a5 = 10 * 2^4
a5 = 10 * 16
a5 = 160

To find the number of additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

Additional students = a5 - a1
= 160 - 10
= 150

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to calculate the total number of branches he climbed and then divide that by the number of days he worked.

Let's start by dividing the total amount of money Felix made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25) to find the total number of branches he climbed.

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $\frac{105}{0.25}$
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by the number of days.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = $\frac{420}{5}$
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

Let's denote the number of petals from each set of flowers as follows:
- Set 1: 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 × 5 = 15 petals
- Set 2: 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 × 6 = 24 petals
- Set 3: 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 × 4 = 20 petals
- Set 4: 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 × 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's calculate the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: $\boxed{97}$"
"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have, we need to calculate the remaining marshmallows after accounting for those used and dropped.

Let's denote the total number of marshmallows in the bag as M, the number of marshmallows used by John as J, the number of marshmallows used by DeSean as D, and the number of marshmallows dropped as d.

Given values:
- M = 35 (total marshmallows in the bag)
- J = 9 (marshmallows used by John)
- D = 9 (marshmallows used by DeSean)
- d = 3 (marshmallows dropped)

First, we calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped:
Total marshmallows used and dropped = J + D + d
= 9 + 9 + 3
= 21

Now, we find the remaining marshmallows:
Remaining marshmallows = M - (J + D + d)
= 35 - 21
= 14

Since there are two kids, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to determine the number of S'mores each kid can have:
S'mores each kid can have = Remaining marshmallows / 2
= 14 / 2
= 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total amount of money used at the arcade, we need to calculate the total time played by each person and then multiply it by the cost per minute.

Let's denote the time Jack plays as $t_J$, the time the two worse friends play as $t_{FW}$, and the time the better friend plays as $t_B$. We are given that $t_J = 240$ minutes, $t_{FW} = \frac{1}{2}t_J = 120$ minutes, and $t_B = \frac{3}{2}t_J = 360$ minutes.

The total time played is the sum of the individual times: $t_{total} = t_J + t_{FW} + t_{FW} + t_B = 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840$ minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is $\frac{1}{20} = 0.05$ dollars.

The total amount of money used is the product of the total time played and the cost per minute: $t_{total} \cdot \frac{1}{20} = 840 \cdot 0.05 = 42$ dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the ingredients and their quantities. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x, the amount of salt (and sugar) as 2x, and the amount of oil as 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces, which is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10

Combine like terms to simplify the equation:

8x = 10

To solve for x, divide both sides of the equation by 8:

x = 10/8

x = 1.25

Since the amount of oil is 4x, we can calculate the amount of oil as follows:

Oil = 4x
= 4(1.25)
= 5

Therefore, Tanya uses 5 ounces of oil in her salt scrub recipe.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total amount spent by John, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats can be calculated as follows:

3 goats * $500 = 3 × 500 = $1500

The cost of the cows can be calculated as follows:

2 cows * $1500 = 2 × 1500 = $3000

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows:

Total cost = $1500 + $3000 = $4500

Therefore, the total amount spent by John is $4500."
"To determine the number of cupcakes Paul should purchase, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of cupcakes required and the number of cupcakes he already has.

Let's denote the total number of cupcakes needed as T = 63 and the number of cupcakes Paul already has as C = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48.

The number of cupcakes Paul should buy, denoted as x, can be calculated as follows:

x = T - C
x = 63 - 48
x = 15

Therefore, Paul should purchase 15 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Given that Robert has 20 cars, and Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, we can calculate Joe's initial number of cars as follows:

Joe's initial number of cars = 2 * Robert's number of cars
= 2 * 20
= 40

Now, let's calculate the number of cars Joe sells. He sells 20% of his cars, which can be expressed as a decimal:

Number of cars sold = 0.2 * Joe's initial number of cars
= 0.2 * 40
= 8

Next, we need to find out how many cars Joe gives away. He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold:

Number of cars given away = 2 * Number of cars sold
= 2 * 8
= 16

To find the total number of cars Joe gives away, we add the number of cars sold and the number of cars given away:

Total number of cars given away = Number of cars sold + Number of cars given away
= 8 + 16
= 24

Finally, we can calculate the number of cars Joe remains with by subtracting the total number of cars given away from his initial number of cars:

Number of cars Joe remains with = Joe's initial number of cars - Total number of cars given away
= 40 - 24
= 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount each student raised, we first need to isolate the total amount contributed by the students. Given that the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the students' contribution can be calculated as follows:

Total amount raised by the charity = $175,000
Amount raised by organizations = $50,000
Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by the charity - Amount raised by organizations
= $175,000 - $50,000
= $125,000

Now, to find the amount each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

Amount raised by students = $125,000
Number of students = 20
Amount each student raised = Amount raised by students / Number of students
= $125,000 / 20
= $6,250

Therefore, each student raised $6,250."
"To determine the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

Let's denote the time Sandy walked on the first day as $t_1$ and the time she walked on the second day as $t_2$. We are given that $t_1 = 8$ hours and $t_2 = \frac{1}{2}t_1 = \frac{1}{2}(8) = 4$ hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

$t_1 = 8 \text{ hours} = 8 \times 60 = 480 \text{ minutes}$
$t_2 = 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes}$

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is $t_1 + t_2 = 480 + 240 = 720$ minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{720}$"
"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to calculate the number of cars present in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we need to calculate his daily earnings first. Given that he completes 30 cycles of work per day, each cycle consisting of 5 tasks, and each task paying $1.20, we can calculate his daily earnings as follows:

Daily earnings = 30 × 5 × $1.20
Daily earnings = $180

Now, to find his weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by 7, as there are 7 days in a week.

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings × 7
Weekly earnings = $180 × 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To determine the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to calculate her points in each game and then sum them.

Let's denote Sasha's points in the first game as S1 and Julie's points in the first game as J1. We know that J1 = S1 - 4.

Given that Sasha scored 14 points in the first game, we can substitute S1 = 14 into the equation J1 = S1 - 4, which yields J1 = 14 - 4 = 10.

Now, we need to find Sasha's points in the second game. Let's denote her points in the second game as S2. We are given that S2 = J1 - 6. Substituting J1 = 10 into this equation, we get S2 = 10 - 6 = 4.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her points from both games: S1 + S2 = 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food purchased by Kimberly, we first calculate the total number of tins of each type.

The number of tins of cat food is given by the product of the number of packages of cat food and the number of tins per package: $8 \times 11 = 88$.

Similarly, the number of tins of dog food is given by the product of the number of packages of dog food and the number of tins per package: $6 \times 6 = 36$.

Now, to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: $88 - 36 = 52$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 329/7
x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and add them together.

Let's denote the number of green eggs as G, blue eggs as B, pink eggs as P, and yellow eggs as Y.

We are given the following information:
- G = 5 (number of green eggs)
- B = 2G (number of blue eggs, which is twice the number of green eggs)
- P = B - 1 (number of pink eggs, which is one fewer than the number of blue eggs)
- Y = (1/3)P (number of yellow eggs, which is one-third the number of pink eggs)

Now, let's substitute the expressions for B and P in terms of G:
B = 2G = 2(5) = 10
P = B - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9
Y = (1/3)P = (1/3)(9) = 3

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together:
Total number of eggs = G + B + P + Y
= 5 + 10 + 9 + 3
= 27

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the amount Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

The cost of shipping is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of shipping} = (\text{cost per pound} \times \text{weight of the book}) + (\text{cost per mile} \times \text{distance}) \]
\[ \text{Cost of shipping} = (0.35 \times 4) + (0.08 \times 20) \]
\[ \text{Cost of shipping} = 1.4 + 1.6 \]
\[ \text{Cost of shipping} = 3.00 \]

The refund amount is 75% of the purchase price:
\[ \text{Refund amount} = 0.75 \times 32 \]
\[ \text{Refund amount} = 24 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
\[ \text{Total loss} = \text{cost of shipping} + (\text{purchase price} - \text{refund amount}) \]
\[ \text{Total loss} = 3.00 + (32 - 24) \]
\[ \text{Total loss} = 3.00 + 8 \]
\[ \text{Total loss} = 11.00 \]

The final answer is: $11.00"
"To determine the amount of money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract it from the total amount of money she had initially.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Mulan had as I = $40. Her father gave her an additional amount of money, F = $100. Therefore, the total amount of money she had initially is I + F = $40 + $100 = $140.

Mulan spent money on two pairs of jeans, each costing $30. The total cost of the jeans is 2 * $30 = $60. She also purchased a bag for $20.

The total amount of money she spent is the sum of the cost of the jeans and the bag: $60 + $20 = $80.

To find the amount of money Mulan has left, we subtract the total amount of money she spent from the total amount of money she had initially: $140 - $80 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the production for the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

Let's denote the production for the first week as $W_1 = 8,000$ bars. The production for the second week is half of the first week, which is $W_2 = \frac{1}{2}W_1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 8,000 = 4,000$ bars. The production for the third week is three times the first week, which is $W_3 = 3W_1 = 3 \cdot 8,000 = 24,000$ bars.

The total production for the first three weeks is the sum of the individual weekly productions: $W_{\text{total}} = W_1 + W_2 + W_3 = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000$ bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we can find the production for the fourth week by subtracting the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production:
$W_4 = 50,000 - W_{\text{total}} = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000$ bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14,000}$"
"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends per week and multiply it by 4.

First, let's break down the time Britany spends on TikTok-related activities per week:

1. Writing amateur songs: 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
2. Doing makeup: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes
3. Recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes per video = 72 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok per week by summing up the individual times:
\[ \text{Total weekly time} = 120 + 90 + 72 = 282 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly time to hours, we divide by 60:
\[ \text{Total weekly time in hours} = \frac{282}{60} = 4.7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month by multiplying the total weekly time by 4:
\[ \text{Total monthly time} = 4.7 \text{ hours} \times 4 = 18.8 \text{ hours} \]

The final answer is: $\boxed{18.8}$"
"To determine the total cost of the installation, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items.

The number of additional mirrors is 6 - 4 = 2, the number of additional chandeliers is 2 - 1 = 1, and the number of additional pictures is 20 - 10 = 10.

The cost of the additional mirrors is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00, the cost of the additional chandeliers is 1 * $15.00 = $15.00, and the cost of the additional pictures is 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost is the sum of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To determine the amount of money Roy has saved, we need to calculate 40% more than Anthony's savings. 

First, we establish the amount saved by Anthony, which is $10 more than Eva's savings. Eva has saved $20, so Anthony has saved $20 + $10 = $30.

To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30 by 0.4: $30 × 0.4 = $12.

Now, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings to find the total amount Roy has saved: $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"Given the problem, we can establish a series of ratios to determine Naruto's lifting capacity. Let's denote the height of a mountain that Pompei can lift as $h$. 

Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, Saskay's lifting capacity is $12h$. 

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami's lifting capacity is $4 \times 12h = 48h$.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto's lifting capacity is $10 \times 48h = 480h$.

Given that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, we can substitute $h = 1$ inch into the expression for Naruto's lifting capacity. 

Thus, Naruto can lift a mountain $480h = 480 \times 1 = 480$ inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12, since there are 12 inches in a foot.

$\frac{480}{12} = 40$ feet.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"Given Mason's speed of 8 miles per hour, we can calculate the total distance traveled by applying the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time.

Let's break down the journey into two segments: the first 4 hours and the next 6 hours.

For the first 4 hours, the distance traveled is given by:
d1 = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours, the distance traveled is given by:
d2 = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

To find the total distance traveled, we add the distances of the two segments:
d_total = d1 + d2 = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

Therefore, the total distance traveled by Mason is 80 miles.

The final answer is: 80"
"Given that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take a total of 18 hours to traverse a highway, we can determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to make the same journey. Since the time is inversely proportional to the number of kangaroos, we can calculate the time for one kangaroo as follows:

t_kangaroo = 18 hours * 3 kangaroos = 54 hours

Now, we need to find the time it takes for four turtles to travel at half the speed of a kangaroo. Since speed is inversely proportional to time, and the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, it will take them twice as long to cover the same distance. Therefore, we can calculate the time for four turtles as follows:

t_turtles = 54 hours * 2 = 108 hours

The final answer is: 108"
"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of dishes made by Kora as K, Rory as R, and Jada as J.

Given that Kora made 20 dishes, we have K = 20.

We are also given that Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so we can express this as R = K + 20. Substituting the value of K, we get R = 20 + 20 = 40.

Furthermore, Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, which can be expressed as J = 2R. Substituting the value of R, we get J = 2 * 40 = 80.

To find the total number of dishes made by all three, we add the number of dishes each person made: K + R + J = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To determine the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's help.

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has been paid $150 and her mom gave her $80, so the total amount of money she received is: $150 + $80 = $230.

Now, we know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so the total amount of money she has is the price of the laptop after trading in her old one plus the extra money she needs: $400 + $50 = $450.

Since Erika received $230, the amount of money she had in her purse initially is: $450 - $230 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the number of apple slices left, we need to calculate the total number of slices Adam has and then subtract the number of slices he eats.

First, let's find the total number of slices from the large and small apples. 

The number of slices from 3 large apples is 3 × 5 = 15.
The number of slices from 5 small apples is 5 × 3 = 15.

Now, we add the number of slices from the large and small apples to get the total number of slices: 15 + 15 = 30.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, we subtract this from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left: 30 - 15 = 15.

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is 15."
"To determine the number of cows required to produce 25 liters of milk per day, we can use a simple ratio. The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk per day from each cow. To find the number of cows needed to produce 25 liters of milk per day, we can divide the desired daily milk production by the milk production per cow.

Let's denote the number of cows needed as x. We can set up the following equation:

5x = 25

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 25 / 5
x = 5

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find the difference between the number of cows needed and the number of cows already present:

x - 3 = 5 - 3
x - 3 = 2

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

Let's start by finding the unused portion of each glue stick. We know that a glue stick is 12 millimeters long originally.

For the first glue stick, the unused portion is 1/6 of 12 millimeters. We can calculate this as follows:

$$\frac{1}{6} \cdot 12 = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{12}{1} = \frac{12}{6} = 2 \text{ millimeters}$$

For the second glue stick, the unused portion is 2/3 of 12 millimeters. We can calculate this as follows:

$$\frac{2}{3} \cdot 12 = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{12}{1} = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \text{ millimeters}$$

For the third glue stick, the unused portion is 1/2 of 12 millimeters. We can calculate this as follows:

$$\frac{1}{2} \cdot 12 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{12}{1} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}$$

Now, we add the unused portions together:

$$2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}$$

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount of money Gabriel still needs, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to acquire. The car costs $10000 and the phone costs $800, so the total cost is $10000 + $800 = $10800.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently possesses. He has $5000 from his weekend work and an additional $200 from his brother, resulting in a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

Now, to find the amount of money Gabriel still needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost of the items: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"To determine the change Thea received, we need to calculate the difference between the amount she gave the craftsman and the cost of the hat.

The amount Thea gave the craftsman is $80, which is the product of 4 and $20. This can be expressed as:

4 × 20 = 80

Now, we subtract the cost of the hat, $70, from the total amount given:

80 - 70 = 10

Therefore, Thea received $10 as change."
"To determine the amount of money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

Craig has 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is equivalent to 2 × $20 = $40.

He purchases 6 squirt guns at $2 each, resulting in a total cost of 6 × $2 = $12.

Additionally, he buys 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each, totaling 3 × $3 = $9.

The total amount spent is the sum of the cost of squirt guns and water balloons, which is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

The final answer is: $19"
"Given the problem, we can establish a system of equations to solve for the number of socks and dishes each person has.

Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as S and the number of dishes Jack has as D. We are given that Jack collected 60 dishes, so D = 60.

We are also given that Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so we can write the equation D = 2S. Substituting D = 60, we get 60 = 2S, which implies S = 30.

Now, we are given that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter's socks = 2S = 2(30) = 60.

We are also given that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter's dishes = D/2 = 60/2 = 30.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the number of socks and dishes each person has: Total = S + D + Peter's socks + Peter's dishes = 30 + 60 + 30 + 30 = 150.

However, the question asks for the total number of socks and dishes they have together, which is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To determine the number of students good at math, we can use a Venn diagram or the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's denote the total number of students as T, the number of students good at math as M, the number of students good at English as E, and the number of students good at both as B.

Given:
- T = 20
- M - B = 5 (students good at math only)
- E - B = 8 (students good at English only)
- B = T - (M - B + E - B) (by the principle of inclusion-exclusion)

Simplifying the equation for B:
B = T - (M - B + E - B)
B = T - (M + E - 2B)
B = T - M - E + 2B
B - 2B = T - M - E
-B = T - M - E
B = M + E - T

Now, substitute the value of B in the equation M - B = 5:
M - (M + E - T) = 5
M - M - E + T = 5
-T - E = 5
M = T + E - 5

Substitute the given values:
M = 20 + 8 - 5
M = 23 - 5
M = 18

However, this is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the equation M = T + E - 5. We know that M - B = 5 and E - B = 8. Since B = M + E - T, we can substitute this value of B in the equation M - B = 5:
M - (M + E - T) = 5
M - M - E + T = 5
-T - E = 5
M = T + E - 5

We also know that M + B = T. Substituting B = M + E - T in this equation:
M + (M + E - T) = T
2M + E - T = T
2M + E = 2T
2M + E = 2(20)
2M + E = 40

Now, we have two equations and two variables:
1) M = T + E - 5
2) 2M + E = 40

Substitute the value of M from equation 1 into equation 2:
2(T + E - 5) + E = 40
2T + 2E - 10 + E = 40
2T + 3E - 10 = 40
2T + 3E = 50

We know that T = 20. Substitute this value in the equation:
2(20) + 3E = 50
40 + 3E = 50
3E = 10
E = 10/3

However, E must be a whole number since it represents the number of students. This indicates that our initial assumption of T = 20 might be incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Given:
- Total students = 20
- Students good at math only = 5
- Students good at English only = 8
- Students good at both math and English = Total students - (Students good at math only + Students good at English only)

We also know that the total number of students good at math is equal to the sum of students good at math only and students good at both math and English. This can be represented as:
M = M - B + B
M = M + B - B
M = M

However, this is a tautology. We need to find a different approach.

Let's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion:
M = M - B + B
M = (M - B) + B
M = (Students good at math only) + (Students good at both math and English)
M = 5 + (T - 13)
M = 5 + T - 13

We also know that M + B = T. Substituting B = T - 13 in this equation:
M + (T - 13) = T
M + T - 13 = T
M - 13 = 0

M = (M - B) + B
M = (Students good at math only) + (Students good at both math and English)
M = 5 + (T - 13)
M = 5 + T - 13

We also know that M + B = T. Substituting B = T - 13 in this equation:
M + (T - 13) = T
M + T - 13 = T
M - 13 = 0
M = 13

Since the students good at both math and English are counted in both the math only and English only groups, we need to add them to the students good at math only to get the total number of students good at math.

We also know that the total number of students good at math is equal to the sum of students good at math only and students good at both math and English. This can be represented as:

"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and then divide it by the time each group takes to perform, including getting on and off the stage.

Let's denote the time each group takes to perform as $t_g = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10$ minutes. The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is $2 \times 60 = 120$ minutes. However, we need to subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total time, so the time available for performances is $t_{\text{available}} = 120 - 10 = 110$ minutes.

Now, we can calculate the number of groups that can perform: $n = \frac{t_{\text{available}}}{t_g} = \frac{110}{10} = 11$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to understand that this is a simple interest problem. The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which can be expressed as 0.75x, where x is the principal amount ($300 in this case).

The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, and t is the time period in years.

Given that the interest rate is 0.75x, we can rewrite the formula as I = 0.75x * x * t = 0.75x^2t.

Substituting the given values, we get I = 0.75 * 300^2 * 3 = 0.75 * 90000 * 3 = 202500.

The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the interest: A = P + I = 300 + 202500 = 202800.

The final answer is: $202800"
"To determine the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars, we first need to calculate the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

Let's start with the white shirts. Since half of the 40 white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with collars is 40 / 2 = 20. Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, we'll calculate the number of floral shirts with no buttons. Given that 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars by subtracting the latter from the former: 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the farmer's earnings, we need to calculate the number of trays and then multiply it by the price per tray. 

First, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray:

This means the farmer has 30 trays. Now, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

$$30 \times 2.5 = 75$$

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

We have two farms, Farm X and Farm Y, with initial goat populations of 55 and 45, respectively. Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y. 

First, we calculate the number of goats sold from Farm Y, which is twice the number sold from Farm X. Since 10 goats were sold from Farm X, we have:

Number of goats sold from Farm Y = 2 * 10 = 20

Now, we find the number of goats left in Farm X by subtracting the number sold from the initial population:

Number of goats left in Farm X = 55 - 10 = 45

Similarly, we find the number of goats left in Farm Y by subtracting the number sold from the initial population:

Number of goats left in Farm Y = 45 - 20 = 25

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:

Total number of goats left = 45 + 25 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to calculate the total expenditure on shoes per year and divide it by the number of pairs purchased annually.

Given that James spends $2640 on shoes each year and buys 2 pairs of shoes per month, we can calculate the total number of pairs purchased per year as follows:

Number of pairs per year = 2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Now, we can calculate the average cost per pair by dividing the total expenditure by the number of pairs:

Average cost per pair = Total expenditure per year / Number of pairs per year
= $2640 / 24
= $110

Therefore, the average cost per pair of shoes is $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To determine the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, we need to calculate the cost of each type of basket and then apply the discount for the red food.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is calculated as follows:

3 × $25 = $75

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is calculated as follows:

3 × $18 = $54

The total cost before applying the discount is the sum of the costs of the green and red food baskets:

$75 + $54 = $129

Since a discount of $2 is applied to each basket of red food, the total discount is:

3 × $2 = $6

To find the total cost after the discount, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount:

$129 - $6 = $123

Therefore, the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, with a discount of $2 for each basket of red food, is $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To determine the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms and we want to clean one-half of them, we can express this as a fraction:

90 rooms / 2 = 45 rooms

Now, we need to find the total time it takes to clean 45 rooms. It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so we can multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

45 rooms × 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

900 minutes ÷ 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them together.

Let's denote the number of homes built in the first year as \(H_1 = 12\).

In the second year, the town will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is \(H_2 = 3 \times H_1 = 3 \times 12 = 36\).

To find the number of homes built in the third year, we need to double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(H_1 + H_2 = 12 + 36 = 48\). Doubling this amount gives us \(H_3 = 2 \times (H_1 + H_2) = 2 \times 48 = 96\).

Now, we can find the total number of homes built over the next three years by summing the number of homes built each year: \(H_{\text{total}} = H_1 + H_2 + H_3 = 12 + 36 + 96 = 144\).

The final answer is: $\boxed{144}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's denote my age as x, my brother's age as x + 3, my sister's age as x - 2, and my mom's age as 3(x + 3) - 1.

We know that the sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87

Combine like terms:

5x + 10 + 3x + 8 - 1 = 87

Combine like terms:

8x + 17 = 87

Subtract 17 from both sides:

8x = 70

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 70/8

x = 8.75

However, since age cannot be a decimal, we need to re-examine the equation. Let's try to find a whole number solution.

We can rewrite the equation as:

8x = 70

Since 8x is a multiple of 8, we can try to find a whole number solution by dividing 70 by 8.

70/8 = 8.75

However, we can see that 8.75 is not a whole number. Let's try to find a multiple of 8 that is close to 70.

We can try 8(9) = 72, but this is too large. We can try 8(8) = 64, but this is too small.

However, we can try 8(8) + 6 = 74, but this is still too large. We can try 8(8) + 2 = 70, which is equal to 70.

So, we can rewrite the equation as:

8(8) + 2 = 70

Subtract 2 from both sides:

8(8) = 68

Divide both sides by 8:

8 = 68/8

8 = 8.5

However, we can see that 8.5 is not a whole number. Let's try to find a multiple of 8 that is close to 68.

"To determine the number of packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks per pack.

Let's denote the total number of students as $n$, the number of glue sticks per student as $g$, and the number of glue sticks per pack as $p$. We are given that $n = 27$ and $g = 2$. The total number of glue sticks required is then $n \cdot g = 27 \cdot 2 = 54$.

To find the number of packs required, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack: $\frac{54}{8} = 6.75$.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we must round up to the nearest whole number. This is equivalent to taking the ceiling function of the result, denoted as $\lceil 6.75 \rceil = 7$.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy $\boxed{7}$ packs of glue sticks to ensure every student has 2 glue sticks, with some extra glue sticks left over.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"Given the scenario, we have a river with a varying water flow. Let's denote the initial water flow as $F_1 = 4000$ gallons. On the second day, the water flow doubles, so we have $F_2 = 2F_1 = 2 \cdot 4000 = 8000$ gallons. 

On the third day, the water flow increases by 6000 gallons, so we have $F_3 = F_2 + 6000 = 8000 + 6000 = 14000$ gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to sum the water flows for each day: $F_{\text{total}} = F_1 + F_2 + F_3 = 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000$ gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24000}$"
"This is a classic example of an exponential growth problem, which can be modeled using the concept of a geometric progression. Let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of infected people as $n_0 = 10$ and the number of people each infected person infects as $r = 6$. We want to find the total number of people infected after three days.

The number of people infected on Day 1 is given by $n_1 = n_0 + n_0r = 10 + 10 \cdot 6 = 70$.

The number of people infected on Day 2 is given by $n_2 = n_1 + n_1r = 70 + 70 \cdot 6 = 70 + 420 = 490$.

The number of people infected on Day 3 is given by $n_3 = n_2 + n_2r = 490 + 490 \cdot 6 = 490 + 2940 = 3430$.

However, this is not the total number of people infected after three days. We need to consider the people infected on Day 1 and Day 2 as well. The total number of people infected after three days is given by $n_0 + n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 10 + 70 + 490 + 3430 = 4000$.

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider the people infected on Day 3 as well. The correct total number of people infected after three days is given by $n_0 + n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_3r = 10 + 70 + 490 + 3430 + 3430 \cdot 6 = 10 + 70 + 490 + 3430 + 20580 = 24580$.

The correct total number of people infected after three days is given by $n_0 + n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_3r + n_3r^2 = 10 + 70 + 490 + 3430 + 3430 \cdot 6 + 3430 \cdot 6^2 = 10 + 70 + 490 + 3430 + 20580 + 73860 = 92730$.

"To determine the total amount of money received by Julieta and Rafaela as tips, we first need to calculate the individual amounts they received.

Rafaela received tips from 40 customers, each giving $20. Therefore, her total tips can be calculated as:

Rafaela's tips = 40 \* $20 = $800

Since Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, we can find her total tips by subtracting 10% of Rafaela's tips from Rafaela's total tips. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we multiply her total tips by 0.1:

10% of Rafaela's tips = 0.1 \* $800 = $80

Now, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips to find Julieta's total tips:

Julieta's tips = Rafaela's tips - 10% of Rafaela's tips
= $800 - $80
= $720

The total amount of money they received as tips is the sum of their individual tips:

Total tips = Rafaela's tips + Julieta's tips
= $800 + $720
= $1520

The final answer is: $1520"
"To determine the number of oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. 

Let's denote the number of oranges given to each daughter as D and the number of oranges given to her son as S. We are given that Jennifer has 3 daughters, so the total number of oranges given to her daughters is 3D. We are also given that she gave her son 3 oranges, so S = 3.

We know that Jennifer gave her daughters 2 oranges each, so D = 2. 

Now, we can calculate the total number of oranges given to her children: 3D + S = 3(2) + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges: 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Given the scenario, let's analyze the problem from a mathematical perspective.

Let's denote the time it takes Claire to earn a badge as 't'. Since Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge, the time it takes Amber to earn a badge is 2t. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so the time it takes Wendy to earn a badge is t/3.

The number of badges earned by each person in a 1-year time frame (12 months) can be calculated as follows:

- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: (1/2) badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:

36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final numerical answer is: 30"
"To determine the total amount raised by Paige, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold, and then multiply that by the price per slice.

Given that Paige bakes 2 loaves per hour and she worked for 5 hours, we can calculate the total number of loaves as follows:

2 loaves/hour × 5 hours = 10 loaves

Since each loaf is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

10 loaves × 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is equivalent to 0.5 dollars. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice:

80 slices × 0.5 dollars/slice = 40 dollars

The final answer is: $40"
"Given that Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins and she has 70 gold coins, we can establish a relationship between the number of silver coins (S) and gold coins (G). 

Since G = S + 30 and G = 70, we can set up the equation S + 30 = 70.

To solve for S, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

S + 30 - 30 = 70 - 30
S = 40

Now that we know S = 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins:

Total coins = S + G
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos, we need to calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students and Mr. George.

First, let's calculate the total number of burritos eaten by the students. There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. This can be represented as:

Total burritos eaten by students = Number of students * Number of burritos per student
= 50 * 10
= 500

Next, we need to account for the burritos eaten by Mr. George. It is given that he ate 20 burritos.

Total burritos eaten = Total burritos eaten by students + Burritos eaten by Mr. George
= 500 + 20
= 520

Now, we can find the total number of leftover burritos by subtracting the total number of burritos eaten from the initial number of burritos ordered:

Total leftover burritos = Initial number of burritos - Total burritos eaten
= 600 - 520
= 80

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink, we need to apply basic algebraic principles and logical reasoning.

Let's denote the number of red cars as R, the number of green cars as G, the number of blue cars as B, and the number of yellow cars as Y. We are given the following information:

1. R = 12 (number of red cars)
2. G = R - 2 (number of green cars is 2 fewer than red cars)
3. B = 3G (number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars)
4. R + G + B + Y = 75 (total number of cars in the rink)

Substituting the given values, we get:

12 + (12 - 2) + 3(12 - 2) + Y = 75

Simplifying the equation:

12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75

Combine like terms:

52 + Y = 75

Subtract 52 from both sides:

Y = 23

Therefore, the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink is 23.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We are given two equations:

1. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
2. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can express S in terms of F by substituting the second equation into the first equation:

S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

We also know that the total number of books is 85, so we can write the equation:

S + A + F = 85

Substituting the expression for S into this equation, we get:

(F + 13) + A + F = 85

Combine like terms:

2F + A + 13 = 85

Now, substitute the expression for A into this equation:

2F + (F - 12) + 13 = 85

Combine like terms:

3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

F = 28

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To determine the weight of the carrots, we need to first calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Sweet Potatoes = 2 * Potatoes
Sweet Potatoes = 2 * 5
Sweet Potatoes = 10 pounds

Now, we know that the carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. This can be expressed as:

Carrots = Sweet Potatoes - 3
Carrots = 10 - 3
Carrots = 7 pounds

Therefore, the weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To determine the total cost of Jello for Greg's son's birthday party, we need to calculate the total number of Jello cups required and then multiply it by the cost per box.

First, we calculate the total number of Jello cups needed. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 Jello cups, the total number of Jello cups required is 30 * 4 = 120.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of Jello are needed. Since one box of Jello makes 10 Jello cups, the number of boxes required is 120 / 10 = 12.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes by the cost per box. The cost of one box of Jello is $1.25, so the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the change the seller will receive, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones and subtract it from the amount given.

The cost of each phone is $700, and the seller purchased 5 phones. Therefore, the total cost of the phones is:

5 × $700 = $3500

Now, we need to find the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount given:

$4000 - $3500 = $500

This is a straightforward arithmetic operation, and the result is a simple subtraction. The change the seller will receive is $500."
"To determine the amount Keenan spends per week, we first need to calculate his monthly expenditure. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

The total monthly expenditure is $400. To find 40% of this amount, we multiply $400 by 0.4:

$$\frac{40}{100} \times 400 = 0.4 \times 400 = 160$$

Now that we know Keenan's monthly expenditure, we can calculate his weekly expenditure by dividing the monthly amount by the number of weeks in a month, which is 4:

$$\frac{160}{4} = 40$$

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he consumed on each day and sum them up.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we can express this as a fraction and perform the division:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \text{ pieces} \]

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's calculate the number of pieces he ate on the third day. We need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days:
\[ 60 - 24 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we'll find 7/13 of the remaining pieces:
\[ \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = \frac{7 \times 26}{13} = \frac{182}{13} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate on each day:
\[ 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \text{ pieces} \]

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we need to establish the unit prices of each item. 

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the unit price of a bottle of soda is calculated as follows:

$$\frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00$$

Therefore, the unit price of a bottle of soda is $3.00.

Similarly, the cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the unit price of a bottle of water is calculated as follows:

$$\frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00$$

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water by multiplying the unit prices by the respective quantities:

$$3 \times 3.00 = 9.00$$
$$2 \times 2.00 = 4.00$$

The total cost is the sum of the costs of the soda and water:

$$9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00$$

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To determine the amount of money David has left after purchasing the bolts, we need to perform a simple subtraction operation.

Let's denote the initial amount of money David has as $12.48 and the cost of each bolt as $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, we can calculate the total cost of the bolts by multiplying the cost per bolt by the number of bolts:

Total cost of bolts = 16 \* $0.03
Total cost of bolts = $0.48

Now, we can subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

Remaining amount = Initial amount - Total cost of bolts
Remaining amount = $12.48 - $0.48
Remaining amount = $12.00

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after purchasing the bolts."
"To determine Ella's earnings after 12 hours of dog walking at the same rate, we first need to calculate her hourly wage. This can be done by dividing the total amount earned ($33) by the number of hours worked (3).

$$\text{Hourly wage} = \frac{\text{Total amount earned}}{\text{Number of hours worked}} = \frac{\$33}{3} = \$11$$

Now that we have her hourly wage, we can calculate her earnings after 12 hours by multiplying the hourly wage by the number of hours worked.

$$\text{Earnings after 12 hours} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Number of hours worked} = \$11 \times 12 = \$132$$

The final answer is: $132"
"To determine the number of marbles Paul has left, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after receiving the gift from his friend. This can be done by adding the initial number of marbles (52) to the number of marbles received (28).

52 + 28 = 80

Next, we need to find 1/4 of the total number of marbles. To do this, we can multiply the total number of marbles by 1/4, which is equivalent to dividing by 4.

1/4 × 80 = 80 ÷ 4 = 20

Now, we subtract the number of marbles lost (20) from the total number of marbles after receiving the gift (80) to find the number of marbles Paul has left.

80 - 20 = 60

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she gets from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Since Amy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 80 by 100: 0.8. Then, we multiply this decimal by the number of multiple-choice questions (10) and the point value of each question (1): 0.8 * 10 * 1 = 8 points.

Next, we calculate the points from the true/false questions. Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions. We express this as a decimal by dividing 90 by 100: 0.9. Then, we multiply this decimal by the number of true/false questions (20) and the point value of each question (1): 0.9 * 20 * 1 = 18 points.

Finally, we calculate the points from the long-answer questions. Amy correctly answers 60% of the 5 long-answer questions. We express this as a decimal by dividing 60 by 100: 0.6. Then, we multiply this decimal by the number of long-answer questions (5) and the point value of each question (5): 0.6 * 5 * 5 = 15 points.

Now, we add the points from each type of question to find Amy's total score: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{41}$"
"To determine the cost price of the chickens, we first need to find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as:

$$\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180$$

This means Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens. Given that he sells each chicken at $50, the total revenue from selling the chickens is:

$$180 \times 50 = 9000$$

However, we are told that he needs to make a profit of $2000. To find the total amount he needs to make from selling the chickens, we add the profit to the revenue:

$$9000 + 2000 = 11000$$

Since he will make $9000 from selling the chickens, we can set up the equation:

$$9000 = 180 \times \text{cost price} + 2000$$

To find the cost price, we can rearrange the equation:

$$\text{cost price} = \frac{9000 - 2000}{180}$$

$$\text{cost price} = \frac{7000}{180}$$

$$\text{cost price} = 38.89$$

The final answer is: $38.89"
"To determine the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah, we first need to calculate the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell. Since they sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses sold by 2.

Let's denote the total number of glasses sold as $T$, the number of glasses sold by Julie as $J$, and the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell as $M$. We are given that $T = 32$ and $J = 14$. We can express the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell as $M = \frac{T}{2} = \frac{32}{2} = 16$.

Now, we can find the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah by subtracting the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie: $J - M = 14 - 16 = -2$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-2}$"
"To determine the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

Let's denote the cost of the hair service as H, the cost of the manicure as M, and the cost of the pedicure as P.

We are given that H = $400, M = 1/4H, and P = 3/4M.

First, we can express M in terms of H: M = 1/4H = $400/4 = $100.

Next, we can express P in terms of M: P = 3/4M = 3/4($100) = $75.

Now, we can add the costs together: H + M + P = $400 + $100 + $75 = $575.

Therefore, the total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575.

The final answer is: $575"
"To determine the amount of money Sarah will have left over after purchasing the new rope, we need to calculate the profit from selling the original rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling the rope. Given that the rope is 20 meters long and her friend is willing to buy it for $2 per meter, the revenue can be calculated as follows:

Revenue = Length of rope (m) × Price per meter ($)
= 20 m × $2/m
= $40

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and Sarah plans to buy a rope of the same length (20 meters). Therefore, the cost of the new rope is:

Cost of new rope = Length of new rope (m) × Price per meter ($)
= 20 m × $1.5/m
= $30

Now, let's calculate the profit by subtracting the cost of the new rope from the revenue:

Profit = Revenue - Cost of new rope
= $40 - $30
= $10

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after purchasing the new rope.

The final answer is: $10"
"To determine when Melanie's age will be thrice her present age, we can start by defining her current age as 'x'. Since in 10 years, she will be 18 years old, we can express her current age as x = 18 - 10 = 8.

Now, let's consider the time it takes for her age to be thrice her present age. At that point, her age will be 3x. We can set up the equation: x + t = 3x, where 't' represents the number of years it takes for her age to be thrice her present age.

Simplifying the equation, we get t = 2x. Since we know her current age is 8, we can substitute x = 8 into the equation to find t: t = 2(8) = 16.

Therefore, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10. 

The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120, since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.

The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14, since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.

The total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart is $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

Since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly has overspent her budget by $91.

The amount of money Kelly has left in her budget is $0.

$0"
"To determine the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the runtime of her usual concert as x minutes. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x minutes. Additionally, the encore is 15 minutes long. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, so we can write the equation:

2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

Therefore, the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"

"To determine the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to calculate the sum of the chimichangas produced on each day. 

Let's denote the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday as T and W, respectively. We are given that T = W = 125. 

The number of chimichangas made on Friday is twice the number made on Tuesday and Wednesday, so F = 2T = 2W = 2(125) = 250.

Now, we can calculate the total number of chimichangas made on those three days by adding the number of chimichangas made on each day: T + W + F = 125 + 125 + 250 = 500.

The final answer is: $\boxed{500}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage, given that 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in.

Let's denote the total number of microphones as M. We know that 80% of M will be arranged in pairs, which means 0.8M microphones will be arranged in pairs. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of pairs is 0.8M / 2.

We are given that M = 50. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

0.8M / 2 = 0.8(50) / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and then sum them up.

First, let's consider the birds nesting in the bushes. We have a fixed number of 6 birds.

Next, we have birds flying overhead, which is 2/3 of the number of birds nesting in the bushes. To find this, we multiply 6 by 2/3:

$$\frac{2}{3} \cdot 6 = 4$$

So, there are 4 birds flying overhead.

Now, let's consider the birds feeding. We have 3 groups of 8 birds each, so the total number of birds feeding is:

$$3 \cdot 8 = 24$$

To find the total number of birds, we add the number of birds in each group:

$$6 + 4 + 24 = 34$$

Therefore, Jerry counts a total of 34 birds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"

"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we can break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, we identify the total number of plants, which is given as 100. We then calculate the number of indoor plants, which is one-fourth of the total: $\frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25$ indoor plants.

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75. We then find the number of outdoor plants, which is two-thirds of the remaining plants: $\frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50$ outdoor plants.

The number of flowering plants is the remaining portion, which is 75 - 50 = 25 plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula: $\frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \times 100\% = \frac{25}{100} \times 100\% = 25\%$.

Therefore, the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden is 25%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, whatchamacallit, and thingamabob. Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as 'x'. 

Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, its speed can be expressed as 11x. We are given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5x
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

The final answer is: 55"
"To determine the cost of one carrot, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of one carrot as 'x'. Since Ellen eats two carrots, the total cost of the carrots is 2x.

We know that the salad costs $6 and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is $3. The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11.

The equation representing the total cost is: 2x + 6 + 3 = 11

Combine the constants: 2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2: x = 1

Therefore, the cost of one carrot is $1."
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the total number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's hourly wage was increased by $2, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, which is a total of 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we can calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's analyze the problem. We are given that Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We also know that she mowed Joe's lawn once, and her payment for that is $6. 

Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as x. Then, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x, and the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is the sum of the payments for each lawn, which is $6 + 18x + 30x = 6 + 48x.

We can set up the equation: 6 + 48x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

Simplifying the equation, we get 48x + y = 74.

Since we want to find the amount she made from lemonade sales, we need to isolate y. Subtracting 48x from both sides of the equation, we get y = 74 - 48x.

However, we don't know the value of x. We can use the fact that she mowed Joe's lawn once, so x = 1. Substituting this value into the equation, we get y = 74 - 48(1) = 74 - 48 = 26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To determine Harry's weight, we can establish a sequence of relationships between the individuals' weights.

Let's denote Martin's weight as M, Carl's weight as C, Christian's weight as Ch, and Harry's weight as H.

Given that Martin's weight is 55 kg, we have M = 55.

Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so we can express this as C = M + 16. Substituting M = 55, we get C = 55 + 16 = 71.

Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, which can be represented as Ch = C + 8. Substituting C = 71, we get Ch = 71 + 8 = 79.

Finally, Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so we can express this as H = Ch - 5. Substituting Ch = 79, we get H = 79 - 5 = 74.

Therefore, Harry's weight is 74 kg.

The final answer is: $\boxed{74}$"
"To determine John's profit from renting his car, we need to calculate his total earnings and subtract his car payment.

First, let's calculate the total earnings from renting his car. We know that he rents it 10 times a month for 3 hours each time and gets paid $25 per hour.

Total earnings = Number of rentals * Number of hours per rental * Hourly rate
Total earnings = 10 * 3 * $25
Total earnings = $750

Now, we need to subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit.

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

Therefore, John's profit from renting his car is $250.

"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Given that Martha initially had 2 notebooks (since she bought 5 more and now has a total of 7), we can determine the number of notebooks Joseph had. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, we can express this relationship as:

J = 3M

where J is the number of notebooks Joseph had, and M is the number of notebooks Martha had. We know that M = 2, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

J = 3(2)
J = 6

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of notebooks Martha has and the number of notebooks Joseph has. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. The difference is:

Δ = M - J
Δ = 7 - 6
Δ = 1

Therefore, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"Given that Dijana rowed 50 miles and Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate the distance rowed by Anis as follows:

Let's denote the distance rowed by Dijana as D = 50 miles. The distance rowed by Anis is 1/5 times more than Dijana's distance, which can be expressed as D + (1/5)D.

To find 1/5 of D, we multiply D by 1/5, which is (1/5) * 50 = 10 miles.

Now, we add this to Dijana's distance to find Anis's distance: D + (1/5)D = 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis is the sum of their individual distances: D + (1/5)D = 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"

"To determine the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel, we need to calculate their total pages read.

Let's denote the number of pages Denise read yesterday as D_yesterday and the number of pages Daniel read yesterday as D_yesterday as well. We are given that D_yesterday = 10 for Denise and D_yesterday = 13 for Daniel.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which can be expressed as D_today = D_yesterday + 5. Substituting the value of D_yesterday for Daniel, we get D_today = 13 + 5 = 18.

Daniel did not read any pages today, so D_today = 0 for Daniel.

The total number of pages read by Denise is the sum of the pages read yesterday and today, which is D_total = D_yesterday + D_today = 10 + 18 = 28.

The total number of pages read by Daniel is the sum of the pages read yesterday, which is D_total = D_yesterday = 13.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is D_total_Denise - D_total_Daniel = 28 - 13 = 15.

"To determine the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the total number of child's bowls that can be filled from the remaining soup.

Let's denote the number of child's bowls that can be filled from the pot as C. Since the pot can fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls, we can set up the following proportion:

4 adult's bowls = 8 child's bowls

We know that 4 adult's bowls were used for dinner, which is equivalent to 4 child's bowls. Therefore, the number of child's bowls used for dinner is 4.

The number of child's bowls left over is C - 4. Since each child eats one bowl for lunch, we want to find the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, which is (C - 4) / 2.

We know that the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, so C = 8. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

(C - 4) / 2 = (8 - 4) / 2
= 4 / 2
= 2

Therefore, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"To determine the total material required for Jo's face masks, we need to calculate the material needed for small and large masks separately and then sum them.

Let's start by finding the material required for small masks. We know that 2 yards of material can make 4 small masks. To find the material needed per small mask, we divide the total material by the number of masks:

Material per small mask = 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards per mask

Now, we can calculate the material needed for 20 small masks by multiplying the material per small mask by the number of small masks:

Material needed for 20 small masks = 20 * 0.5 yards = 10 yards

Next, we'll find the material required for large masks. We know that 2.25 yards of material can make 3 large masks. To find the material needed per large mask, we divide the total material by the number of masks:

Material per large mask = 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards per mask

Now, we can calculate the material needed for 8 large masks by multiplying the material per large mask by the number of large masks:

Material needed for 8 large masks = 8 * 0.75 yards = 6 yards

To find the total material needed, we add the material required for small and large masks:

Total material needed = Material for small masks + Material for large masks = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to calculate the total number of tickets she purchased and divide the total amount she spent by this quantity.

Since Deepa saw each of the 9 movies three times, the total number of tickets she bought is given by the product of the number of movies and the number of times she saw each movie: 9 * 3 = 27 tickets.

The total amount she spent is $216.

The average price per ticket is calculated as the total amount spent divided by the total number of tickets:

$$\frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Total number of tickets}} = \frac{216}{27}$$

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

$$\frac{216}{27} = \frac{8 \cdot 27}{27} = 8$$

Therefore, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8.

"To determine Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends on activities such as sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Let's denote the total hours in a day as H. We know that H = 24.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, which we can represent as S = 10. His work hours are 2 less than his sleep hours, so we can express this as W = S - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8. Lastly, he walks his dog for 1 hour, which we can denote as D = 1.

Now, we can calculate the total hours spent on these activities by adding them together: T = S + W + D = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19.

To find Harold's free time, we subtract the total hours spent from the total hours in a day: F = H - T = 24 - 19 = 5.

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time in a day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of red shoeboxes used by Tim. Since he used 1/3 of his red shoeboxes, we can find this by dividing the total number of red shoeboxes by 3.

Let's denote the total number of red shoeboxes as R. We know that 1/3 of R is used, so we can set up the equation:

1/3 * R = 3

To solve for R, we can multiply both sides by 3:

R = 3 * 3
R = 9

So, Tim used 3 red shoeboxes. Now, we can find the number of red shoeboxes left by subtracting the number used from the total:

Red shoeboxes left = R - 3
= 9 - 3
= 6

Similarly, we can find the number of blue shoeboxes left by subtracting the number used from the total:

Blue shoeboxes left = 7 - 3
= 4

Therefore, the total number of shoeboxes left is the sum of the blue and red shoeboxes left:

Total shoeboxes left = 4 (blue) + 6 (red)
= 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of books Joseph currently has, we need to consider the initial number of books he had, which is twice the number of books Sarah has. Since Sarah has 9 books, we can express this relationship as:

Joseph's initial books = 2 * Sarah's books
= 2 * 9
= 18

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had:

Joseph's current books = Joseph's initial books - 2
= 18 - 2
= 16

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To determine the number of marbles Dean has left, we need to calculate the total number of marbles he gave away and subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's find 1/5 of 30, which is the fraction of marbles Dean gave to Jamie. This can be calculated as:

$$\frac{1}{5} \times 30 = \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{30}{1} = \frac{30}{5} = 6$$

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, he gave 10 marbles to Donald.

The total number of marbles given away is the sum of the marbles given to Jamie and Donald:

$$6 + 10 = 16$$

Now, we subtract the total number of marbles given away from the initial amount to find the number of marbles left for Dean:

$$30 - 16 = 14$$

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a relationship between Duncan's and Adam's ages using algebra. Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. 

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
(60 - 8) = 2x
52 = 2x
x = 26

Now, we need to find Adam's current age. Since Adam's age four years ago was 26, his current age is 26 + 4 = 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age: 30 + 8 = 38.

The final answer is: $\boxed{38}$"
"To determine the total acres of both farms, we need to calculate the acres of Farmer Smith's farm first. Since his farm is 100 acres more than twice the acres of Farmer Brown's farm, we can express this as an algebraic expression: 2x + 100, where x is the acres of Farmer Brown's farm.

Given that Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, we can substitute x = 200 into the expression to find the acres of Farmer Smith's farm:

2(200) + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500 acres

Now, we can find the total acres of both farms by adding the acres of Farmer Brown's farm and Farmer Smith's farm:

200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres

Therefore, the total acres of both farms is 700.

The final answer is: 700"
"To determine Colby's earnings in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Let's denote the number of packages Colby completes per hour as P. We are given that P is 10 less than 50, so we can express this as P = 50 - 10.

P = 50 - 10
P = 40

Now, we need to find the total number of packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works.

Total packages = P * 8
Total packages = 40 * 8
Total packages = 320

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day are given by the product of the total number of packages and his hourly wage.

Total earnings = Total packages * $0.20
Total earnings = 320 * $0.20
Total earnings = $64

Therefore, Colby's earnings in a typical eight-hour workday are $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To determine the number of bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve the puzzle and then divide it by the time interval at which he drinks a bottle.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes to solve. An extreme sudoku, being a more complex variant, takes 4 times as long, which is 4 × 45 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes, we can calculate the number of bottles he drinks by dividing the total time by the time interval:

$$\frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles}$$

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water while solving an extreme sudoku.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as y. Since there are 20 red balloons, the total number of balloons is 20 + y.

The total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40, and the total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3y. The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, so we can set up the equation:

40 + 3y = 58

To solve for y, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

3y = 18

Then, we divide both sides by 3:

y = 18/3
y = 6

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon's car requires, we need to calculate the total miles driven in 30 days. Given that he drives 100 miles per day, the total miles driven can be calculated as follows:

Total miles driven = 100 miles/day * 30 days
= 100 * 30
= 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can find the number of tune-ups required by dividing the total miles driven by 1000:

Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven / 1000
= 3000 / 1000
= 3

Therefore, Jon's car will require 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To determine the total hours Bruce works over the three days, we can calculate the hours worked each day and then sum them up.

Let's denote the hours worked on Tuesday as T. Given that Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday, we have T = 5.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so the hours worked on Wednesday can be expressed as 2T. Substituting the value of T, we get 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which can be represented as 2T - 2. Substituting the value of 2T, we get 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total hours worked by adding the hours worked each day: T + 2T + (2T - 2) = 5 + 10 + 8.

Combining like terms, we get 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the amount of allowance each girl received, we need to calculate the total amount spent and then divide it by 2.

The cost of the cake is $11. 

The cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, the number of 2-balloon sets is 12 / 2 = 6. So, the cost of 1 dozen balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2: $\frac{28}{2} = 14$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total number of fruits Kira purchased, we need to calculate the sum of the individual quantities of each type of fruit. This can be expressed as:

Total Fruits = Apples + Bananas + Oranges
Total Fruits = 3 + 5 + 6

Using basic arithmetic operations, we can simplify this expression:

Total Fruits = 14

However, since Lola consumed 2 pieces of the fruit, we need to subtract this quantity from the total to find the remaining number of fruits:

Remaining Fruits = Total Fruits - Consumed Fruits
Remaining Fruits = 14 - 2

Performing the subtraction, we get:

Remaining Fruits = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students participating in each sport and then sum them up.

Let's start by identifying the number of students playing tennis. We are given that there are 6 students playing tennis.

Next, we need to find the number of students playing volleyball. Since it's stated that there are twice as many students playing volleyball as there are playing tennis, we can express this as a simple multiplication: 2 * 6 = 12.

Moving on to soccer, we have 16 boys and 22 girls participating. To find the total number of students playing soccer, we simply add the number of boys and girls: 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students by adding the number of students playing each sport: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To determine the profit made from selling lollipops, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

The total revenue can be calculated by multiplying the number of students, the number of lollipops sold per student, and the price per lollipop. 

Total revenue = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student * $0.8/lollipop
Total revenue = 300 * $0.8
Total revenue = $240

The total cost is found by multiplying the number of students, the number of lollipops sold per student, and the cost per lollipop.

Total cost = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student * $0.5/lollipop
Total cost = 300 * $0.5
Total cost = $150

Now, we can calculate the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = $240 - $150
Total profit = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them up.

Let's start by identifying the number of cats, which is given as 3.

Since Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats, we can express this as a multiplication equation: dogs = 3 * cats. Substituting the given value for cats, we get dogs = 3 * 3 = 9.

Next, we know that Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. This can be expressed as a subtraction equation: rabbits = dogs - 2. Substituting the value for dogs, we get rabbits = 9 - 2 = 7.

Now, we're told that Larry has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. This can be expressed as a multiplication equation: fish = 3 * rabbits. Substituting the value for rabbits, we get fish = 3 * 7 = 21.

Finally, we're given that Larry has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. This can be expressed as a division equation: gerbils = fish / 3. Substituting the value for fish, we get gerbils = 21 / 3 = 7.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: total pets = cats + dogs + rabbits + fish + gerbils = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47.

The final answer is: $\boxed{47}$"
"Given that a loaf of bread has 24 slices and Abby can eat 2 slices a day, while Josh can eat twice as much, we can calculate their combined daily consumption.

Let's denote Abby's daily consumption as A = 2 slices and Josh's daily consumption as J = 2A = 2 * 2 = 4 slices.

Their combined daily consumption is A + J = 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we divide the total number of slices by their combined daily consumption: 24 / 6 = 4.

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To determine the number of shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the total number of months she has been collecting shells. Since Martha collects one shell per month, we can use the formula:

Total number of shells = Number of years * 12 (months/year)

Given that Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old and has been collecting for 5 years by her 10th birthday, we can substitute the values into the formula:

Total number of shells = 5 years * 12 months/year
Total number of shells = 5 * 12
Total number of shells = 60

Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups used for mint tea. Since Lana brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea and the remaining cups are divided into 3 rows with equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let x be the number of cups of mint tea in each row. Then, the total number of cups of mint tea is 3x. The total number of cups of chamomile tea is also 3x. The total number of cups of tea is 27, and the total number of cups of cinnamon tea is 15. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3x + 3x + 15 = 27

Combine like terms:

6x + 15 = 27

Subtract 15 from both sides:

6x = 12

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 2

However, this is the number of cups of mint tea in each row, but we need to find the total number of cups of mint tea. Since there are 3 rows, the total number of cups of mint tea is 3x = 3 * 2 = 6. But this is not the answer we are looking for. We are looking for the number of cups of mint tea in each row, which is 2."
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to consider the total time available and the time required for each round trip. Given that the sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips.

Let's denote the number of berries the sloth picks up per trip as 'b'. Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he can make 2 trips, we can set up the equation:

2b = 24

To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to solve for 'b':

b = 24 / 2
b = 12

Therefore, the sloth can pick up 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we first need to calculate the initial amount of water transferred to the tank. Given that the pool contains 10,000 gallons of water and the tank is filled with half of this amount, we can express this as:

Initial water in tank = (1/2) × 10,000 gallons

Using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can simplify this expression to:

Initial water in tank = 5,000 gallons

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so the total amount of water used is:

Total water used = 500 gallons/day × 6 days
= 500 × 6
= 3,000 gallons

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount:

Remaining water in tank = Initial water in tank - Total water used
= 5,000 gallons - 3,000 gallons
= 2,000 gallons

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"Given Colby's monthly budget of $150, we need to determine how many movies he can see, considering he has already spent money on 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays ($10 each), 8 movies on other days ($7 each), 2 tubs of popcorn ($8 each), and 4 boxes of candy ($2 each).

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on movies:

$$\text{Total spent on movies} = (5 \times 10) + (8 \times 7) = 50 + 56 = 106$$

Next, we calculate the total amount spent on snacks:

$$\text{Total spent on snacks} = (2 \times 8) + (4 \times 2) = 16 + 8 = 24$$

Now, we can find the total amount spent:

$$\text{Total spent} = \text{Total spent on movies} + \text{Total spent on snacks} = 106 + 24 = 130$$

The amount left in Colby's budget is:

$$\text{Amount left} = 150 - 130 = 20$$

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see one more movie on a Friday or Saturday. This leaves him with:

$$\text{Amount left for other days} = 20 - 10 = 10$$

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see:

$$\text{Movies on other days} = \left\lfloor \frac{10}{7} \right\rfloor = 1$$

In total, Colby can see:

$$\text{Total movies} = 1 + 1 = 2$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

Let's start with the mini cinnamon rolls. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 600 = 200$ calories. Since Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, the total calories from cinnamon rolls are $200 \cdot 200 = 40,000$ calories.

Next, let's consider the mini blueberry muffins. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 450 = 150$ calories. Since Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, the total calories from blueberry muffins are $300 \cdot 150 = 45,000$ calories.

The total calories from both types of pastries are $40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000$ calories.

The final answer is: $\boxed{85000}$"
"To calculate the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to find the total number of Junebugs she removed and divide it by the number of days.

Let's start by calculating the total number of Junebugs removed. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs per day. So, for Tuesday and Wednesday, the total is 78 + 78 = 156 Junebugs. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs, and on Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days = 300 / 5 = 60

The average number of Junebugs removed per day is 60."
"To determine the distance each vehicle traveled, we can apply the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time. 

For the bus, traveling at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, the distance traveled is 60 mph * 5 h = 300 miles.

For the car, traveling at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, the distance traveled is 30 mph * 8 h = 240 miles.

To find the difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus: 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the number of bouncy balls, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of toys after purchasing the bouncy balls and the total number of toys before the purchase.

Let's denote the number of blocks as B, the number of stuffed animals as A, the number of rings as R, and the number of bouncy balls as x. We are given the following information:

B = 31
A = 8
R = 9
Total number of toys after purchasing bouncy balls = B + A + R + x = 62

We can now solve for x by rearranging the equation:

x = Total number of toys after purchasing bouncy balls - (B + A + R)
x = 62 - (31 + 8 + 9)
x = 62 - 48
x = 14

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Given the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, and Paul is 10 years older than Jean, while Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, we can establish the following system of equations:

Let P represent Peter's age, Pp represent Paul's age, and J represent Jean's age.

1. P + Pp + J = 100
2. Pp = J + 10
3. P = Pp + J

From equation 2, we can substitute Pp with J + 10 in equation 1:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now, we can substitute P with Pp + J in the equation P + 2J + 10 = 100:
(Pp + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Substitute Pp with J + 10:
(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 80/4
J = 20

Now that we have J, we can find Pp:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 20 + 10
Pp = 30

Now that we have Pp, we can find P:
P = Pp + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total number of water balloons, we can use a simple arithmetic approach. Initially, Maria had 1 water balloon, and her 4 friends each had 2 balloons. This gives us a total of:

1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9

Next, Maria's mom gave each person 3 additional balloons. Since there are 5 people, the total number of additional balloons is:

5 * 3 = 15

Now, we can find the total number of balloons by adding the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:

9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24

Therefore, the total number of water balloons is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of tables required for the charity yard sale, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have and then divide that by the number of boxes that can fit per table.

First, let's calculate the total number of boxes. The charity group has 10 people donating 5 boxes each, so the total number of boxes from donations is 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. They already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Now, we need to divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes that can fit per table, which is 2. So, the number of tables required is 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, they already own 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables required: 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 more tables for the yard sale.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To calculate the average total distance spat, we need to determine the total distance spat by each participant and then divide by the total number of seeds.

Let's denote Zoey's total distance as $Z$ and Sydney's total distance as $S$. Given that Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet, we can express her total distance as $Z = 40 \cdot 10 = 400$ feet. Similarly, Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet, so her total distance is $S = 35 \cdot 12 = 420$ feet.

The total distance spat is the sum of Zoey's and Sydney's distances, which is $Z + S = 400 + 420 = 820$ feet. To find the average total distance spat, we divide this sum by the total number of seeds, which is $40 + 35 = 75$ seeds.

Therefore, the average total distance spat is $\frac{Z + S}{40 + 35} = \frac{820}{75} = \frac{164}{15} = 10.933\ldots$ feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10.93}$"
"To determine the difference in revenue between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

"To determine the cost of Cameron's stay, we need to calculate the cost of the 24-hour option and the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours.

Let's denote the cost of the 12-hour stay as C12 and the cost of the additional hours as Cadd. The cost of the 24-hour stay is given as 1600 pesos.

C12 = 1000 pesos (given)
Cadd = 70 pesos per hour

Cameron stays for 17 hours, which includes the initial 12 hours and 5 additional hours. Therefore, the cost of the additional hours is:

Cadd = 70 * 5 = 350 pesos

The total cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is:

Ctotal = C12 + Cadd = 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour option:

Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the 12-hour option plus the additional hours over the 24-hour option.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To determine the total amount of hay needed, we must first calculate the amount each sheep requires. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can express this relationship as:

Let g represent the amount each goat needs (g = 5 pounds)
Let s represent the amount each sheep needs (s = 2g - 3)

Substituting g = 5 into the equation for s, we get:
s = 2(5) - 3
s = 10 - 3
s = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 15 * 5 = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 12 * 7 = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: 159"
"To determine the number of 25 dollar pens John can buy after his expenses, we need to calculate his remaining funds after accounting for gas and the bank deposit.

First, let's calculate John's earnings: 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars.

Next, we subtract the gas cost and the bank deposit from his earnings: 300 - 50 - 100 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pencils: 5 * 10 = 50 dollars.

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from John's remaining funds: 150 - 50 = 100 dollars.

To find the number of 25 dollar pens John can buy, we divide his remaining funds by the cost of each pen: 100 / 25 = 4.

Therefore, John can buy 4 pens with his remaining funds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Given that Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each, we can calculate the total number of letters in the words he spelled as follows:

Total number of letters in Craig's words = Number of words × Number of letters per word
= 20 × 15
= 20 × (10 × 1 + 5)
= 200 + 20 × 5
= 200 + 100
= 300

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters in Craig's words and his brother's words:

Total number of letters = Total number of letters in Craig's words + Total number of letters in his brother's words
= 300 + 350
= 650

"To determine the total number of children participating in the drill, we need to calculate the total number of children by multiplying the number of children in each row by the number of rows and then by the number of schools.

Given:
- Number of children in each row: 8
- Number of rows: 7
- Number of schools: 5

We can express this as a mathematical equation:

Total number of children = (Number of children in each row) × (Number of rows) × (Number of schools)
Total number of children = 8 × 7 × 5

Using the associative property of multiplication, we can rearrange the equation to simplify the calculation:

Total number of children = (8 × 7) × 5
Total number of children = 56 × 5
Total number of children = 280

Therefore, the total number of children participating in the drill is 280."
"To determine the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to calculate the total number of bottles given to the students and subtract that from the total number of bottles she obtained.

First, let's find the total number of bottles given to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice. This can be represented as:

Total bottles given to students = 29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles

Next, we need to find the total number of bottles the teacher obtained. She has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. This can be represented as:

Total bottles obtained = 9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Now, to find the number of bottles the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she obtained:

Bottles left = Total bottles obtained - Total bottles given to students
             = 900 - 58
             = 842

The final answer is: $\boxed{842}$"
"To calculate the total amount Patty charged for the job, we need to consider the labor cost, parts cost, and the visit fee.

Labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked by the hourly rate. In this case, the job took 2.25 hours, and the labor rate is $35 per hour. Therefore, the labor cost is:

2.25 hours × $35/hour = $78.75

The cost of parts used for the job is $60.

The visit fee is a flat rate of $40.

To find the total amount charged, we add the labor cost, parts cost, and visit fee:

Total cost = Labor cost + Parts cost + Visit fee
Total cost = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To determine the amount James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs, the revenue from selling the unwanted CDs, and then find the difference between the two.

The original price of 10 CDs is $15 each, so the total cost is:

$$\text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 15 = 150$$

Since James received a 40% discount, we subtract the discount from the total cost:

$$\text{Discount} = 0.4 \times 150 = 60$$

$$\text{Price after discount} = 150 - 60 = 90$$

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so the revenue from selling the unwanted CDs is:

$$\text{Revenue} = 5 \times 40 = 200$$

To find the amount James was out, we subtract the revenue from the price after discount:

$$\text{Amount out} = 90 - 200 = -110$$

The final answer is: $-110"
"To determine the total earnings from Jen's root crops, we need to calculate the revenue generated from each type of crop and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the yams: 6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.

Next, we'll calculate the revenue from the sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.

Lastly, we'll calculate the revenue from the carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.

Now, we'll sum the revenues from each type of root crop: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The total earnings from Jen's root crops are $34."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. Let's start by finding the time it took James to swim 60% of the 20-mile lake.

60% of 20 miles can be calculated as follows:

$$\frac{60}{100} \times 20 = 0.6 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}$$

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is:

$$t_1 = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}$$

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is:

$$t_2 = \frac{t_1}{2} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}$$

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

The time it took James to swim the remaining 8 miles is:

$$t_3 = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}$$

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

$$t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday and then subtract 40 from that result.

Let's denote the number of loaves Sam had last Friday as S. We are given that S = 70.

The number of loaves the bakery has is seven times S minus 40, which can be expressed as 7S - 40.

Substituting the value of S, we get 7(70) - 40.

Using the distributive property of multiplication, we can rewrite this as 7 * 70 - 40.

Multiplying 7 and 70, we get 490.

Now, we subtract 40 from 490: 490 - 40 = 450.

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final answer is: $\boxed{450}$"
"To determine the number of stickers Jasmine has at the end, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to account for the stickers she lost during playtime. Initially, Jasmine had 15 stickers. The loss of 7 stickers can be represented as:

15 - 7 = 8

This indicates that Jasmine has 8 stickers after losing 7. However, she received additional stickers for helping her classmates. This can be represented as:

8 + 5 = 13

Therefore, Jasmine has a total of 13 stickers at the end.

13"
"To determine the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

Let's start with the commission from the New York Times. The formula for commission is given by:

Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100

Given that the number of copies sold is 6, the price per copy is $5, and the commission rate is 10%, we can plug in these values into the formula:

Commission from New York Times = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
Commission from New York Times = 300 / 100
Commission from New York Times = $3

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal. The number of copies sold is 10, the price per copy is $15, and the commission rate is 8%. Using the same formula:

Commission from Wall Street Journal = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
Commission from Wall Street Journal = 1200 / 100
Commission from Wall Street Journal = $12

Now, we can find the total commission by adding the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal:

Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
Total commission = $3 + $12
Total commission = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Given the problem, we can establish a linear equation to represent the relationship between the ages of Marcus, Leo, and Deanna. Let's denote Leo's age as L, Marcus's age as M, and Deanna's age as D.

We are given that Deanna is 26 years old, so D = 26. We also know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, which can be expressed as M = D - 5. Substituting the value of D, we get M = 26 - 5 = 21.

Furthermore, we are told that Marcus is half of Leo's age, which can be represented as M = 0.5L. Substituting the value of M, we get 21 = 0.5L.

To find Leo's age, we can solve for L by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2, resulting in 2 * 21 = L, which simplifies to L = 42.

Therefore, the final answer is 42."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D.

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 

We can express these equations as:

B = A + 20  ... (Equation 1)
B = D + 10  ... (Equation 2)

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. 

Simplifying this equation, we get A - D = -10.

We also know that B + A + D = 45. 

Substituting B = A + 20 into this equation, we get (A + 20) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2A + D + 20 = 45.

Now, we can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45 to get (D + 10) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2D + A + 10 = 45.

We can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate A: (2A + D + 20) - (2D + A + 10) = 45 - 45.

This simplifies to A - D + 10 = 0.

We can rearrange the equation to get A - D = -10.

Now we can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10.

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation B = A + 20 to get B = (D - 10) + 20.

This simplifies to B = D + 10.

We can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B = A + 20 to get D + 10 = A + 20.

We can subtract 10 from both sides to get D = A + 10.

Now we have A = D - 10 and D = A + 10.

We can substitute D = A + 10 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = (A + 10) - 10.

This simplifies to A = A.

We can substitute D = A + 10 into the equation 2A + D + 20 = 45 to get 2(A + 10) + A + 20 = 45.

This simplifies to 3A + 30 = 45.

We can subtract 30 from both sides to get 3A = 15.

We can divide both sides by 3 to get A = 5.

Now that we know A = 5, we can substitute A = 5 into the equation B = A + 20 to get B = 5 + 20.

This simplifies to B = 25.

However, the question asks for the number of points Azibo scored, which is A.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Given that the book is printed on paper with 100 pages per inch and each page is printed on both sides, we can calculate the total number of pages per inch as follows:

Pages per inch = 100 pages/inch * 2 (since each page is printed on both sides)
Pages per inch = 200 pages/inch

Now, we are given that the book is 1.5 inches thick. To find the total number of pages in the book, we multiply the pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

Total pages = Pages per inch * Thickness of the book
Total pages = 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inch
Total pages = 300 pages

Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is 300.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. The time interval is from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a duration of 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

15 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:

900 ÷ 15 = 60

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 60 sets of 15 minutes, we can calculate the total number of reports stapled as follows:

30 reports/set × 60 sets = 1800 reports

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is 1800.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1800}$"
"To determine the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

First, let's find the total sleep time. Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can express this as 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her wake-up time is 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m. This means her sleep period is from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m.

To find the total sleep time, we can subtract the start time from the end time. The start time in minutes is 10 p.m. * 60 = 600 minutes, and the end time in minutes is 5:55 a.m. * 60 = 355 minutes. Therefore, the total sleep time is 355 - 600 = -245 minutes. However, this is incorrect since we cannot have a negative number of minutes. We need to recalculate the total sleep time.

The correct way to find the total sleep time is to calculate the difference between the end and start times in minutes, taking into account the 24-hour clock. The start time is 10 p.m. (600 minutes) and the end time is 5:55 a.m. (355 minutes). The correct calculation is 355 - 600 = -245 minutes, but this is incorrect. We need to add 24 hours to the end time to get the correct result. 24 hours * 60 minutes = 1440 minutes. So, the correct calculation is 355 + 1440 = 1795 minutes. Then, we subtract the start time: 1795 - 600 = 1195 minutes.

However, this is still not the correct total sleep time. We need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time: 1195 - 23 = 1172 minutes.

The final answer is: 1172"
"To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we first need to establish the initial quantities of measuring cups and spoons. Given that Jonathan has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of cups as follows:

2 dozen = 2 × 12 = 24 cups

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can express this relationship as a ratio. To find the number of spoons, we multiply the number of cups by 2/3:

24 cups × (2/3) = 16 spoons

Now, we need to account for the 6 measuring spoons Jonathan gifted to Pedro. To find the remaining number of spoons, we subtract 6 from the initial number of spoons:

16 spoons - 6 spoons = 10 spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining spoons and the number of cups:

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

The final numerical answer is: 34"
"To determine the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the initial number of occupied beds. Given that 1/5 of the hospital's 1000 beds are occupied, we can express this as a fraction:

$$\frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200$$

Since 1/5 of the beds are occupied, 4/5 of the beds are unoccupied. We can calculate this as:

$$\frac{4}{5} \times 1000 = 800$$

Next, we need to calculate the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks, considering that 50 patients are admitted each day. With 14 days in 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted is:

$$50 \times 14 = 700$$

Adding the initial number of occupied beds to the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks gives us the total number of occupied beds:

$$200 + 700 = 900$$

Finally, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds:

$$1000 - 900 = 100$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total number of non-work emails. Since Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work-related, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Now, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are sent to family. Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family, which can be calculated as (2/3) * 9 = 6.

The remaining non-work emails (not to family) are 9 - 6 = 3. Since one-third of these emails are to her boyfriend, we can calculate this as (1/3) * 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a series of equations to solve for Shawna's father's age.

Let's denote Shawna's age as S, Aliya's age as A, and Shawna's father's age as F.

From the information provided, we have the following equations:

1. F = 5S (Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna)
2. S = 3A (Shawna is three times as old as Aliya)
3. A = 3 (Aliya is 3 years old)

Substituting equation (3) into equation (2), we get:
S = 3 * 3
S = 9

Now, substitute S = 9 into equation (1):
F = 5 * 9
F = 45

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported by Courtney and subtract it from the number reported by Courtney.

Let's denote the number reported by Courtney as x. We know that Kelly stated Courtney overstated the number by 20%, which means the actual number is 80% of the number reported by Courtney. We can express this as 0.8x.

We are given that the number reported by Courtney is 48. So, we can set up the equation:

0.8x = 48

To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to solve for x. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.8:

x = 48 / 0.8
x = 60

However, this is the number reported by Courtney, which is 20% more than the actual number. To find the actual number, we need to subtract 20% of 48 from 48. We can express this as:

Actual number = 48 - (0.20 * 48)
Actual number = 48 - 9.6
Actual number = 38.4

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{38.4}$"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a relationship between the number of balls carried by each individual. Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls. Similarly, Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 * 2x = 4x balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them, which can be expressed as x + 2x + 4x = 7x.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls. Since Jason carried 2x balls, we can set up the equation 2x = 2 and solve for x.

2x = 2
x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the total number of balls by substituting x into the equation 7x.

Total number of balls = 7x
Total number of balls = 7 * 1
Total number of balls = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of holes dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure. Let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of holes dug on the fourth day as x. We know that the total number of holes at the end of the first day is 10. By the end of the second day, the total number of holes is 10 + 13 = 23. After digging 8 holes and filling in 2 on the third day, the total number of holes becomes 23 + 8 - 2 = 29.

We are given that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Therefore, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since we know the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day, we can set up an equation to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day:

29 + x = 40

Subtracting 29 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 40 - 29
x = 11

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is 11.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"Given that Amora and Lainey received an equal number of corn chips, and Collins received 15 more than each of them, we can denote the number of corn chips Amora and Lainey received as x. Therefore, Collins received x + 15 corn chips.

Since we know that Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, we can set up the equation:

x = 70

To find the total number of corn chips, we need to sum the number of corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins. Since Collins received 15 more than each of them, we can express the total as:

Total = x + x + (x + 15)
Total = 3x + 15

Substituting the value of x, we get:

Total = 3(70) + 15
Total = 210 + 15
Total = 225

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is 225.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To determine the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. This can be expressed as a mathematical equation:

Let S be the cost of supplies and T be the cost of travel. We are given that S = $400. The cost of travel is 50% more than the cost of supplies, which can be written as:

T = S + 0.5S
T = 1.5S

Substituting the value of S, we get:

T = 1.5 * $400
T = $600

Therefore, the cost of travel is $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L.

We have the following system of equations:

1. A + S + L = 339
2. L = S + 5
3. S = 4A - 13

We can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to get:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
A + 2S + 5 = 339

Now, substitute equation (3) into the previous equation:
A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S by substituting A into equation (3):
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a direct relationship between the number of episodes and the total time spent watching the show. Let's denote the number of episodes as 'e' and the length of each episode as 'l'. We are given that the length of each episode is 20 minutes, so l = 20.

We are also given that the number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. This can be expressed as e = l/2. Substituting the value of l, we get e = 20/2 = 10.

To find the total time spent watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: Total Time = e * l = 10 * 20 = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we can break down the bird's journey into three segments and calculate the net displacement.

The bird travels south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour, resulting in a displacement of $d_1 = 30 \cdot 10 = 300$ miles. Then, the bird travels north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour, resulting in a displacement of $d_2 = 18 \cdot 2 = 36$ miles. Finally, the bird travels south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour, resulting in a displacement of $d_3 = 22 \cdot 5 = 110$ miles.

The net displacement, which represents the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, is the sum of the displacements in the southerly direction minus the displacement in the northerly direction: $d_{net} = d_1 + d_3 - d_2 = 300 + 110 - 36 = 374$ miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta received. We can start by converting the mixed numbers to a common unit for easier calculation.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is equivalent to 12 brownies.
She received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, which is equivalent to 6 brownies.
She received 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is equivalent to 48 brownies.

Now, let's add the total number of brownies received:
12 + 6 + 48 = 66

Next, we need to calculate the number of brownies eaten. We are given that 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. To convert this to a numerical value, we multiply 1.5 by 12:
1.5 × 12 = 18

Now, we can find the total number of brownies left over by subtracting the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received:
66 - 18 = 48

Therefore, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to determine the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age can be expressed as 2x, where x is Nani's age. Given that Nani is 8 years old, his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we can express this as 0.75x, where x is Nani's age. Therefore, Nani's sister's age is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

Let's denote the time for synthetic gut racquets as SG, polyester string racquets as PS, and hybrid racquets as H. We have 3 synthetic gut racquets, 5 polyester string racquets, and 4 hybrid racquets.

The time for synthetic gut racquets is given by SG = 3 * 15 minutes = 45 minutes.
The time for polyester string racquets is given by PS = 5 * 22 minutes = 110 minutes.
The time for hybrid racquets is given by H = 4 * 18 minutes = 72 minutes.

The total time is the sum of these three times: T = SG + PS + H = 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

The final answer is: 227"
"To determine the total cost of the phones, we need to consider the pricing structure. The first two phones are priced at $600 each, while the remaining two phones are half the price of the initial ones.

Let's denote the price of the first two phones as P1 and the price of the remaining two phones as P2. We know that P1 = $600 and P2 = P1 / 2 = $300.

The total cost of the first two phones is 2 * P1 = 2 * $600 = $1200.

The total cost of the remaining two phones is 2 * P2 = 2 * $300 = $600.

To find the total cost of all four phones, we add the cost of the first two phones to the cost of the remaining two phones: Total Cost = $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To determine the total number of players in both teams, we need to calculate the number of players in Zeke's team and add it to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Let's denote the number of players in Carlton's team as C. We are given that C = 13.

We are also given that Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. Therefore, the number of players in Zeke's team can be expressed as C + 7.

Substituting the value of C, we get the number of players in Zeke's team as 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players in Carlton's team and Zeke's team: C + (C + 7) = 13 + 20 = 33.

The final answer is: 33"
"To determine the total number of wooden slats needed for the fence, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

P = 2(length + width)

Given the length of the garden is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(15 + 10)
P = 2(25)
P = 50 feet

Since Robert requires 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to find the total number of slats needed:

Total slats needed = 2P
Total slats needed = 2(50)
Total slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we calculate the total number of oranges she had initially. Since she bought 12 boxes, each containing 20 oranges, the total number of oranges is given by the product of the number of boxes and the number of oranges per box: $12 \times 20 = 240$ oranges.

Next, we need to find out how many oranges she gave away to her mom and sister. Since she gave each of them 2 boxes, the total number of boxes given away is $2 + 2 = 4$. The total number of oranges given away is then $4 \times 20 = 80$ oranges.

Now, we need to find out how many oranges she had left after giving some away. This is given by the difference between the initial number of oranges and the number of oranges given away: $240 - 80 = 160$ oranges.

Since she kept $\frac{1}{4}$ of the oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges she kept by multiplying the remaining number of oranges by $\frac{1}{4}$: $\frac{1}{4} \times 160 = 40$ oranges.

Finally, to find the number of oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges she had left: $160 - 40 = 120$ oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find the total number of states in both the USA and India, we need to determine the number of states in each country. 

The USA has 50 states. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. To find half of 50, we divide 50 by 2, which is 25. Then, we add 4 to 25, resulting in 29 states in India.

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India: 50 + 29 = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"To determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to purchase.

The total cost of the books is given by the sum of their individual costs: $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to find the remaining amount he must earn to afford the books. This can be calculated as the difference between the total cost and the amount saved: $39 - $14 = $25.

Now, we can determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the remaining amount he must earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5). This is a straightforward application of the division operation:

$$\frac{\text{Amount to earn}}{\text{Hourly wage}} = \frac{\$25}{\$5} = 5$$

Therefore, Tyler needs to work for 5 hours to afford his books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Given that Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can determine Richard's share by subtracting 10 from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

Now, to find the number of cherries Jerry has, we need to subtract the combined total of Robert and Richard's cherries from the total number of cherries: 60 - (30 + 20) = 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

To find the difference in the number of cherries between Robert and Jerry, we subtract Jerry's total from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total earnings for the two-day fundraiser, we need to calculate the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

We are given that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.

We also know that on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Therefore, A = Sunday's apple pie - 4.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so Sunday's gingerbread = G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

We are also given that on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, we can find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday. 
A = Sunday's apple pie - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

Total earnings on Saturday = (G * 6) + (A * 15) = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225.

Total earnings on Sunday = (Sunday's gingerbread * 6) + (Sunday's apple pie * 15) = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315.

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday = 225 + 315 = 540.

The final answer is: $\boxed{540}$"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need, we must calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use during her 8-day vacation.

Given that she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. Over the course of 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day for 8 days, which is 4 * 8 = 32 times.

Since each application requires 1 ounce of sunscreen, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is 32 ounces.

To find the number of bottles needed, we divide the total amount of sunscreen used (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 ÷ 8 = 4

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Given that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, and the price of the blue car is $100, we can calculate the price of the red car by finding 40% of the price of the blue car and subtracting it from the price of the blue car.

To find 40% of the price of the blue car, we multiply the price by 0.4:

0.4 × $100 = $40

Now, we subtract this amount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:

$100 - $40 = $60

Therefore, the price of the red car is $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we add the prices of the blue and red cars:

$100 + $60 = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's analyze the given information:

Let E be Emil's current age, D be his dad's current age, and B be his brother's current age.

We are given the following information:

1. E = 19 (Emil's current age)
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad: 24 = 0.5D
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother: 24 = 2B

From equation (3), we can deduce that B = 24 / 2 = 12.

From equation (2), we can express D in terms of E: D = 24 * 2 = 48. However, since we need to find D in terms of E, we can rewrite equation (2) as 24 = 0.5D, which implies D = 24 * 2 = 48. Since Emil is 19 now, we can find D by adding 5 to 19 (the number of years until Emil turns 24) to D's expression in terms of E: D = 48 - 5 = 43.

Now, we can find B by subtracting 5 from 12 (the number of years until Emil turns 24): B = 12 - 5 = 7.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is D + B = 43 + 7 = 50.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads given by her mother, sister, and friend, and then sum them up.

Let's denote the number of beads given by her mother as M. We know that her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so the number of beads given by her sister is M + 10. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so the number of beads given by her friend is 2M.

We are given that her mother gave her 20 beads, so M = 20. Therefore, the number of beads given by her sister is 20 + 10 = 30, and the number of beads given by her friend is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, let's add the beads together: M + (M + 10) + 2M = 20 + 30 + 40 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

Let's denote the amount of crawfish Joe caught on Thursday as $T$, Friday as $F$, and Saturday as $S$. We are given that $T = 3$ pounds.

On Friday, Joe caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is $F = 4T = 4(3) = 12$ pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is $S = \frac{1}{2}F = \frac{1}{2}(12) = 6$ pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: $T + F + S = 3 + 12 + 6 = 21$ pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: $\frac{21}{3} = 7$.

Therefore, the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has is 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we first need to find the number of football players, which is 20% of the total class size of 30 students.

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

The remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Next, we need to find the number of cheerleaders or band members, which is 25% of the remaining 24 students.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders or band members.

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To find the average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie, we need to calculate the arithmetic mean of their shoe sizes. 

Let's denote Sophie's shoe size as S = 5. Since Charlie's shoe size is five times that of Sophie's, we can express it as C = 5S = 5 * 5 = 25.

The average shoe size (A) is the sum of their shoe sizes divided by 2. Therefore, A = (S + C) / 2 = (5 + 25) / 2.

To calculate the average, we first find the sum of their shoe sizes: 5 + 25 = 30. Then, we divide this sum by 2: 30 / 2 = 15.

The average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Let's denote the number of plants as 'n'. The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is 1332 - 18n - 12n = 1320 - 30n.

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 'n - 17' more flowers. The total cost of the flowers will be the number of flowers she needs to buy multiplied by the cost of each flower, which is (n - 17) * 6.

We know that the total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is equal to the width of the plant (12 inches) multiplied by the number of plants (n). So, we can set up the equation: 12n = 1320 - 30n.

To solve for 'n', we can add 30n to both sides of the equation: 42n = 1320. Then, we can divide both sides by 42: n = 1320 / 42 = 31.4286. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 31 plants.

Now that we know Pat needs 31 - 17 = 14 more flowers, we can calculate the total cost: 14 * 6 = 84.

The final answer is: $84"
"To determine the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to calculate his daily consumption. Since he eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, who consumes 18 pretzels per day, we can express this as a fraction:

Edgar's brother's daily consumption = 1/2 * 18

Using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can rewrite this as:

Edgar's brother's daily consumption = (1/2) * 18
= (1 * 18) / 2
= 18 / 2
= 9

Now, to find the total number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7:

Edgar's brother's weekly consumption = 9 * 7
= 63

The final answer is: 63"
"To determine the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

Let's denote the number of baskets as B, the number of petunias per basket as P, the number of sweet potato vines per basket as V, the cost of a petunia as C_p, and the cost of a sweet potato vine as C_v.

Given values:
- B = 5
- P = 3
- V = 2
- C_p = $3.00
- C_v = $2.50

Cost of petunias: B * P * C_p = 5 * 3 * $3.00 = $45.00
Cost of sweet potato vines: B * V * C_v = 5 * 2 * $2.50 = $25.00

Total cost = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To determine the number of roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Let's denote the number of sunflowers as S, the number of carnations as C, and the number of roses as R. We are given that S = 4 and C = 10.

The amount of soil required for sunflowers is 3S pounds, and for carnations is 1.5C pounds. We are also given that the total amount of soil available is 30 pounds.

We can set up the equation to represent the total amount of soil used:

3S + 1.5C = 30

Substituting the given values for S and C, we get:

3(4) + 1.5(10) = 30

Expanding the equation, we get:

12 + 15 = 30

Simplifying the equation, we get:

27 = 30

However, this is not possible since the total amount of soil used (27 pounds) exceeds the available soil (30 pounds). This indicates that we cannot plant the given number of sunflowers and carnations.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations is 27 pounds. We can set up an inequality to represent the situation:

3S + 1.5C ≤ 30

Substituting the given values for S and C, we get:

3(4) + 1.5(10) ≤ 30

Expanding the equation, we get:

12 + 15 ≤ 30

Simplifying the equation, we get:

27 ≤ 30

This inequality is true, indicating that we can plant the given number of sunflowers and carnations.

Now, let's find the amount of soil left for roses:

30 - 27 = 3

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses that can be planted is:

R = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of pairs of shoes Jessica can purchase in a year, we first need to calculate her monthly savings. Given that she sets aside 25% of her monthly income, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 25 by 100:

25 ÷ 100 = 0.25

Now, we multiply this decimal by her monthly income of $2,000.00 to find her monthly savings:

0.25 × $2,000.00 = $500.00

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find her annual savings by multiplying her monthly savings by 12:

$500.00 × 12 = $6,000.00

Next, we divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes, which is $1,000.00, to determine the number of pairs she can purchase in a year:

$6,000.00 ÷ $1,000.00 = 6

Therefore, Jessica can purchase 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both tasks simultaneously. 

Let's analyze the peeling task first. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we can use the formula:

Time = Total Shrimp / Shrimp per Minute
Time = 90 / 6
Time = 15 minutes

Next, let's analyze the cooking task. Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we can use the same approach:

Time = Total Shrimp / Shrimp per 10 minutes
Time = 90 / 30
Time = 3 * 10 minutes
Time = 30 minutes

Since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we need to find the maximum time between the two tasks. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The maximum time is 30 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 30 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

Let's denote the initial temperature as T. The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. The total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees. 

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. The total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees when the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to establish the relationship between the comet's orbital period and the ages of Bill and his father.

Let's denote the time elapsed between Bill's birth and his father's sighting of the comet as x. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's father saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time.

Given that Bill was three times his father's age when he saw the comet for the second time, we can express this as 3(30) = 90 years old. This implies that the time elapsed between Bill's birth and his father's sighting of the comet is 75 years.

We can now set up an equation to find Bill's age when his father saw the comet: x + 30 = 90, where x is the time elapsed between Bill's birth and his father's sighting of the comet.

Solving for x, we get x = 60. This means that Bill's father was 60 years old when Bill was born.

Since Bill was 30 years old when his father saw the comet, we can find Bill's age when his father was born by subtracting 60 from 30, which gives us 30 - 60 = -30. However, this is not possible since age cannot be negative. This indicates that the initial assumption of 3(30) = 90 is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age, then Bill's age at the second sighting is 3y, where y is his father's age at the first sighting. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years.

We can set up the equation 3y + 75 = 90 to find Bill's father's age at the first sighting. Solving for y, we get y = 5.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's father saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time. This means that Bill's father was 5 years old when Bill was born.

Since Bill was 30 years old when his father saw the comet, we can find Bill's age when his father was born by subtracting 5 from 30, which gives us 30 - 5 = 25.

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, not when his father was born.

Let's re-evaluate the problem again. If Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age, then Bill's age at the second sighting is 3y, where y is his father's age at the first sighting.

Let's denote the time elapsed between Bill's birth and his father's sighting of the comet as x. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's father saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time.

Given that Bill was three times his father's age when he saw the comet for the second time, we can express this as 3(30) = 90 years old. However, this is not the correct approach.

Let's re-evaluate the problem again. If Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age, then Bill's age at the second sighting is 3y, where y is his father's age at the first sighting.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and add them together.

First, let's consider the frequency of each type of check:

- Electric bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
- Gas bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
- Church: 2 checks per month, so 24 checks per year.
- Pest and lawn service: 1 check every 3 months, so 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks:
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The total number of checks Buford writes per year is 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Given the problem, we can break it down as follows:

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, we can express this relationship as:

x / 2 = 44

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

x = 88

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is (3/4)x = (3/4)(88) = 66.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2)(x - 66) = (1/2)(88 - 66) = (1/2)(22) = 11.

Therefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and add them together.

Let's denote the howling time of Tobias as T, Chikote as C, and Igneous as I. We are given that T = 20 seconds.

Since Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, we can express this as C = 2T. Substituting the value of T, we get C = 2(20) = 40 seconds.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so I = T + C. Substituting the values of T and C, we get I = 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the individual howling times together: T + C + I = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 

$$\frac{120}{60} = 2$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Let's denote the amount Adam's mother gave him as M and the amount his father gave him as F. We know that F = 2M.

Given that Adam's mother gave him $6, we can write M = $6.

Since F = 2M, we can substitute the value of M to find F: F = 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is the sum of M and F, which is $6 + $12 = $18.

Now, we can find the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings by subtracting the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"Given the problem, we can approach it by first expressing the total age of the children as the sum of their individual ages. Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. We know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, and we are given that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group.

The total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:

3 + 4 + Helene's age + W = 20

We also know that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. Therefore, the average age is 20/4 = 5.

Since Helene's age is twice the average age, we can express Helene's age as 2 * 5 = 10.

Now we can substitute Helene's age in the first equation:

3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants:

17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:

W = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Let's denote the amount collected from the neighbors as N and the amount collected from the online fund as O. We are given that N = $500 and O = $1500.

The total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund is the sum of N and O:

N + O = $500 + $1500 = $2000

However, we are told that Walter's friend donates $200, but this amount is not included in the calculation for the lawyer's contribution. Therefore, we only consider the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000.

The lawyer will donate three times this amount, which is 3 × (N + O) = 3 × $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"Given that each guest at the wedding reception brought a plate of 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, we can calculate the total number of cookies as follows:

Total number of cookies = Number of guests * Number of cookies per guest
= 100 * 15
= 1500

Since the bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door, we can find the number of cookies given to the church by multiplying the total number of cookies by 1/2:

Number of cookies given to the church = Total number of cookies * 1/2
= 1500 * 1/2
= 750

Now, we know that each person in the church received 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies per person:

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"Given a family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) dividing a watermelon such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can approach this problem by assuming the total watermelon is a unit of measurement, such as 100 units.

Let's denote the amount of watermelon each kid gets as x. Since each adult receives twice as much as each kid, each adult gets 2x units.

The total amount of watermelon given to the kids is 4x (4 kids * x units each). The total amount given to the adults is 2x (2 adults * 2x units each).

Since the total watermelon is 100 units, we can set up the equation: 4x + 2x = 100.

Combining like terms, we get 6x = 100.

Dividing both sides by 6, we find x = 100/6 = 16.67.

Now that we know each kid gets 16.67 units, each adult gets 2x = 2 * 16.67 = 33.33 units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (33.33 / 100) * 100 = 33.33%.

Therefore, each adult gets 33.33% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{33.33}$"
"To determine the time Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from his total work hours.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds. Since Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients and each round takes 20 minutes, we can express this as a simple multiplication problem:

9 inpatients × 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes

Next, we calculate the time spent on appointments. With 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes, we have:

10 appointments × 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes

Now, we add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

180 minutes (rounds) + 300 minutes (appointments) = 480 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

480 minutes ÷ 60 = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours:

9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Therefore, Doctor Jones has 1 hour left to update his records.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete the process. 

The time to make the cake batter is 20 minutes, the time to bake the cake is 30 minutes, the time to cool the cake is 2 hours (which is equivalent to 120 minutes), and the time to frost the cake is 10 minutes.

Total time required = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

To convert the total time to hours, we divide by 60:
\[ \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time required from the desired serving time to find the latest start time. 

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake at 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

Let's denote the cost of renting the studio per session as $C_r = 25 and the cost per student per session as $C_s = 1.50. The number of students is given as n = 10, and the studio is rented 3 days a week. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the number of sessions in a month is s = 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The total cost per session is the sum of the cost of renting the studio and the cost of students, which is C_total = C_r + n * C_s = 25 + 10 * 1.50 = 25 + 15 = 40 dollars.

To find the total earnings per month, we multiply the total cost per session by the number of sessions in a month: Earnings = C_total * s = 40 * 12 = 480 dollars.

The final answer is: $480"
"Given that Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, we can set up the following equations to find the number of chocolate bars in each box.

Let x be the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha.

For Peter: 4x = 64
For Martha: 7x = 56

To find the value of x, we can solve these equations by dividing both sides by the number of boxes.

For Peter: x = 64 / 4
x = 16

For Martha: x = 56 / 7
x = 8

Now, we can find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"Given the population of porcupines in a park is 50, we can determine the number of female porcupines by multiplying the total population by 3/5.

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

To find the total number of porcupines after a year, we add the initial population and the number of babies born.

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 48 = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To determine the cost of filling the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. Given the dimensions of the pool are 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

V = lwh

where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth in this case).

V = 14 * 25 * 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

However, the pool company requires us to multiply the volume by 5.9 to obtain the number of gallons of water needed. This is likely due to the fact that 1 cubic foot of water is approximately equal to 7.48 gallons. Therefore, we can calculate the number of gallons as follows:

Gallons = V * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons ≈ 8260 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost to fill the pool by multiplying the number of gallons by the cost per gallon, which is $0.10.

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = $826

The final answer is: $826"
"To determine the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of blue and yellow sticks based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of red sticks as R, blue sticks as B, and yellow sticks as Y. We are given that R = 9 and B = R + 5. 

We can express the number of blue sticks as B = 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so Y = B - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: R + B + Y = 9 + 14 + 11.

9 + 14 + 11 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the difference in distance traveled by Matteo and Shandy, we need to calculate their individual distances and then find the difference between them.

First, we'll calculate the distance traveled by each individual using the formula: distance = speed × time.

For Matteo: distance = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy: distance = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we'll find the difference in their distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo.

Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{230}$"
"To determine the number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old, which is 3000 / 2 = 1500 students. Since one-fourth of the students over 16 are male, the number of male students over 16 is 1500 / 4 = 375. Therefore, the number of female students over 16 is 1500 - 375 = 1125.

Next, we find the number of students under 16, which is also half of the total students, or 3000 / 2 = 1500. Since one-half of the students under 16 are male, the number of male students under 16 is 1500 / 2 = 750. Consequently, the number of female students under 16 is 1500 - 750 = 750.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of laps Bethany and Quinn can run, we need to analyze the given information step by step.

Let's denote the number of laps Bethany can run as B, Trey as T, Shaelyn as S, and Quinn as Q.

From the problem statement, we have the following relationships:

1. B = 10 (Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour)
2. T = B + 4 (Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany)
3. S = T / 2 (Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey)
4. Q = S - 2 (Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn)

Now, let's substitute the values step by step:

1. T = B + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14
2. S = T / 2 = 14 / 2 = 7
3. Q = S - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of laps Bethany and Quinn can run. This can be calculated as B - Q.

B - Q = 10 - 5 = 5

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

Let's break down the problem step by step. On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is $\frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500$ gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped $\frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375$ gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is $\frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000$ gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is $\frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125$ gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is $4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000$ gallons.

The amount of water remaining in the tank is $18000 - 12000 = 6000$ gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation to model the situation. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%.

However, we are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the 34% remaining after 8 hours is reduced to 28% after the last 3 hours. To find the charge remaining after 8 hours, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the charge remaining after 8 hours is y. Then, the charge lost in the last 3 hours is y - 28%. We know that the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 34% - 28% = 6%.

So, we can set up the equation: y - 28% = 6%.

Solving for y, we get y = 34%.

Now, we know that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34%. We also know that the charge remaining after 5 hours is 55%. To find the initial charge, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the first 5 hours.

The charge lost in the first 5 hours is 55% - 34% = 21%.

So, we can set up the equation: x - 21% = 55%.

Solving for x, we get x = 76%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 76%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{76}$"
"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first calculate her total weekly earnings. Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15, resulting in a total hourly earnings of $25.

Given that she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:

Weekly Earnings = Hourly Earnings × Number of Hours Worked
= $25/hour × 40 hours/week
= $1000/week

Next, we need to find the amount Janet needs to save for the down payment, which is 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. This can be calculated as:

Down Payment = 20% × $10,000
= 0.20 × $10,000
= $2,000

Now, we can determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment by dividing the amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

Number of Weeks = Down Payment / Weekly Earnings
= $2,000 / $1,000
= 2

Therefore, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of plums Jamaar can purchase, we need to calculate the remaining funds after accounting for the cost of the fruits he has already bought.

Let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 × $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 × $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 × $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 × $0.75 = $3.75

The total cost of the fruits he has already purchased is $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25.

Jamaar started with $10, so we subtract the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased from his initial amount to find the remaining funds:

$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Now, we need to determine how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75. Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find the number of plums he can purchase:

$\frac{0.75}{0.25} = 3$

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to calculate the total number of packs given away by Anne. Since she kept 2 packs out of 15, the number of packs given away is 15 - 2 = 13.

Now, we divide the total number of packs given away by the number of friends to find out how many packs each friend received. This is a simple division problem:

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, we can multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces per pack to find the total number of pieces each friend received:

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces

Therefore, each friend received 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the future value of an investment with a fixed annual increase rate. In this case, the price of carrots is increasing by 5% every year. To solve this problem, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where:
- A is the future value of the investment (price of carrots after n years)
- P is the principal (initial price of carrots) = $120
- r is the annual increase rate (5% in this case) = 0.05
- n is the number of years = 3

Plugging in the values, we get:

A = 120(1 + 0.05)^3
A = 120(1.05)^3
A = 120 * 1.157625
A ≈ 139.32

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies, we can start by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums to find the number of pictures in each album.

Let's denote the number of pictures in each album as x. Since Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can set up the equation:

72 = 8x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 8:

x = 72 / 8
x = 9

Now that we know the number of pictures in each album, we can find the number of selfies and portraits. Since 3 albums were selfies only, the number of selfies is 3x = 3(9) = 27.

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 - 3 - 2 = 3 albums. 
The number of portraits is 3x = 3(9) = 27.

Therefore, the total number of portraits and selfies is 27 selfies + 27 portraits = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine the time James spends reading, we need to calculate the number of sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

Let's denote the number of pages James reads as P and the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages as t. We know that P = 18 and t = 10 minutes.

Since James reads 3 pages per set, we can find the number of sets by dividing the total number of pages by 3: P / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6 sets.

Now, we can find the total time James spends reading by multiplying the number of sets by the time per set: 6 sets * t = 6 * 10 minutes = 60 minutes.

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the net change in the number of guests.

Initially, there were 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, resulting in a decrease of 24 guests. The number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, which is a decrease of 15 guests. The number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30. This is an increase of 30 guests. The number of guests remaining is 61 + 30 = 91.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, resulting in an increase of 7 guests. The total number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the total number of bananas John has, we need to calculate the bananas he picked on each day and then sum them up.

Let's denote the number of bananas John picked on Wednesday as W, on Thursday as T, and on Friday as F. We know that W = 4, T = 6, and F = 3W.

We can substitute the value of W into the expression for F: F = 3(4) = 12.

Now, we can add the bananas he picked on each day: W + T + F = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22.

Therefore, the total number of bananas John has is 22."
"To determine the number of points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, and then find out how many of each she is sure to get.

First, let's find out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are in the quiz:
- Total questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24
- Average and difficult questions: 60 - 24 = 36
- Average questions: 36 / 2 = 18
- Difficult questions: 36 / 2 = 18

Now, let's find out how many of each type of question Aries is sure to get:
- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9
- Difficult questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9

Now, let's add up the number of questions Aries is sure to get:
18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'.

We know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, so the price of a large stuffed animal is $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation: 4x + 12y = 120.

We also know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write another equation: x = 2y.

Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since x = 2y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches the family consumes in one week, we need to calculate the daily consumption and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

Let's denote the number of sandwiches the man eats per day as M, the number of sandwiches the wife eats per day as W, and the number of sandwiches the son eats per day as S. Given that M = 5, W = 4, and S = 2, we can calculate the total daily consumption as:

Total daily consumption = M + W + S
Total daily consumption = 5 + 4 + 2
Total daily consumption = 11

Now, to find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we multiply the total daily consumption by the number of days in a week (7):

Total weekly consumption = Total daily consumption * 7
Total weekly consumption = 11 * 7
Total weekly consumption = 77

Therefore, the family consumes 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To determine Suzanne's remaining earnings, we need to calculate her total revenue and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate her revenue from selling cookies:
80 cookies * $1 each = $80

Next, let's calculate her revenue from selling cupcakes:
60 cupcakes * $4 each = $240

Now, let's add her revenue from cookies and cupcakes:
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave a total of:
2 * $10 = $20

Now, let's subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total revenue:
$320 - $20 = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of eggs found by the friends, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

Let's denote the total number of eggs as T, the number of eggs found by the Smith twins as S, and the number of eggs remaining unfound as U. We are given that T = 100, S = 30 * 2 = 60, and U = 10.

The number of eggs found by the friends can be calculated as T - (S + U). 

T - (S + U) = 100 - (60 + 10)
= 100 - 70
= 30

Therefore, the number of eggs found by the friends is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days, we need to calculate the daily ore production per dwarf and then scale it up to the total number of dwarves and days.

First, let's establish the daily ore production per dwarf with a steel pickaxe. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pounds per day. 

Now, to find the daily ore production with a steel pickaxe, we need to calculate 50% more than the iron pickaxe production. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. Therefore, the daily ore production with a steel pickaxe is 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Given that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, we can calculate the total daily production for 40 dwarves: 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds per day.

To find the total ore production for 30 days, we multiply the daily production by the number of days: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43200}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a proportionality relationship between the number of sandwiches and their respective prices. Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as x.

We have two known ratios: 3/2 and 6/4. To simplify these ratios, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator of each fraction by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. This yields 3/2 and 3/2.

Since the ratios are equivalent, we can set up a proportion to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches. The proportion is (3/2) = (6/4) = (x/8).

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 3 * 8 = 2 * x, which simplifies to 24 = 2x.

Now, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate x: x = 24/2 = 12.

Therefore, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the monthly payment for the bedroom set, we need to calculate the remaining balance after Tom pays $1000 from the sale of his old bedroom set.

The initial cost of the bedroom set is $3000. After paying $1000, the remaining balance is:

$3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, we need to calculate the monthly payment, which is 10% of the remaining balance. To find 10% of a number, we multiply it by 0.10.

Monthly payment = $2000 × 0.10
Monthly payment = $200

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.

The final answer is: $200"
"To determine the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.

1. 40% of the red balloons burst:
   Number of red balloons that burst = 0.4 * 25 = 10
   Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15

2. Half of the yellow balloons were released:
   Number of yellow balloons released = 1/2 * 12 = 6
   Number of yellow balloons remaining = 12 - 6 = 6

3. 75% of the blue balloons were added:
   Number of blue balloons added = 0.75 * 8 = 6
   Total number of balloons now = 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 34

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance of convincing the teacher, and 60% chance of the teacher not giving an extension). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability of having to turn in his homework.

Let's calculate the total probability of not having to turn in his homework: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. Since 102% is not a valid probability, we need to convert it to a decimal: 102% = 1.02. Now, we can subtract 1.02 from 1 to get the probability of having to turn in his homework: 1 - 1.02 = -0.02. However, this is not a valid probability since probabilities cannot be negative.

"To determine the number of tickets each graduate can receive, we need to calculate the available seating in the Fine Arts Center after accounting for the reserved seats.

Let's denote the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center as C, the number of reserved seats for graduates and faculty as R, and the number of tickets each graduate can receive as T.

Given:
C = 6000 (total capacity)
R = 950 (reserved seats for graduates and faculty)

Available seats = C - R
Available seats = 6000 - 950
Available seats = 5050

Now, we can calculate the number of tickets each graduate can receive by dividing the available seats by the number of graduates.

Number of graduates = R = 950
Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5050 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5.32

Since we cannot distribute a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, the remaining tickets are for guests, implying that each graduate can give out the calculated number of tickets to their friends and family.

Therefore, the number of tickets each graduate can receive is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the equivalent number of small beans for the given quantities of large and medium-sized beans.

Let's start by defining the relationships between the different sizes of jelly beans. We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is 2 * 75 = 150.

Now, we need to find the equivalent number of small beans for 150 medium-sized beans. We are given that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. This can be represented as a ratio: 3 small beans = 1 medium bean.

To find the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we can set up a proportion: 3 small beans / 1 medium bean = x small beans / 150 medium beans. Solving for x, we get x = (3 * 150) / 1 = 450.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

The final answer is: $\boxed{450}$"
"To determine Melissa's hourly pay after expenses, we need to calculate her net earnings and then divide that by the total number of hours she worked.

First, let's calculate her total earnings: 3 days * $15 per day = $45. 

Next, we need to calculate her total expenses: 3 days * $3 per day = $9.

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: 
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Since Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, we need to find the total number of hours she worked:
Total hours = 6 hours/day * 3 days
Total hours = 18 hours

Now, let's calculate her hourly pay after expenses:
Hourly pay after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours
Hourly pay after expenses = $36 / 18
Hourly pay after expenses = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the total amount spent, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the cost of the books: 3 books at $16 each is equivalent to 3 × 16 = $48.

Next, we calculate the cost of the pencils: 3 pencils at $6 each is equivalent to 3 × 6 = $18.

Now, we add the cost of the books and the pencils to find the total amount spent: $48 + $18 = $66.

The final answer is: $66"
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of intervals between the bottles and multiply it by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

Given that the driveway is 24 feet wide and Richard wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can find the total number of intervals by dividing the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

$$\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet}} = 8$$

Since there are 8 intervals, and it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can find the total time by multiplying the number of intervals by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:

$$8 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of packs Uncle Franky can make, we need to calculate the total number of apples he has and then divide that by the number of apples in each pack.

Given that each box contains 40 apples and Uncle Franky ordered two boxes, we can calculate the total number of apples as follows:

Total apples = Number of boxes × Apples per box
Total apples = 2 × 40
Total apples = 80

Now, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples, where each pack contains 8 apples. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack:

Number of packs = Total apples ÷ Apples per pack
Number of packs = 80 ÷ 8
Number of packs = 10

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

"To determine the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she purchased and subtract it from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 × $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 × $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Given that Amor starts with $50, we can calculate the remaining amount of money she has by subtracting the total cost of the cheese from the initial amount: $50 - $40 = $10.

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

The final answer is: $10"
"To determine the time it takes for Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn and then divide that by his new income.

The total amount of money he needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income: $50,000/year * 4 years (loans) + $25,000/year * 4 years (lost income) = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find the time it takes to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can use the formula:

Time = Total Amount / Annual Income

Plugging in the values, we get:

Time = $300,000 / $75,000/year

Time = 4 years

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total area of fabric Jim needs, we must first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. Given that the bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of one piece of fabric is calculated as length multiplied by width, so the area of one piece is 8 \* 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim requires two pieces, the total area is 2 \* 80 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the total number of letters delivered by the post office from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and sum them together.

Let's start with Monday. The post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. To find one-fifth of 425, we divide 425 by 5:

$$\frac{425}{5} = 85$$

Then, we add 17 to this result to find the total number of letters delivered on Tuesday:

$$85 + 17 = 102$$

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. To find twice as many as Tuesday, we multiply 102 by 2:

$$102 \times 2 = 204$$

Then, we add 5 to this result to find the total number of letters delivered on Wednesday:

$$204 + 5 = 209$$

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day:

$$425 + 102 + 209 = 736$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{736}$"
"To determine the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad can be calculated as follows:

10 people * $6.50 per person = 10 × 6.50 = $65

The cost of the pasta salad can be calculated as follows:

6 people * $6 per person = 6 × 6 = $36

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad:

Total cost = $65 + $36
Total cost = $65 + 36
Total cost = $101

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.

The final answer is: $101"
"To calculate the average loss, we need to determine the total loss and then divide it by the number of races.

Let's denote the amount lost in the first race as $L1 = -$5.

In the second race, the amount won is $1 more than twice the amount lost in the first race, which can be expressed as 2L1 + $1. Substituting the value of L1, we get 2(-$5) + $1 = -$9.

In the third race, the amount lost is 1.5 times the amount won in the second race, which can be expressed as 1.5(2L1 + $1). Substituting the value of L1, we get 1.5(2(-$5) + $1) = 1.5(-$9) = -$13.50.

Now, let's calculate the total loss: L_total = L1 + (2L1 + $1) + 1.5(2L1 + $1) = -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.50) = -$27.50.

The number of races is 3.

To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races: L_avg = L_total / 3 = -$27.50 / 3 = -$9.17.

"To determine the total population of South America, we can apply the fundamental principles of arithmetic operations. Given that there are 26 countries in South America, each with 5 cities, and each city has a population of 1000 people, we can calculate the total population by multiplying these values.

Let's denote the number of countries as C = 26, the number of cities per country as N = 5, and the population per city as P = 1000.

The total number of cities in South America is the product of the number of countries and the number of cities per country: C × N = 26 × 5 = 130.

Now, to find the total population, we multiply the total number of cities by the population per city: (C × N) × P = 130 × 1000 = 130,000.

Therefore, the total population of South America is 130,000.

The final answer is: 130000"
"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier's height can be calculated by converting his height from feet to inches and then adding the growth. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches. Adding the 3 inches he grew over the summer, Xavier's current height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

Similarly, Cole's height can be calculated by adding the 2 inches he grew over the summer to his initial height of 50 inches. Therefore, Cole's current height is 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier by subtracting Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

Therefore, the share of the first person is $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To calculate the total hours worked by each painter, we need to break down the problem into manageable components.

First, let's determine the total number of days worked. Since there are 7 days in a week, 3 weeks is equivalent to 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Next, we need to convert the fraction of a day worked by the painters to hours. The painters worked 3/8ths of a day, which can be converted to hours as follows:

$$\frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9$$

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days to find the total hours worked:

$$9 \text{ hours/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 189 \text{ hours}$$

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to find the hours worked by each painter:

$$\frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{47.25}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x.

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides:

2.5x = 15

Divide both sides by 2.5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To calculate the price of the car in 2010, we can use the formula for exponential decay, which is given by:

P(t) = P0 * (1 - r)^t

where P(t) is the price at time t, P0 is the initial price, r is the depreciation rate, and t is the time in years.

Given that the initial price of the car is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% or 0.21, and the time period is from 2007 to 2010, which is 3 years, we can plug in the values as follows:

P(3) = 20000 * (1 - 0.21)^3
= 20000 * (0.79)^3
= 20000 * 0.4914
= 9828

The final answer is: $9828"
"To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we need to calculate the number of books written in English and German first. 

The number of English books is half of the total number of books, which is $\frac{50}{2} = 25$. 

The number of German books is 10% of the total number of books, which is $50 \times 0.1 = 5$.

The total number of books written in English and German is $25 + 5 = 30$.

To find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the total number of English and German books from the total number of books: $50 - 30 = 20$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the remaining distance Bernice needs to drive, we can apply a simple subtraction operation. Given that the total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is 1955 kilometers, and Bernice has already driven 325 kilometers over a period of 4 days, we can calculate the remaining distance as follows:

Distance left to drive = Total distance - Distance driven
= 1955 km - 325 km
= 1630 km

Therefore, Bernice will still need to drive 1630 kilometers to reach her destination.

The final answer is: 1630"
"To determine the amount of water Ingrid drinks in gallons over a 30-day period, we need to calculate her daily water consumption in gallons and then multiply it by the number of days.

Ingrid's daily water consumption is 8 cups. To convert this to gallons, we use the conversion factor of 16 cups per gallon. 

We can express this as a fraction: 8 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 8/16 gallon/day. Simplifying this fraction, we get 1/2 gallon/day.

Now, we multiply her daily water consumption in gallons by the number of days: (1/2 gallon/day) * 30 days = 15 gallons.

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we can use a step-by-step approach to track the changes in the number of passengers.

Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, increasing the total to 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and 100 people board. The net change is 100 - 50 = 50, so the total number of people becomes 140 + 50 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 people descend from the train, leaving 190 - 80 = 110 people on the train.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To determine the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $\frac{48}{2} = 24$ dollars.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

"To determine the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and multiply it by the cost of each tile.

Given that the kitchen floor has a total area of 200 SqFt and each tile covers 1 SqFt, we can find the total number of tiles required by dividing the total area by the area of a single tile. This is a straightforward application of the formula for area:

Total number of tiles = Total area / Area of a single tile
= 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
= 200 tiles

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile:

Total cost = Number of tiles * Cost per tile
= 200 tiles * $12/tile
= $2400

Therefore, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is $2400."
"To determine the increased cost of James' insurance, we first need to calculate 60% of the normal cost, which is $120 per month. This can be done by multiplying the normal cost by the decimal equivalent of 60%, or 0.6.

60% of $120 = 0.6 \* $120 = $72

Next, we add this amount to the normal cost to find the increased cost.

Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we need to multiply it by 12 to find the annual cost.

Annual cost = $192 \* 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Let's start by calculating the total number of sheets he puts on the beds every week. Since Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed, we can calculate the total number of sheets as follows:

4 twin beds * 2 sheets/twin bed = 8 sheets
1 king size bed * 1 sheet/king bed = 1 sheet
Total sheets = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week. 

We can calculate the number of twin sets as follows:
8 sheets / 2 sheets/set = 4 sets
Since the king set is already a single set, we add it to the total number of sets:
Total sets = 4 + 1 = 5 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week:
5 sets * 1 load/set = 5 loads/week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year:
5 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 260 loads/year

The final answer is: $\boxed{260}$"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and multiply it by 4.

Let's denote the number of movies watched on Saturday as S. Given that they watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday, the number of movies watched on Sunday is S/2.

We are given that S = 4. Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is 4/2 = 2.

In one weekend, the total number of movies watched is the sum of the movies watched on Saturday and Sunday, which is S + S/2 = 4 + 2 = 6.

To find the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies watched in one weekend by 4: 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we can use a simple arithmetic progression. Let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Leo had 100 stickers two years ago. Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so the total number of stickers he had at the end of last year was 100 + 50 = 150.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers. Therefore, the total number of stickers he has this year is 150 + 100 = 250.

To find the total number of stickers in his collection, we add the stickers from all three years: 100 + 150 + 250 = 500.

"To determine the number of days the cat food will last, we need to calculate the total daily consumption of cat food and then divide the total amount of cat food available by this value.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat is fed twice a day with 60 grams of cat food. Therefore, the total daily consumption of cat food is 3 cats * 2 meals/day * 60 grams/cat * meal = 360 grams/day.

Now, we can divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the total daily consumption (360 grams/day) to find the number of days it will last: 

$$\frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days}$$

"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the total number of slices available. Since each pizza has 8 slices and there are 4 pizzas, the total number of slices is given by the product of these two quantities:

Total slices = 8 slices/pizza * 4 pizzas = 32 slices

We are given that Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can express Jake's slices as:

Jake's slices = Becky's slices - 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

We are also given that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, Silvia's slices can be expressed as:

Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding Becky's, Jake's, and Silvia's slices:

Total slices eaten = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices eaten = 31

"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can express Betsy's time as x + 18.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x is the time Donovan's part took, and Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

The final answer is: 58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to break down the expenses into their individual components.

First, let's consider the cost of the cast, which is a fixed expense of $200.

Next, we have the cost of the doctor's visit, which is $300 per hour. Since the visit lasted for 30 minutes, we need to calculate the cost for half an hour. To do this, we can multiply the hourly rate by 0.5, as there are 60 minutes in an hour.

$$\text{Cost of visit} = 300 \times 0.5 = 150$$

The cost of the painkillers is calculated by multiplying the number of pills by the cost per pill. In this case, Hannah received 30 painkillers at $4 each.

$$\text{Cost of painkillers} = 30 \times 4 = 120$$

Finally, we have the cost of parking, which is a fixed expense of $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours. To calculate the total cost of parking, we multiply the hourly rate by the minimum number of hours.

$$\text{Cost of parking} = 6 \times 2 = 12$$

Now, let's add the costs together to find the total cost of the doctor's visit.

$$\text{Total cost} = 200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482$$

The final answer is: $482"
"To determine the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we first need to calculate the number of emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is equivalent to 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

Now, we can calculate the total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week by multiplying the daily number of emails he responds to by 5:

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To determine the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we can calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then sum them up.

Let's start by identifying the number of classes that visited each day:

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: 2 * 32 = 64 classes (since twice as many visited on Tuesday)
- Wednesday: 3 * 32 = 96 classes (since three times as many visited on Wednesday)
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, we can add up the total number of classes that visited:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 207

Therefore, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 207.

The final answer is: 207"
"To calculate the average score, we need to find the arithmetic mean of the test scores. The formula for the arithmetic mean is:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} \]

Given that John scored 100 on his first three tests and 80 on his fourth test, we can calculate the sum of his scores as follows:

\[ \text{Sum of scores} = 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380 \]

Now, we divide the sum by the number of tests to find the average score:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

Therefore, John's average score across the four tests is 95."
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

Let's start by calculating the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. This can be expressed as:

20 x 0.7 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

Next, we'll calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which can be expressed as:

40 x 0.8 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

Now, we'll add the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas eaten:

14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas eaten in total.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

To find the number of pizzas left, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered:

60 - 46 = 14 pizzas left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total cost of postage for Anthony's pizza parlor coupons, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small and big coupons separately and then sum the results.

Let's denote the number of small coupons as S and the number of big coupons as B. We are given that S = 700 and B = 2S = 2 * 700 = 1400.

The cost per small coupon is $0.05, and the cost per big coupon is $0.15. Therefore, the total cost of mailing small coupons is 0.05S = 0.05 * 700 = $35, and the total cost of mailing big coupons is 0.15B = 0.15 * 1400 = $210.

The total cost of postage is the sum of the costs for small and big coupons: $35 + $210 = $245.

The final answer is: $245"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. Let's start by determining the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. We know that Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This can be expressed as:

10 - 3 = 7

So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is:

7 × 4 = 28

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. This leaves us with:

7 - 4 = 3

meatball sub sandwiches. Sidney then ordered 3 more sub sandwiches, bringing the total to:

3 + 3 = 6

meatball sub sandwiches. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 sub sandwiches is:

6 × 4 = 24

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"Given that Mr. Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, and a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures, we can calculate the number of trucks that reached the farmers as follows:

Let's denote the total number of trucks as T = 20. The number of trucks with mechanical failures is T/4 = 20/4 = 5.

The number of trucks that reached the farmers is T - (T/4) = 20 - 5 = 15.

Now, we can calculate the total tons of fertiliser delivered by multiplying the number of trucks that reached the farmers by the tons per truck: 15 * 20 = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 300.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine the cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion, we can break down the problem as follows:

Let's consider the cost of 6 pounds of butter as 3 sets of 2 pounds, since the promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off.

For each set of 2 pounds, the cost is:
\[ \text{Cost} = 2 \times \left( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{price} + \text{price} \right) \]
where price is the cost of one pound of butter, which is $4.00.

Substituting the value of price into the equation:
\[ \text{Cost} = 2 \times \left( \frac{1}{2} \times 4 + 4 \right) \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 2 \times \left( 2 + 4 \right) \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 2 \times 6 \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 12 \]

Since we have 3 sets of 2 pounds, the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 3 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 36 \]

However, this is the cost for 6 pounds of butter without the promotion. To apply the promotion, we need to calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter with the buy one pound get one half off promotion.

The cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion is:
\[ \text{Cost with Promotion} = 2 \times 4 + 3 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost with Promotion} = 8 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Cost with Promotion} = 14 \]

The final answer is: $14"
"To determine the total cost of Kayla's party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests and multiply it by the cost per guest, then add the initial fee.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Total invited guests: 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) = 45
2. Guests who could not come: 4
3. Total guests attending: 45 - 4 = 41
4. Additional guests: 41 - 20 (initial guests) = 21
5. Cost per additional guest: $6
6. Cost for additional guests: 21 * 6 = $126
7. Initial fee: $125
8. Total cost: $126 + $125 = $251

The total cost of the party is $251."
"Given that Maggie and Riza each had $60 initially, we can calculate the amount of money they have left after spending a portion of their funds.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Maggie and Riza had as M and R, respectively. We know that M = R = $60.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her money left. This can be expressed as:

M - (1/4)M = (3/4)M

Since M = $60, we can substitute this value into the equation:

(3/4)M = (3/4)($60) = $45

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has 2/3 of her money left. This can be expressed as:

R - (1/3)R = (2/3)R

Since R = $60, we can substitute this value into the equation:

(2/3)R = (2/3)($60) = $40

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add the money Maggie and Riza have:

Total money left = (3/4)M + (2/3)R
= $45 + $40
= $85

The final answer is: $85"
"To determine the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys. 

Let's denote the number of bananas the first monkey eats as $x$. Since the second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, the number of bananas the second monkey eats is $x + 4$.

The total number of bananas the first two monkeys eat each day is $x + (x + 4) = 2x + 4$.

We know that the total number of bananas is 315 and they last for a week, which is 7 days. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315. To find the total number of bananas eaten each day, we divide 315 by 7:

$$\frac{315}{7} = 45$$

Now, we know that the total number of bananas eaten each day is 45. We also know that the first two monkeys eat $2x + 4$ bananas each day. Since the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day, the number of bananas the third monkey eats is $45 - (2x + 4)$.

However, we can also express the total number of bananas eaten each day as the sum of the bananas eaten by each monkey. Since the first monkey eats $x$ bananas, the second monkey eats $x + 4$ bananas, and the third monkey eats the rest, we can write the equation:

$$x + (x + 4) + (45 - (2x + 4)) = 45$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$2x + 45 - 2x = 45$$

The $x$ terms cancel out, and we are left with:

$$45 = 45$$

This equation is true for any value of $x$, but we can use the fact that the first monkey eats 10 bananas each day to find the value of $x$. Since the first monkey eats 10 bananas, we can set up the equation:

$$x = 10$$

Now that we know the value of $x$, we can find the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day:

$$45 - (2x + 4) = 45 - (2(10) + 4) = 45 - 24 = 21$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he placed. 

Let's break it down: Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, which is equivalent to 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Next, he completed another 500-piece puzzle. To find the total number of pieces he placed, we add the pieces from both puzzles: 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

Therefore, Teddy placed a total of 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine the number of quarters Jenny leaves with after purchasing the roses, we need to calculate the total cost of the flowers and the change she receives.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses. Since 15 roses is 1 and 3 roses, it's more cost-effective to buy them by the dozen. 1 dozen roses cost $15, and 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total revenue from each item and then sum them together.

The revenue from milkshakes is given by the product of the number of milkshakes sold and the price per milkshake: 6 × $5.50 = $33.

The revenue from burger platters is given by the product of the number of platters sold and the price per platter: 9 × $11 = $99.

The revenue from sodas is given by the product of the number of sodas sold and the price per soda: 20 × $1.50 = $30.

Now, we can calculate the total revenue by summing the revenues from each item: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To determine the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

Let's break down the information:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. Therefore, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is 0 minutes, Paul needs to wait from 0 to 145 minutes for the fourth train. However, we need to consider the time he waits from the first train's arrival to the fourth train's arrival.

Let's calculate the time Paul waits for each train:

- Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train.
- He waits from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train.
- He waits from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train.
- He waits from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is the sum of these intervals: 
\[ \text{Total Time} = (10 + 30) + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = 40 + 30 + 60 + 20 \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = 150 \]

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider that Paul waits for the first train to arrive, then waits for the time between the first and second trains, then waits for the time between the second and third trains, and finally waits for the time between the third and fourth trains.

The correct calculation is:
\[ \text{Total Time} = 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = 120 \]

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far. Given that she saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

S = n/2 * (a1 + an)

where S is the total number of toothpicks saved, n is the number of weeks, a1 is the first term (10 toothpicks), and an is the last term (10 toothpicks).

However, since the series is arithmetic with a constant difference, we can also use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

S = n * a1 + (n-1) * d/2

where d is the common difference (0 toothpicks in this case, since the difference between consecutive terms is 0, but we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series with a constant term).

S = 12 * 10 + (12-1) * 0
S = 120

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs:
200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks

Now, we can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence to find the number of weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks:

n = (an - a1) / d + 1

However, since the difference between consecutive terms is 0, we can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence with a constant term:

n = (S - a1) / d + 1

where S is the total number of toothpicks saved, a1 is the first term (10 toothpicks), and d is the common difference (0 toothpicks).

n = (80 - 10) / 0 + 1
n = 70 / 0 + 1
n = undefined + 1
n = ∞ + 1
n = ∞

However, this is not a valid solution since the number of weeks cannot be infinite. We can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence with a constant term:

n = (S - a1) / d + 1
n = (80 - 10) / 10 + 1
n = 70 / 10 + 1
n = 7 + 1
n = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

Let's denote the original price of the watch as $P = 2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, which can be expressed as 0.75P. Therefore, the price he paid is 0.75P = 2000 * 0.75 = $1500.

Next, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which can be expressed as 1.2(0.75P). Therefore, the price his friend paid is 1.2(0.75P) = 1.2 * 1500 = $1800.

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is the difference between the original price and the price he paid, which is P - 1.2(0.75P) = 2000 - 1800 = $200.

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
\[
\frac{200}{2000} \times 100 = 10\%
\]

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs and the rate at which they create jellyfish per second.

First, we calculate the total number of seconds in 4 hours:

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5. Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds is:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"Given that Binkie's score is 90, we can express Frankie's score as a function of Binkie's score. Let's denote Binkie's score as B and Frankie's score as F. We are given that F = 2B + 15.

Substituting B = 90 into the equation, we get F = 2(90) + 15.

Using the order of operations, we first multiply 2 by 90, which gives us 180. Then, we add 15 to 180.

F = 180 + 15
F = 195

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195.

The final answer is: $\boxed{195}$"
"To determine the time it took James to reach the store, we must first calculate the total distance he walked. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back, the total distance is twice the distance to the store, which is 2 * 4 = 8 miles.

Given that James walks at a constant speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula for time, which is time = distance / speed. Substituting the values, we get time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour.

Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

Therefore, the time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the cost of each approach.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas purchased: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost would be: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Given that Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam, we can model this situation using a linear equation.

Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet. The total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

Therefore, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the rate at which the crocodile grows per year, we can use the formula:

Growth rate = Total growth / Number of years

Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can calculate the growth rate as follows:

Growth rate = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth rate = 2 inches/year

Now, to find the total growth in 13 years, we can multiply the growth rate by the number of years:

Total growth in 13 years = Growth rate * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

The final answer is: 26"
"To determine Marcel's total earnings from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

Let's start by finding the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field, we need to consider the production and consumption rates of the farmer and the truck driver. The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, while the truck driver consumes 3 bales per hour.

Given that both the farmer and the truck driver work for 6 hours, we can calculate the total production and consumption as follows:

Production (farmer) = 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 5 * 6 = 30 bales
Consumption (truck driver) = 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 3 * 6 = 18 bales

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the consumption from the production: 30 - 18 = 12 bales.

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the total minutes spent in class and the additional minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's find the total minutes spent in class. John has 6 regular periods and 2 extra classes, each lasting 40 minutes. The total minutes spent in class per day is given by:

$$\text{minutes per day} = (6 + 2) \times 40 = 8 \times 40 = 320 \text{ minutes}$$

Since John attends classes 5 days a week, the total minutes spent in class per week is:

$$\text{minutes per week} = 320 \times 5 = 1600 \text{ minutes}$$

Next, we need to find the total minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. The total minutes in a week is:

$$\text{minutes per week} = 7 \times 24 \times 60 = 1680 \text{ minutes}$$

Therefore, the minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday is:

$$\text{minutes per week} = \frac{1}{16} \times 1680 = 105 \text{ minutes}$$

Since John spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total minutes spent on these days is:

$$\text{minutes per week} = 105 \times 2 = 210 \text{ minutes}$$

Now, we can find the total minutes spent learning per week by adding the minutes spent in class and the minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday:

$$\text{total minutes per week} = 1600 + 210 = 1810 \text{ minutes}$$

Finally, we convert the total minutes to hours:

$$\text{hours per week} = \frac{1810}{60} = 30.17 \text{ hours}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{30.17}$"
"Given the scenario, we can model the height of the ball after each bounce using a geometric sequence. The initial height of the ball is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet. 

The common ratio (r) of the geometric sequence is 2/3, representing the proportion of the height retained after each bounce. To find the height of the ball after the second bounce, we can use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence: a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1), where a_1 is the initial term and n is the term number.

For the second bounce, n = 2. Plugging in the values, we get:

a_2 = 72 * (2/3)^(2-1)
a_2 = 72 * (2/3)^1
a_2 = 72 * 2/3
a_2 = 48

Therefore, the height of the ball after the second bounce is 48 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we'll convert the height of the first child to inches and then calculate the height of each child step by step.

Let's start by converting the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height of the first child in inches is $6 \times 12 = 72$ inches.

Now, we can calculate the height of the second child, which is two inches taller than the first child: $72 + 2 = 74$ inches.

Next, we'll find the height of the third child, which is 5 inches shorter than the second child: $74 - 5 = 69$ inches.

Finally, we'll determine the height of the fourth child, which is three inches taller than the third child: $69 + 3 = 72$ inches.

The height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To determine the total earnings of the apple orchard, we need to calculate the number of bags sold and then multiply it by the price per bag. Given that each bag contains 10 apples and the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples, we can find the number of bags by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag.

$$\frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples per bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}$$

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag, which is $5.

$$200 \text{ bags} \times \$5 \text{ per bag} = \$1000$$

Therefore, the total earnings of the apple orchard for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag is $1000.

The final answer is: $1000"
"To determine the original weight of the triceratops, we can use a step-by-step approach based on the information provided.

Let's denote the original weight of the triceratops as $x$ kilograms. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, which is $\frac{x}{2}$ kilograms. The velociraptors then scavenged half of the remaining meat, which is $\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = \frac{x}{4}$ kilograms.

We are given that the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which is half of what the velociraptors had. Therefore, the velociraptors had $2 \times 270 = 540$ kilograms of meat. Since the velociraptors had $\frac{x}{4}$ kilograms of meat, we can set up the equation:

$$\frac{x}{4} = 540$$

To solve for $x$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

$$x = 540 \times 4$$

$$x = 2160$$

Therefore, the original weight of the triceratops was 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2160}$"
"To determine the cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet. The total area of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.2857%

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.29}$"
"Given two trains departing from a station in opposite directions, with one train traveling at 60 miles per hour and the other at half that speed, we can calculate the distance between them after 3 hours.

Let's denote the speed of the first train as $v_1 = 60$ miles per hour and the speed of the second train as $v_2 = \frac{1}{2}v_1 = 30$ miles per hour.

The distance traveled by the first train after 3 hours is given by $d_1 = v_1 \cdot t = 60 \cdot 3 = 180$ miles.

Similarly, the distance traveled by the second train after 3 hours is $d_2 = v_2 \cdot t = 30 \cdot 3 = 90$ miles.

The total distance between the two trains is the sum of their individual distances, which is $d_{total} = d_1 + d_2 = 180 + 90 = 270$ miles.

Therefore, the distance between the two trains after 3 hours is 270 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the total number of people Billy helps, we first need to calculate the number of days he is available to work. The period in question spans from March 1st to April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. Therefore, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we can find the number of days off by multiplying 50 by 0.2:
50 \* 0.2 = 10

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy is available to work:
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he can help per day is 2 \* 3 = 6.

To find the total number of people Billy helps, we multiply the number of days he is available to work by the number of people he can help per day:
40 \* 6 = 240

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of individuals transported by the buses and the private cars. 

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the private cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the private cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we can infer that the number of people inside the church is equal to the number of people transported, assuming that all individuals present were transported by the buses or private cars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To determine Jeff's age, we need to establish the age relationships between the three individuals. Given that Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can express this as:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. This can be represented as:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the time difference between riding the biggest and the second biggest waterslides, we need to calculate the time it takes to ride each slide. 

The time to ride the biggest slide is given by the formula: time = distance / speed. For the biggest slide, the distance is 300 feet and the speed is 60 feet/minute. Therefore, the time to ride the biggest slide is:

time = 300 / 60 = 5 minutes

The time to ride the second biggest slide is given by the same formula, with a distance of 240 feet and a speed of 80 feet/minute. Therefore, the time to ride the second biggest slide is:

time = 240 / 80 = 3 minutes

Now, we can find the time difference between the two slides by subtracting the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide:

time difference = 5 - 3 = 2 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total time spent on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. The total time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes. 

The total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60/60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of miles Ahito ran, we need to first calculate the total miles run by Micah. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can express this relationship as a multiplication operation.

Let's denote the miles run by Micah as M and the miles run by Amber as A. We know that M = 3.5A and A = 8.

M = 3.5A
M = 3.5(8)
M = 28

Now, we can use the fact that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can express this as an equation:

A + M + Ahito's miles = 52

Substituting the values we know, we get:

8 + 28 + Ahito's miles = 52

Combine like terms:

36 + Ahito's miles = 52

Subtract 36 from both sides:

Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item and then add that to the initial charge.

First, let's calculate the new balance after the return:

Initial charge: $85.00
Return: -$15.00
New balance = Initial charge - Return
New balance = $85.00 - $15.00
New balance = $70.00

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the frying pan and the towels after the discount.

Frying pan: The original price is $20.00, and it's on sale for 20% off.
Discount = 20% of $20.00
Discount = 0.20 * $20.00
Discount = $4.00
Price of frying pan = Original price - Discount
Price of frying pan = $20.00 - $4.00
Price of frying pan = $16.00

Towels: The original price is $30.00, and they're on sale for 10% off.
Discount = 10% of $30.00
Discount = 0.10 * $30.00
Discount = $3.00
Price of towels = Original price - Discount
Price of towels = $30.00 - $3.00
Price of towels = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the new purchases:

Total cost of new purchases = Price of frying pan + Price of towels
Total cost of new purchases = $16.00 + $27.00
Total cost of new purchases = $43.00

Finally, we add the total cost of the new purchases to the new balance:

New balance = New balance + Total cost of new purchases
New balance = $70.00 + $43.00
New balance = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Given the problem, we can approach it by first identifying the proportion of jellyfish that change color under UV light. We know that a third of the large jellyfish change color, and a fifth of the total jellyfish are large. Therefore, the proportion of jellyfish that change color is (1/3) * (1/5) = 1/15 of the total jellyfish.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so we can set up the equation:

(1/15)x = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"Given the problem, we can establish a linear relationship between the ages of the three individuals. Let's denote Chris's age as C, Ben's age as B, and Caroline's age as A.

We are given that Chris is 4 years old, so C = 4.

We also know that Ben is two times older than Chris, which can be expressed as B = 2C.

Substituting the value of C into the equation, we get B = 2(4) = 8.

Now, we are told that Caroline is three times older than Ben, which can be expressed as A = 3B.

Substituting the value of B into the equation, we get A = 3(8) = 24.

Therefore, Caroline's age is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of years Lauren needs to work to save for retirement, we must first calculate the total amount she needs to save. Given that she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary of $100,000 in retirement, her annual retirement income will be:

$$
\text{Annual retirement income} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
$$

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:

$$
\text{Total savings needed} = \text{Annual retirement income} \times \text{Number of years in retirement} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
$$

Now, we can calculate the number of years it will take her to save this amount at a rate of $20,000 per year:

$$
\text{Number of years} = \frac{\text{Total savings needed}}{\text{Annual savings}} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40
$$

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save for her retirement.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the length of each final cut, we need to apply the concept of division to find the length of each part after the initial cut and then further divide that result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into.

First, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into: 

$$\frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}$$

This gives us the length of each of the four equal parts after the initial cut. Now, we need to divide this result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into:

$$\frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}$$

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the given information that 40% of the school population is comprised of 240 boys. 

First, we need to express the percentage as a decimal: 40% = 0.4. 

Now, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of students: 0.4x = 240, where x represents the total number of students.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.4: x = 240 / 0.4.

x = 600

This means the total number of students in the school is 600. 

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we can multiply the total number of students by the decimal equivalent of 60%: 0.6 * 600 = 360.

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"To determine the total amount spent at the gardening shop, we need to apply the principle of subtraction after addition. This is a straightforward arithmetic operation that involves calculating the total cost of the items purchased and then subtracting the discount.

First, we add the cost of the pots and the garden soil: $19 + $26 = $45.

Next, we apply the discount of $7 to the total cost: $45 - $7 = $38.

Therefore, the total amount spent at the gardening shop is $38.

The final answer is: $38"
"To calculate the average height of heels at the party, we need to find the mean of the heights of the heels. 

Let's denote the height of the 4-inch heels as $H_4$ and the height of the 2-inch heels as $H_2$. We have three women wearing each type of heel.

The total height of the 4-inch heels is $3 \cdot H_4 = 3H_4$ inches.
The total height of the 2-inch heels is $3 \cdot H_2 = 3H_2$ inches.

The total height of all the heels is $3H_4 + 3H_2$ inches.

The average height of heels is the total height divided by the total number of women, which is 6. Therefore, the average height of heels is $\frac{3H_4 + 3H_2}{6}$ inches.

Simplifying the expression, we get $\frac{H_4 + H_2}{2}$ inches.

Since $H_4 = 4$ inches and $H_2 = 2$ inches, the average height of heels is $\frac{4 + 2}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3$ inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the additional miles Soledad must hike per day to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Let's denote the number of miles Soledad hikes per day as $x$. Since she plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, her daily mileage is $2 \times 125 = 250$ miles.

To find the number of days required to hike 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the daily mileage: $\frac{9,300}{250} = 37.2$ days.

However, Soledad only has 30 days in June. To find the total miles she can hike in 30 days at 250 miles per day, we multiply the daily mileage by the number of days: $250 \times 30 = 7,500$ miles.

The difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the miles she can hike in 30 days is $9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800$ miles.

To find the additional miles per day she must hike, we divide the difference by the number of days: $\frac{1,800}{30} = 60$ miles per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the total revenue the store will receive from selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of ball and then sum these values.

Let's denote the number of red balls as R = 3, the number of blue balls as B = 11, and the number of green balls as G = 25. The cost of each type of ball is given as $9 for red, $5 for blue, and $3 for green.

The revenue from selling the red balls can be calculated as R * 9 = 3 * 9 = $27.

The revenue from selling the blue balls can be calculated as B * 5 = 11 * 5 = $55.

The revenue from selling the green balls can be calculated as G * 3 = 25 * 3 = $75.

To find the total revenue, we sum the revenues from each type of ball: Total Revenue = R * 9 + B * 5 + G * 3 = 27 + 55 + 75 = $157.

The final answer is: $157"
"To determine the amount of apples James will have left, we need to calculate the portions taken by Pierre and Paul. 

Pierre wants a quarter of the 12 kg of apples, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3$ kg. 

Paul wants one-third of the 12 kg of apples, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4$ kg.

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is the sum of their individual portions: $3 + 4 = 7$ kg.

To find the amount left for James, we subtract the total taken by Pierre and Paul from the initial amount: $12 - 7 = 5$ kg.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the temperature in the morning, we need to apply a simple arithmetic operation involving the initial temperature, the temperature drop, and the temperature increase.

Let's denote the initial temperature as $T_i = 2^\circ C$, the temperature drop as $\Delta T_d = -8^\circ C$, and the temperature increase as $\Delta T_i = 3^\circ C$.

The temperature in the morning can be calculated using the formula:

$T_m = T_i + \Delta T_d + \Delta T_i$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$T_m = 2^\circ C - 8^\circ C + 3^\circ C$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$T_m = -3^\circ C$

Therefore, the temperature in the morning is $-3^\circ C$.

"To determine the amount of money Raymond has left, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. 

Let's denote the initial amount of money Raymond had as $21. He then saved $11 from his allowance, which can be represented as an addition operation: $21 + $11 = $32.

Next, we need to account for the expenses. He spent $5 on a comic book, which can be represented as a subtraction operation: $32 - $5 = $27. Then, he spent $19 on a puzzle, which can be represented as another subtraction operation: $27 - $19 = $8.

Therefore, the amount of money Raymond has left is $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the cost of each book, we need to calculate the total amount spent on the books. Given that Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, her remaining budget is $16 - $4 = $12.

After purchasing the two books, she had $2 left, indicating that the total amount spent on the books is $12 - $2 = $10.

Since both books cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent on the books by 2.

$$\frac{\$10}{2} = \$5$$

Therefore, each book cost $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"To determine the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year, we need to calculate the 20% increase in enrollment from last year.

The formula to find the increase is: Increase = (Percentage Increase / 100) * Previous Year's Enrollment
Increase = (20 / 100) * 50
Increase = 0.20 * 50
Increase = 10

Now, we add the increase to the previous year's enrollment to find the current year's enrollment: Current Year's Enrollment = Previous Year's Enrollment + Increase
Current Year's Enrollment = 50 + 10
Current Year's Enrollment = 60

Therefore, the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year is 60."
"To determine the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to calculate the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

Given that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can find the rate per minute by dividing the number of blinks by the number of minutes:

$$\frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute}.$$

Now, we can find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:

$$\frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes}.$$

Therefore, the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times is 9 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the difference between the number of female and male fishes in Tate's garden pond, we need to calculate the total number of each sex.

Let's start by calculating the total number of male fishes. We have 4 male guppies and 3 male goldfishes initially, and Tate buys 2 more male guppies and 2 male goldfishes. Therefore, the total number of male fishes is:

Total male fishes = 4 (initial male guppies) + 2 (additional male guppies) + 3 (initial male goldfishes) + 2 (additional male goldfishes)
Total male fishes = 4 + 2 + 3 + 2
Total male fishes = 11

Next, we calculate the total number of female fishes. We have 7 female guppies and 5 female goldfishes initially, and Tate buys 1 more female guppy and 3 female goldfishes. Therefore, the total number of female fishes is:

Total female fishes = 7 (initial female guppies) + 1 (additional female guppy) + 5 (initial female goldfishes) + 3 (additional female goldfishes)
Total female fishes = 7 + 1 + 5 + 3
Total female fishes = 16

Now, we can find the difference between the number of female and male fishes by subtracting the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:

Difference = Total female fishes - Total male fishes
Difference = 16 - 11
Difference = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total time taken by Amalia, Megan, and Dior to complete their chores, we need to calculate the time taken by each individual and sum them up.

Let's denote the time taken by Amalia as A, Megan as M, and Dior as D. We are given that:

A = 4 hours (time taken by Amalia to mow the lawn)

M = A + 2 hours (time taken by Megan to walk the dog, which is 2 hours longer than Amalia)

D = A + 4 hours (time taken by Dior to do laundry, which is 4 hours longer than Amalia)

Substituting the value of A into the expressions for M and D, we get:

M = 4 + 2 = 6 hours
D = 4 + 4 = 8 hours

Now, we can calculate the total time taken by adding the individual times:

Total time = A + M + D
= 4 + 6 + 8
= 18 hours

Therefore, the total time taken by Amalia, Megan, and Dior to complete their chores is 18 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the total distance John drives in a month, we need to calculate the distance of a round trip and then multiply it by the number of times he visits his parents.

First, let's calculate the distance of a one-way trip using the formula:

Distance = Speed × Time

Given that John drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to reach his parents, we can substitute these values into the formula:

Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since it's a round trip, we need to multiply the one-way distance by 2:

Total Distance = 2 × 140 miles
Total Distance = 280 miles

Now, we know that John visits his parents twice a month. To find the total distance he drives in a month, we multiply the total distance of a round trip by 2:

Total Distance per Month = 280 miles × 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

"Given that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, and Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate the total distance she will cover in 7 days as follows:

Total distance walked by Sofie = 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can express Brian's distance as a fraction of Sofie's distance:

Brian's distance = (1/2) * Sofie's distance
= (1/2) * 70 miles
= 35 miles

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"Given that a toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys and 5 workers are available to work on the order, we can break down the production rate of the workers as follows:

2 workers produce 6 toys per hour, so their combined production rate is 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour.
2 workers produce 4 toys per hour, so their combined production rate is 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.
The total production rate of these 4 workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Let's denote the production rate of the fifth worker as x toys per hour. The total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is given by the equation:

(20 + x) * 10 = 420

Simplifying the equation, we get:

200 + 10x = 420

Subtracting 200 from both sides of the equation, we get:

10x = 220

Dividing both sides of the equation by 10, we get:

x = 22

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 22 toys per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog and then sum them.

Let's denote Kory's dog as K, Elijah's first dog as E1, and Elijah's second dog as E2. We are given that K = 60 pounds.

E1 is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so E1 = K/4 = 60/4 = 15 pounds.

E2 is half the weight of Kory's dog, so E2 = K/2 = 60/2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can find the total weight of Elijah's dogs by adding E1 and E2: E1 + E2 = 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: K + (E1 + E2) = 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{105}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a series of algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the initial number of stickers Seth had as S.

From the problem statement, we know that Luis received half of Seth's stickers, so Luis had S/2 stickers. Kris then received half of Luis's stickers, which is (S/2)/2 = S/4 stickers. We are also given that Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: S/4 = 9 + 7. This equation represents the fact that the number of stickers Kris received (S/4) is equal to the number of stickers Kris kept (9) plus the number of stickers Kris gave to Rob (7).

Solving for S, we get:

S/4 = 16
S = 16 * 4
S = 64

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is: 64"
"To determine the total number of small bags John can make, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's and then divide by the number of M&M's per small bag.

First, we calculate the total number of M&M's. Since John buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, we multiply the number of large bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Total M&M's = 3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag * 30 M&M's per ounce
Total M&M's = 3 * 10 * 30
Total M&M's = 900

Now, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag to find the number of small bags.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag
Number of small bags = 900 / 10
Number of small bags = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to calculate half of the circumference of the earth.

The circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. To find half of this value, we can use the following calculation:

$$\frac{1}{2} \times 40,000\ \text{km} = 20,000\ \text{km}$$

Now, we need to divide the total distance (20,000 km) by the distance Alfie flies per day (400 km) to find out how many days it will take him to fly that distance.

$$\frac{20,000\ \text{km}}{400\ \text{km/day}} = 50\ \text{days}$$

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we can establish a relationship between the speeds of the three cars: the average car, the 2nd fastest car, and the fastest car.

Let's denote the speed of the average car as A, the speed of the 2nd fastest car as B, and the speed of the fastest car as C. We are given that A = 120 miles per hour.

We are also given that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so B = 5A = 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

Furthermore, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so C = 1.25B = 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"Given that Liam is currently 16 years old, we can deduce his age two years ago was 14. Since his age at that time was twice the age of Vince, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Liam's age two years ago = 2 * Vince's age two years ago

Substituting the known value, we get:

14 = 2 * Vince's age two years ago

To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Vince's age two years ago = 14 / 2
Vince's age two years ago = 7

Now, to find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

Vince's current age = Vince's age two years ago + 2
Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

The final answer is: 9"
"Given that Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 Easter eggs, we can denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we have A = M.

We are also given that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so C + S = 30.

Furthermore, it is stated that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, which can be expressed as C = S + 12.

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get S + 12 + S = 30, which simplifies to 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides yields 2S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substituting the values of A, M, C, and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combining like terms gives 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2A = 26.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the total weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is given by the product of the number of crayons and the weight of each crayon: $200 \cdot 1 = 200$ ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 200 crayons, we need to find the number of boxes required to hold all the crayons. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: $\frac{200}{8} = 25$ boxes.

Now, we can find the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is given by the product of the number of boxes and the weight of each box: $25 \cdot 8 = 200$ ounces.

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes: $200 + 200 = 400$ ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: $\frac{400}{16} = 25$ pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total revenue from selling the planks, we first need to calculate the number of logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate this as follows:

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Next, we divide the total feet of usable wood by the length of each log to find the number of logs.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5 to find the total number of planks.

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Now, we calculate the total revenue by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank.

Total revenue = 80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To determine the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to calculate their individual salaries and then sum them.

Let's denote Valerie's monthly salary as V. Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we have V = $5000.

Since Valerie's brother earns 2 times what Valerie earns, his monthly salary is 2V = 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is V + 2V = 3V = $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

Now, their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her monthly salary is 2 * 3V = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: V + 2V + 3V = $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we can apply the concept of unit rates and time-distance-speed relationships. Let's denote the speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Since Grandma walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that the time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, and the distance covered is 2 miles. Using the formula time = distance/speed, we can write the equation as 40 = 2/x.

Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute. This is the unit rate at which Grandma walks on the beach.

Now that we have the speed on the beach, we can find the speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

Next, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. The distance is 1 mile, and the speed is 1/10 miles per minute. Using the formula time = distance/speed, we get time = 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time taken for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 50 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of additional weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal, we first calculate the total amount she has saved so far. Given that she saves $4 per week for 8 weeks, the total amount saved is:

$$\text{Total Amount Saved} = \text{Weekly Savings} \times \text{Number of Weeks}$$

$$\text{Total Amount Saved} = \$4/\text{week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = \$32$$

Next, we need to find the remaining amount she needs to save to reach her goal of $60:

$$\text{Remaining Amount} = \text{Goal Amount} - \text{Total Amount Saved}$$

$$\text{Remaining Amount} = \$60 - \$32 = \$28$$

Since she continues to save $4 per week, we can calculate the number of additional weeks required to reach her goal by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

$$\text{Additional Weeks} = \frac{\text{Remaining Amount}}{\text{Weekly Savings}}$$

$$\text{Additional Weeks} = \frac{\$28}{\$4/\text{week}} = 7 \text{ weeks}$$

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total number of blue birds, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the number of blue birds in the three trees with 7 birds each: 3 * 7 = 21 blue birds.

Next, we calculate the number of blue birds in the two trees with 4 birds each: 2 * 4 = 8 blue birds.

Lastly, we consider the tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, we add the number of blue birds in each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Given that Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles and ends up with 60 marbles, we can set up an equation to represent this situation. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. Therefore, the equation is x + 24 = 84, where x represents the initial number of marbles Bob has.

To solve for x, we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

x + 24 - 24 = 84 - 24
x = 60

Now that we know Bob initially has 60 marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from 60:

60 - 10 = 50

Therefore, Bob will have 50 marbles if he loses 10 marbles.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces. The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle).

We can express the total temperature of the water in the bottle as:

$$\frac{(33 + x)}{2} \cdot 5 \geq 40$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$\frac{165 + 5x}{2} \geq 40$$

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

$$165 + 5x \geq 80$$

Subtracting 165 from both sides:

$$5x \geq -85$$

Dividing both sides by 5:

$$x \geq -17$$

However, since temperature cannot be negative, the minimum value of x that satisfies the condition is 40 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Let's start with the cows. Melanie's father begins with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. The number of cows added in three weeks can be calculated as follows:

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days
= 20 * 21
= 420 cows

Now, let's add the initial number of cows to the number of cows added:

Total number of cows = 50 cows + 420 cows
= 470 cows

Next, let's consider the chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. The number of chickens added in three weeks can be calculated as follows:

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days
= 10 * 21
= 210 chickens

Now, let's add the initial number of chickens to the number of chickens added:

Total number of chickens = 20 chickens + 210 chickens
= 230 chickens

To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we add the total number of cows and chickens:

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

The final answer is: 700"
"Given the scenario, we have a straightforward problem involving a discount on a bulk purchase. The cost of each pack of bagels is $10.00, and each pack contains 9 bagels. When Russell orders 4 packs, he receives a 10% discount on the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

$$
\text{Total cost} = 4 \times \text{cost per pack} = 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00
$$

Next, we need to find the discount amount, which is 10% of the total cost:

$$
\text{Discount} = 0.10 \times \text{total cost} = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00
$$

Now, we can calculate the discounted cost by subtracting the discount from the total cost:

$$
\text{Discounted cost} = \text{total cost} - \text{discount} = \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00
$$

Since Russell orders 4 packs, each containing 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is:

$$
\text{Total bagels} = 4 \times 9 = 36
$$

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels:

$$
\text{Cost per bagel} = \frac{\text{discounted cost}}{\text{total bagels}} = \frac{\$36.00}{36} = \$1.00
$$

Therefore, the cost of each single bagel is $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To determine the number of potatoes Gomer ate, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts. Let's start by finding out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so we can express this as an algebraic expression: $23 - 5$.

Simplifying the expression, we get $23 - 5 = 18$ scoops.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be expressed as $3 - 1 = 2$ scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 2 scoops. We are given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so we can express this as $6 - 3 = 3$ potatoes per 2 scoops.

Since Gomer ate 18 scoops, and it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, we can find the number of potatoes Gomer ate by dividing the total number of scoops by 2 and then multiplying by the number of potatoes per 2 scoops: $\frac{18}{2} \cdot 3$.

Simplifying the expression, we get $\frac{18}{2} \cdot 3 = 9 \cdot 3 = 27$ potatoes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester consumes 3 eggs per day. This can be calculated as follows:

3 eggs/day * 30 days = 3 * 30 = 90 eggs

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day. This can be calculated as follows:

5 eggs/day * 30 days = 5 * 30 = 150 eggs

To find the total number of eggs consumed over the 60-day period, we add the number of eggs consumed in the first 30 days to the number of eggs consumed in the next 30 days:

Total eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since we are asked to find the number of dozens of eggs, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we can divide the total number of eggs by 12:

Total dozens = 240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of blue jellybeans, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of blue jellybeans as B, the number of green jellybeans as G, and the number of red jellybeans as R.

We are given that G = 17 and R = 2G. We also know that the total number of jellybeans is 60, so we can express this as an equation: B + G + R = 60.

Substituting the given values for G and R, we get B + 17 + 2(17) = 60.

Simplifying the equation, we get B + 17 + 34 = 60.

Combining like terms, we have B + 51 = 60.

To isolate B, we subtract 51 from both sides of the equation: B = 60 - 51.

Therefore, B = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

First, let's find the total number of lemons he gets in a year. Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree yields 6 lemons, we can express this as a simple multiplication problem:

5 trees × 6 lemons/tree = 5 × 6 = 30 lemons/year

Now, to find the total number of lemons in a decade, we multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10:

30 lemons/year × 10 years = 30 × 10 = 300 lemons

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"Given the ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9, we can express the total number of passengers as a sum of the parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 9 = 14. 

Let's denote the common multiplier as 'x'. The number of men on the bus is 5x, and the number of women is 9x. The total number of passengers is 84, so we can set up the equation: 5x + 9x = 84.

Combine like terms: 14x = 84.

Divide both sides by 14: x = 84 / 14 = 6.

Now that we have the value of 'x', we can find the number of women on the bus: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54.

Since 20 women alighted from the bus, the number of women who remained is: 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the total number of sunflowers sold by Faraday, we need to calculate the number of sunflowers sold from individual sales and bouquet sales separately.

Let's start by finding the number of sunflowers sold from individual sales. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earns $26 from individual sunflower sales per day, we can use the formula:

Number of sunflowers sold = Total daily earnings from individual sunflowers / Cost per sunflower
= $26 / $2
= 13 sunflowers/day

Next, we need to find the number of sunflowers sold from bouquet sales. Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers and Faraday earns $56 from bouquet sales per day, we can use the formula:

Number of bouquets sold = Total daily earnings from bouquets / Cost per bouquet
= $56 / $8
= 7 bouquets/day

Now, we can find the number of sunflowers sold from bouquet sales by multiplying the number of bouquets sold by the number of sunflowers per bouquet:

Number of sunflowers sold from bouquets = Number of bouquets sold * Number of sunflowers per bouquet
= 7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet
= 84 sunflowers/day

To find the total number of sunflowers sold per day, we add the number of sunflowers sold from individual sales and bouquet sales:

Total sunflowers sold per day = Number of sunflowers sold from individual sales + Number of sunflowers sold from bouquets
= 13 sunflowers/day + 84 sunflowers/day
= 97 sunflowers/day

Finally, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days by multiplying the total number of sunflowers sold per day by the number of days:

Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = Total sunflowers sold per day * Number of days
= 97 sunflowers/day * 3 days
= 291 sunflowers

The final answer is: $\boxed{291}$"
"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

Let's start by finding the number of rocks Adam can buy with his initial investment of $100. Since each rock costs $5, we can use the formula:

Number of rocks = Total investment / Cost per rock
= $100 / $5
= 20 rocks

Next, we need to find the number of rocks Adam sells. Since he sells 60% of his inventory, we can multiply the total number of rocks by 0.6:

Number of rocks sold = 0.6 * 20
= 12 rocks

Now, we can calculate the revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each:

Revenue = Number of rocks sold * Price per rock
= 12 * $7
= $84

However, Adam also has to account for the cost of the rocks he didn't sell. Since he has 20 rocks in total and sells 12, he has 8 rocks left. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

Cost of unsold rocks = Number of unsold rocks * Cost per rock
= 8 * $5
= $40

The total cost of the rocks is the sum of the cost of the rocks he sold and the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

Total cost = Cost of rocks sold + Cost of unsold rocks
= $100 + $40
= $140

Now, we can find the amount of money Adam loses by subtracting the revenue from the total cost:

Loss = Total cost - Revenue
= $140 - $84
= $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To determine the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days it will take her to complete each type of picture scene and then find the maximum of these values.

Let's denote the number of days to complete large-sized scenes as L, medium-sized scenes as M, and small-sized scenes as S. We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

L = 45 / 5 = 9
M = 36 / 6 = 6
S = 49 / 7 = 7

To find the total number of days, we need to consider the maximum of these values, as Lauren can work on multiple types of scenes in parallel. In this case, the maximum value is L = 9.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project.

Let's denote the initial number of roses as I, the number of roses given away as G, and the number of roses purchased as P. We are given the following values: I = 30, G = 24, and P = 15.

First, we subtract the number of roses given away from the initial number of roses to find the remaining roses: I - G = 30 - 24 = 6.

Next, we add the number of roses purchased to the remaining roses to find the current total: 6 + 15 = 21.

Therefore, Patricia currently has 21 roses.

"To determine the average speed of Sid's journey, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances covered in the two segments of the journey. Given that Sid traveled 110 miles in the first segment and 140 miles in the second segment, the total distance is:

Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the times taken for the two segments. Since Sid took 2 hours for the first segment and 3 hours for the second segment, the total time is:

Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
               = 250 miles / 5 hours
               = 50 miles per hour

Therefore, the average speed of Sid's journey is 50 miles per hour.

"Given that Mark purchases two lottery tickets, one with a 20% chance of winning and the other with a 60% chance of winning (three times more likely to win), we can calculate the probability of both tickets being winners using the multiplication rule for independent events.

Let's denote the probability of the first ticket winning as P(A) = 0.2 and the probability of the second ticket winning as P(B) = 0.6.

The probability of both tickets winning is given by the product of their individual probabilities:

P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B) = 0.2 × 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

P(A ∩ B) = 0.12 × 100 = 12%

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"Let's analyze the problem at hand. We have three individuals - Carlos, Jim, and Carrey - who collected seashells at the beach. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. This implies that Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

Furthermore, we are told that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as R. Then, we can express Carlos's collection as 2R. Since we know Carlos collected 22 seashells, we can write the equation 2R = 22. Solving for R, we get R = 11.

Now that we have the number of seashells each person collected, we can calculate the total number of seashells: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60.

To find out how many seashells each person gets when they divide the total number of seashells equally among themselves, we can use the formula for division: 

$$\frac{60}{3}$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$\frac{60}{3} = 20$$

Therefore, each person gets 20 seashells.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"

"To determine the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song. Given that it is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes, we can express this relationship as an equation.

Let x be the length of the first song. The second song is 60% longer, so its length can be expressed as x + 0.6x, which simplifies to 1.6x.

We are given that the first song is 5 minutes, so we can substitute x = 5 into the equation for the second song:

Length of the second song = 1.6(5) = 8 minutes

Now that we have the lengths of both songs, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs:

Total time = 5 + 8 = 13 minutes

"To determine the total profit earned by Linus, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then sum them together.

Let's denote the cost price of a single device as CP and the selling price as SP. We are given that CP = $20 and SP = 2 * CP = 2 * $20 = $40.

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices, so the total cost price is 2 * CP = 2 * $20 = $40. The total selling price for Monday is 2 * SP = 2 * $40 = $80. Therefore, the profit for Monday is SP - CP = $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices, so the total cost price is 4 * CP = 4 * $20 = $80. The total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * SP = 4 * $40 = $160. Therefore, the profit for Tuesday is SP - CP = $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Given the problem, we can establish a series of relationships between the heights of Carl, Ned, and Isabel. 

Let's denote Isabel's height as I, Ned's height as N, and Carl's height as C. We are given that I = 7 feet. 

We also know that Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so we can express this as N = I - 2. Substituting I = 7, we get N = 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

Furthermore, we are told that Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so we can express this as C = N + 1. Substituting N = 5, we get C = 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Now, we are asked to find the length of Carl's cane, which is half as long as he is tall. This can be expressed as C/2. Substituting C = 6, we get C/2 = 6/2 = 3 feet.

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet.

"To determine the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first calculate the number of bottles required to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand.

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we can find the number of bottles needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand by dividing 100 by 20, which is equivalent to multiplying by 5. Therefore, 1 person requires 5 bottles.

To find the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we multiply the number of people by the number of bottles required per person: 2300 * 5 = 11,500 bottles.

Now, to determine how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11,500 - 4,200 = 7,300.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7300}$"
"Given that Carla has given birth to identical octuplets, we can assume there are 8 babies in total. To find the number of babies wearing purple, we can calculate 3/4 of 8, which is $\frac{3}{4} \cdot 8 = 6$.

The number of babies wearing blue is 1/4 of 8, which is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 8 = 2$.

Now, let's find the number of babies wearing purple and bows. Since 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, we can calculate $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 6 = 2$.

The number of babies wearing blue and bows is given as 2.

To find the total number of babies wearing bows, we add the number of purple and blue babies wearing bows: $2 + 2 = 4$.

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple by dividing the number of purple babies wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiplying by 100:

$\frac{2}{4} \cdot 100 = 50\%$

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of tax reports received on Wednesday, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday as M + T, and the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday as T + F.

Given:
- Total reports received last week = 5168
- Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
- Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

We can express the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday as M + T = 1907, and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday as T + F = 2136.

Since we are interested in finding the number of reports received on Wednesday, we can subtract the sum of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the sum of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Let's denote the number of reports received on Wednesday as W. Then, we have:

W = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
W = 5168 - (M + T + T + F)
W = 5168 - (2T + M + F)

However, we know that M + T = 1907 and T + F = 2136. We can rewrite the equation as:

W = 5168 - (2T + 1907 + 2136)
W = 5168 - (4043)
W = 1125

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1125}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's calculate the amount of land sold in each transaction. Abraham initially owns 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50. Since half of 80 is 40, we can express this as:

$$\frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40$$

So, he sold 40 square meters of land for $50.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since 1/4 of 80 is 20, we can express this as:

$$\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20$$

So, he sold 20 square meters of land for $30.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is:

$$20 \times 3 = 60$$

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale.

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To determine Geb's age, we need to calculate half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from that value.

Given that Haley is 26 years old, we can express this as an equation: 

Haley's age = 26

Half of Haley's age can be calculated as: 

(1/2) * Haley's age = (1/2) * 26

Using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can rewrite this as: 

(1/2) * 26 = (1/2) * 20 + (1/2) * 6

Simplifying this expression, we get: 

13 + 3 = 16

However, we need to subtract 10 from this value to find Geb's age: 

16 - 10 = 6

Therefore, Geb is 6 years old.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the total number of face masks he uses in a day and then multiply it by 2.

Given that Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day can be calculated as follows:

Face masks used in a day = Number of times face mask is changed per outing × Number of outings per day
= 2 × 3
= 6

Now, to find the total number of face masks used in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks used in a day by 2:

Total face masks used in 2 days = Face masks used in a day × 2
= 6 × 2
= 12

Therefore, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is 12."
"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs hidden.

Let's denote the number of eggs hidden as $H$, the number of eggs found by Lamar as $L$, the number of eggs found by Stacy as $S$, the number of eggs found by Charlie as $C$, and the number of eggs found by Mei as $M$.

We are given the following information:

- $L = 5$
- $S = 2L = 2 \cdot 5 = 10$
- $C = S - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8$
- $M = \frac{C}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4$

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs found by all the people: $L + S + C + M = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27$.

We know that Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is equivalent to $3 \cdot 12 = 36$ eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs hidden: $H - (L + S + C + M) = 36 - 27 = 9$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we need to calculate the total number of apartments and the total amount he collects per week.

Let's start by finding the size of the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 2 * 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, which can be expressed as 1.6 times the size of the first two complexes. Therefore, the size of the third complex is 1.6 * 400 = 640 apartments.

The total number of apartments is the sum of the sizes of all three complexes: 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, he collects from 1440 * 3 = 4320 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 4320 * 0.40 = $1728.

The final answer is: $1728"
"To determine the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

Let's denote the initial number of fruits produced by a 5-year-old tree as 'F'. 

- Year 1 (5 years old): F = 50 fruits
- Year 2 (6 years old): 3F = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 3 (7 years old): 7F = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): The production of an 8-year-old tree is 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let's denote the production of a 10-year-old tree as '10F'. So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is 10F - 200.
- Year 5 (9 years old): 0 fruits (no production)
- Year 6 (10 years old): 20F = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we need to find the value of '10F' to calculate the production of an 8-year-old tree. We know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20F. 

Since a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits, we can set up the equation: 20F = 1000. Solving for F, we get F = 1000 / 20 = 50.

Now we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: 10F - 200 = 10 * 50 - 200 = 500 fruits.

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
F + 3F + 7F + (10F - 200) + 0 + 20F = 50 + 150 + 350 + 500 + 0 + 1000 = 1550

The final answer is: $\boxed{1550}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

The fraction 1/5 can be expressed as a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 1 ÷ 5 = 0.2. Alternatively, we can also express it as a percentage: 1/5 = 20%.

Now, we can calculate 20% of $100 by multiplying $100 by 0.2: $100 × 0.2 = $20.

To find the total amount of money Jack has now, we add this amount to his initial $100: $100 + $20 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Given the problem, we can establish a system of linear equations to solve for the length of the red rope. Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R.

We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7. 

We also know that R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Given that Ronnie was given $5 and Rissa was given thrice as much, we can express Rissa's initial amount as 3 times Ronnie's amount: $15.

After each of them gave an equal amount to their little sister, let's denote the amount given as 'x'. Therefore, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, which can be expressed as:

(15 - x) = (4/5) * 15

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

(15 - x) = 12

Subtracting 15 from both sides:

-x = -3

Multiplying both sides by -1:

x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with:

$5 - x = $5 - 3 = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"Given the problem, we can approach it by first recognizing that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. This implies that the other half, which consists of red, white, and purple paint, is also 6 pints.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can denote the amount of each as x. Therefore, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: 

$$\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{6}{3}$$

x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total area of Tom's house, we must calculate the area of each component and sum them together.

First, we calculate the area of one bedroom: $A_{bedroom} = l \times w = 20 \, \text{ft} \times 12 \, \text{ft} = 240 \, \text{ft}^2$. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is $4 \times A_{bedroom} = 4 \times 240 \, \text{ft}^2 = 960 \, \text{ft}^2$.

Next, we find the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom: $A_{living \, room} = 5 \times A_{bedroom} = 5 \times 240 \, \text{ft}^2 = 1200 \, \text{ft}^2$.

The remaining area of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we sum the areas together: $A_{total} = A_{bedrooms} + A_{living \, room} + A_{remaining} = 960 \, \text{ft}^2 + 1200 \, \text{ft}^2 + 1000 \, \text{ft}^2 = 3160 \, \text{ft}^2$.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3160}$"
"To determine the total number of clouds Alice counted over the five days, we can use a geometric sequence. A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.

In this case, the first term (a) is 3, and the common ratio (r) is 2, since the number of clouds doubles each day. The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:

an = a * r^(n-1)

We want to find the sum of the first five terms of the sequence, so we can use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
= 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1)
= 3 * (-31) / (-1)
= 3 * 31
= 93

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice counted over the five days is 93.

The final answer is: $\boxed{93}$"
"To determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box for $1, we first need to calculate the number of pods in the new box. Given that the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can express this as a mathematical equation:

Let x be the number of pods in the regular box. Then, the number of pods in the new box is x + 20% of x, which is equivalent to x + 0.2x = 1.2x.

We are given that the regular box contains 100 pods. Therefore, the number of pods in the new box is 1.2 * 100 = 120 pods.

Now, we can calculate the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box for $12. Since each cycle requires one pod, the number of cycles is equal to the number of pods in the new box, which is 120.

To find the number of cycles that can be run for $1, we divide the total number of cycles by 12:

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

When he loses 10 bills, he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Next, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. Therefore, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

Now, he triples his money, which is equivalent to tripling the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

The final numerical answer is: $300"
"To determine the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by team A in the first half as A1 and the number of goals scored by team B in the first half as B1. We are given that A1 = 4.

Since team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A in the first half, we can express B1 as B1 = A1 - 2. Substituting the value of A1, we get B1 = 4 - 2 = 2.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is B2 = 4 * B1 = 4 * 2 = 8.

Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is A2 = (1/4) * B2 = (1/4) * 8 = 2.

The total number of goals scored by team A is A1 + A2 = 4 + 2 = 6. The total number of goals scored by team B is B1 + B2 = 2 + 8 = 10.

The total number of goals scored in the match is A1 + A2 + B1 + B2 = 4 + 2 + 2 + 8 = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate the remaining length of the chalk after Monday and then find out how many days it will last at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's start by finding the remaining length of the chalk after Monday. The teacher used 45% of the chalk, so the remaining chalk is 55% of the original 5 inches.

$$\frac{55}{100} \cdot 5 = \frac{11}{20} \cdot 5 = \frac{55}{20} = 2.75$$

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

$$\frac{20}{100} \cdot 2.75 = \frac{1}{5} \cdot 2.75 = \frac{2.75}{5} = 0.55$$

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

$$0.55x = 2.75$$

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

$$x = \frac{2.75}{0.55}$$

$$x = \frac{275}{55}$$

$$x = 5$$

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk."
"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we need to calculate the total number of students on varsity and then subtract that from the total number of students in the class.

First, let's find the number of girls on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we can express this as a fraction: $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 12 = 4$. Similarly, the number of boys on varsity is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 12 = 3$.

The total number of students on varsity is the sum of the number of girls and boys on varsity, which is $4 + 3 = 7$.

Now, we can find the number of students not on varsity by subtracting the number of students on varsity from the total number of students in the class: $24 - 7 = 17$.

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is 17.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of face masks Johnny bought, we need to calculate three times the number of face masks Mike purchased and then add 2.

Let's denote the number of face masks Mike bought as M. We know that M = 5.

Now, we need to find three times the number of face masks Mike bought: 3M = 3 * 5 = 15.

According to the problem, Johnny bought 2 more face masks than three times the number Mike bought. Therefore, the number of face masks Johnny bought is 15 + 2 = 17.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the ratio of the total number of teeth fixed to the total number of teeth James has.

Let's denote the number of teeth James has as $n_T = 30$. The dentist drills $n_D = 4$ teeth and caps $n_C = n_D + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11$ teeth.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth drilled and capped, which is $n_T = n_D + n_C = 4 + 11 = 15$.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula:

$\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100\%$

Substituting the values, we get:

$\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100\% = \frac{15}{30} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\%$

Therefore, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the amount of milk that was returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons. This can be done by multiplying 2/5 by 4000, which is equivalent to (2 * 4000) / 5.

2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons of milk were returned.

Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the total refund will be the cost per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons returned.

Refund = 1600 * 3.5 = 5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's analyze the given problem. We are given two pieces of information about Wendy and Colin's ages.

First, Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Second, in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation, we multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

C = 20

Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of books Bob can buy per school, we first need to calculate the total number of books he can purchase with his $27,000 budget. Given that he can buy 100 books for $500, we can establish a ratio of books to dollars.

Let's denote the number of books as 'b' and the cost per book as 'c'. We know that 100 books cost $500, so we can set up the following proportion:

100 books = $500
b books = $27,000

To find the number of books Bob can buy, we can set up a proportion and solve for 'b':

(100 books) / ($500) = (b books) / ($27,000)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

100 × $27,000 = $500 × b
$2,700,000 = $500b

Now, we can solve for 'b':

b = $2,700,000 / $500
b = 5,400

Since Bob is distributing the money to 3 schools, we can find the number of books he can buy per school by dividing the total number of books by 3:

Books per school = 5,400 / 3
Books per school = 1,800

Therefore, Bob can buy 1,800 books per school.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1800}$"
"Let's analyze the situation step by step, applying mathematical principles to determine the total number of apples Newton brought home.

Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. This can be represented as:

Initial apples = 2
Apples in pocket = 1
Apples thrown back into the tree = 1
Apples that fell out after throwing 1 apple = 5

Now, let's calculate the total number of apples after the first event:

Total apples = Initial apples + Apples that fell out after throwing 1 apple
Total apples = 2 + 5
Total apples = 7

Newton then put all but 1 of the new apples in his pocket, so he has 1 apple left outside and 5 apples in his pocket. This can be represented as:

Apples outside = 1
Apples in pocket = 5

Next, he threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. This can be represented as:

Apples that fell out after throwing the remaining apple = 6

Now, let's calculate the total number of apples after the second event:

Total apples = Apples outside + Apples in pocket + Apples that fell out after throwing the remaining apple
Total apples = 1 + 5 + 6
Total apples = 12

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to calculate the number of bags of coal he ordered and multiply it by the cost per bag.

The weight of coal ordered is 850 kg, and it is delivered in 50 kg bags. To find the number of bags, we divide the total weight by the weight per bag:

$$\frac{850\text{ kg}}{50\text{ kg/bag}} = 17\text{ bags}$$

The cost per bag is $18. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

$$17\text{ bags} \times \$18/\text{bag} = \$306$$

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will consume. Given that each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, and there are 6 friends, we can calculate the total number of slices for each type of pizza as follows:

Total cheese pizza slices = 6 slices/friend * 6 friends = 6 * 6 = 36 slices
Total pepperoni pizza slices = 4 slices/friend * 6 friends = 4 * 6 = 24 slices

Next, we divide the total number of slices for each type of pizza by the number of slices per pizza to determine the number of pizzas needed:

Number of cheese pizzas = Total cheese pizza slices / slices per pizza = 36 / 12 = 3
Number of pepperoni pizzas = Total pepperoni pizza slices / slices per pizza = 24 / 8 = 3

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is 3 + 3 = 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles he ran on each day and then sum them up.

Let's denote the miles Sam ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday as M. Since he ran 3 miles on each of these days, we can express this as 3M. 

Similarly, let's denote the miles Sam ran on Tuesday and Thursday as T. Since he ran 5 miles on each of these days, we can express this as 5T.

We know that M = 3 and T = 5. Therefore, the total miles Sam ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday is 3M = 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

The total miles Sam ran on Tuesday and Thursday is 5T = 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days: 9 + 10 = 19 miles.

The final answer is: 19"
"To determine the time it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider the rates at which he builds and melts snowballs.

Let's denote the rate at which Jay builds snowballs as B and the rate at which they melt as M. We know that Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. Therefore, his rate of building snowballs is B = 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, the rate at which they melt is M = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

To find the net rate of snowballs, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate: B - M = (1/3) - (2/15). To perform this subtraction, we need to find a common denominator, which is 15. Therefore, we can rewrite the building rate as (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Now, we can use the formula for exponential growth to model the number of snowballs Jay has at any given time t: N(t) = N0 * e^(rt), where N0 is the initial number of snowballs (0 in this case), r is the net rate of snowballs, and t is time in minutes.

However, since the rate of snowballs is not constant due to the melting, we need to use a differential equation to model the situation. Let's denote the number of snowballs at time t as N(t). Then, the rate of change of N(t) is dN/dt = B - M. We can rewrite this as dN/dt = (1/5) - (2/15) = (3/15) - (2/15) = 1/15.

To solve this differential equation, we can separate the variables: dN = (1/15)dt. Integrating both sides, we get N(t) = (1/15) * t + C, where C is the constant of integration.

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, we can set N(0) = 0 and solve for C: 0 = (1/15) * 0 + C, so C = 0.

Now, we want to find the time it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. We can set N(t) = 60 and solve for t: 60 = (1/15) * t. Multiplying both sides by 15, we get t = 60 * 15 = 900 minutes.

However, this is the time it would take if Jay didn't melt any snowballs. Since he melts 2 snowballs every 15 minutes, we need to account for this in our calculation.

Let's denote the time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs as t. During this time, he builds 20t/60 = t/3 snowballs and melts 2t/15 snowballs. Therefore, the net number of snowballs he has at time t is (t/3) - (2t/15) = (5t/15) - (2t/15) = 3t/15 = t/5.

We want to find the time t when the net number of snowballs is 60: t/5 = 60. Multiplying both sides by 5, we get t = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"Given that Digimon had its 20th anniversary, we can infer that the current year is 20 years after the release of the series. Let's denote the year of release as 'x'. Therefore, the current year is x + 20.

We are also given that John is 28 years old now, and we need to find Jim's age. Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up the following equation:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago

Let's denote John's age 20 years ago as J and Jim's age 20 years ago as M. We can express John's current age as J + 20 and Jim's current age as M + 20.

Since John is 28 now, we can write the equation as:

J + 20 = 28

Solving for J, we get:

J = 8

Now, we know that John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, so we can write the equation:

J = 2M

Substituting J = 8, we get:

8 = 2M

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

M = 4

Since M represents Jim's age 20 years ago, we can find Jim's current age by adding 20 to M:

Jim's current age = M + 20
= 4 + 20
= 24

Therefore, Jim is 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple arithmetic progression to determine the number of slices each person ate.

Let's denote the number of slices Doxa ate as x. Since her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, her sister ate x + 1 slices. Similarly, her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so he ate x + 2 slices.

We know that the total number of slices is 8, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 8.

Combining like terms, we get: 3x + 3 = 8.

Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get: 3x = 5.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 5/3.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a slice, this is an indication that our initial assumption about the number of slices each person ate is incorrect. Let's re-examine the problem.

A more accurate approach is to consider the number of slices each person ate as a sequence: Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 2 slices, and her brother ate 3 slices. This sequence is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 1.

We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.

In this case, the sum of the slices is 8, the first term is 1, and the last term is 3. We can set up the equation: 8 = n/2 * (1 + 3).

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8 = n/2 * 4.

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 16 = n * 4.

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: n = 4.

However, this is not the number of slices each person ate, but rather the number of terms in the sequence. Since we know the sequence is 1, 2, 3, we can conclude that Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 2 slices, and her brother ate 3 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages. This means they had x - 38 + 50 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 28 bandages. Therefore, they had (x - 38 + 50) - 28 bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. They had ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100 bandages left.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This gives us the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides, we get:

x = 21

Therefore, the initial number of bandages is 21.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the difference in length and multiply it by the cost per inch.

Let's denote the initial length of May's hair as $L_i$ and the final length as $L_f$. The difference in length is given by $L_i - L_f$. In this case, $L_i = 10$ inches and $L_f = 8$ inches.

The difference in length is $L_i - L_f = 10 - 8 = 2$ inches.

The cost per inch is $30. Therefore, the cost for the haircut is given by the product of the difference in length and the cost per inch: $2 \times 30 = 60$.

Adding the cost of the color, which is $40, we get the total cost: $60 + 40 = 100$.

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate her regular pay and attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. Since Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, her total hours worked in a week is 7.5 * 6 = 45 hours. With 4 weeks in April, her total hours worked in April is 45 * 4 = 180 hours. Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular pay is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus. Jen receives an additional $10 for each day she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 24 days. Her attendance bonus is 24 * $10 = $240.

Now, let's add her regular pay and attendance bonus to find her total earnings:
Total earnings = Regular pay + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $240
Total earnings = $510

The final answer is: $510"
"To determine the total amount Jason earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each task and then sum them up.

Let's break it down:

- Laundry: Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry once.
- Cleaning the room: He earns $1.50 for cleaning his room once.
- Taking the trash out: Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash out twice, so we multiply $0.75 by 2: $0.75 × 2 = $1.50.
- Emptying the dishwasher: He earns $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher six times, so we multiply $0.50 by 6: $0.50 × 6 = $3.00.

Now, let's add up the earnings:
$3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To determine the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to establish the blood volume of a single shark. Given that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can express this relationship as:

Blood in a shark = 3 × Blood in a whale
Blood in a shark = 3 × 40
Blood in a shark = 120 gallons

Now, to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we can multiply the blood volume of a single shark by the number of sharks:

Total blood in ten sharks = Blood in a shark × Number of sharks
Total blood in ten sharks = 120 × 10
Total blood in ten sharks = 1200 gallons

Therefore, the total amount of blood in ten sharks is 1200 gallons."
"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we can break down the problem into manageable parts. Let's denote the number of people who entered in the morning as M, the number of people who entered at 10:00 as T, and the number of people who entered in the evening as E.

We are given that M = 50. At 10:00, 40 more people entered, so T = 40. We are also told that twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in for lunch, which is 2T = 2 * 40 = 80. Finally, 3 times the number of people who entered in the morning came in for dinner, which is 3M = 3 * 50 = 150.

Now, we can calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant by adding up the number of people who entered at each time:
Total = M + T + 2T + 3M
Total = 50 + 40 + 80 + 150
Total = 320

The final answer is: 320"
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and the number of black pens.

First, we know Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 5 × 5 = 25 red pens.

We also know that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is 2 × 25 = 2 × 5 × 5 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"Given the problem, we can break it down into two parts: the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac.

Let's denote the cost of a bottle of scotch as $s. We know that John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600, so we can write the equation:

10s = 600

To find the cost of a single bottle of scotch, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10:

s = 600 / 10
s = 60

Now, we know that the cost of a bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost of a bottle of scotch. This means the cost of a bottle of cognac is 1.5 times the cost of a bottle of scotch, or 1.5s. We also know that John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, which is 20 bottles.

The total cost of the cognac is the cost per bottle multiplied by the number of bottles:

Total cost of cognac = 1.5s * 20
Total cost of cognac = 30s

Substituting the value of s, we get:

Total cost of cognac = 30 * 60
Total cost of cognac = 1800

The total cost of everything is the sum of the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac:

Total cost = 600 + 1800
Total cost = 2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To determine the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees separately and then add them together.

Let's denote the number of White Oak trees planted on the first day as W. Since Mr. Julius planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day is 2W.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted W = 20 White Oak trees and 2W = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it W + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is (1/4) * 2W = (1/4) * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 2W + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days:
White Oak: W + (W + 10) = 20 + 30 = 50
Lodgepole Pine: 2W + (2W + 10) = 40 + 50 = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days = 50 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To determine the amount of root beer available for each person to drink at the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the incidents and then divide it by the number of people at the party.

Let's start with the initial amount of root beer, which is 24 gallons.

On the first day, 4 gallons were stolen by Fred's children. This can be represented as a subtraction operation: 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled by Fred's wife, Barbie. This can be represented as another subtraction operation: 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, 5 gallons were taken by Fred's friend Ronnie. This can be represented as another subtraction operation: 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

Now, we have 8 gallons of root beer remaining. Since 3 people showed up for the party, we need to divide the remaining amount by 3 to find out how much each person got.

The amount each person got is calculated as follows:

$$\frac{8}{3} = 2\frac{2}{3}$$

To convert the mixed fraction to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

$$2\frac{2}{3} = 2 + \frac{2}{3} = 2 + 0.67 = 2.67$$

Therefore, each person got 2.67 gallons of root beer to drink during the party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use basic algebraic manipulation. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as x.

The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be expressed as 4x + 8. We are given that this expression is equal to 40. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to find the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we can express this as a fraction:

$\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = \frac{66}{3} = 22$

Next, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish:

$66 - 22 = 44$

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we can express this as a fraction:

$\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = \frac{5 \times 44}{11} = \frac{220}{11} = 20$

Finally, we can find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes by adding the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

$22 + 20 = 42$

Therefore, the total number of fish with red and blue stripes is 42.

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"To determine the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had, subtract the number of colors she lost, and then subtract the number of colors she used up.

Initially, Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets. Therefore, Amy had a total of 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one palette, which contained 4 eyeshadow colors. So, Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors. Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.

Next, Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors. Therefore, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"Given the problem, we can break it down into manageable components to determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor.

Let's denote Mattison's height as $M$, the height of the two-story house as $H$, and the height of the first floor as $F$. We are given that:

1. $M = 60$ inches
2. $H = 7M = 7 \cdot 60 = 420$ inches
3. $F = 3M = 3 \cdot 60 = 180$ inches

Since the total height of the two-story house is the sum of the height of the first floor and the height of the second floor, we can express this relationship as:

$H = F + S$

where $S$ is the height of the second floor. Substituting the known values, we get:

$420 = 180 + S$

Solving for $S$, we have:

$S = 420 - 180 = 240$ inches

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to consider the height of the second floor and the height of the roof above it. However, the problem only provides information about the height of the first floor and the total height of the house. We can infer that the height of the roof above the second floor is the difference between the total height of the house and the height of the second floor:

$H - S = 420 - 240 = 180$ inches

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we first need to calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas, which is 40% of the total shells.

Let's denote the total number of shells as $T = 700$. The number of shells found by team Alphas is then given by $0.4T = 0.4 \times 700 = 280$ shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share. This can be calculated as $T - 0.4T = 0.6T = 0.6 \times 700 = 420$ shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

The number of shells found by team The finders is $0.6 \times 420 = 252$ shells.

Finally, we can find the number of shells found by team Gogetters by subtracting the total number of shells found by teams Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells.

The number of shells found by team Gogetters is $T - (0.4T + 0.6T) = 0.0T = 0 \times 700 = 0$ shells is incorrect, the correct calculation is $T - (0.4T + 0.6T) = T - 1T = -0.6T = -0.6 \times 700 = -420$ shells is also incorrect, the correct calculation is $T -

"Given that Bernie has 4 dogs with varying exercise requirements, we can approach this problem by first calculating the total miles walked by all 4 dogs, which is the average miles per dog multiplied by the number of dogs. The average miles per dog is given as 3 miles, and there are 4 dogs. 

Total miles walked by all 4 dogs = Average miles per dog * Number of dogs
Total miles walked by all 4 dogs = 3 miles/dog * 4 dogs
Total miles walked by all 4 dogs = 12 miles

Now, we need to find the miles walked by the last dog. To do this, we subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all 4 dogs. The first three dogs walk a total of 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Miles walked by the last dog = Total miles walked by all 4 dogs - Miles walked by the first three dogs
Miles walked by the last dog = 12 miles - 8 miles
Miles walked by the last dog = 4 miles

The last dog needs 4 miles."
"To determine the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts, we need to calculate the loan amount and then subtract the amount used to pay off debts.

First, we calculate 40% of the value of his house, which is $250,000.

$$
\text{Loan Amount} = 0.4 \times 250,000 = 100,000
$$

Next, we calculate 60% of the loan amount to find out how much he used to pay off his debts.

$$
\text{Amount Used to Pay Off Debts} = 0.6 \times 100,000 = 60,000
$$

Now, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount to find the leftover amount.

$$
\text{Leftover Amount} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
$$

Therefore, John had $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To determine Deandre's total earnings from selling the tunas, we need to calculate the total weight of the tunas and then multiply it by the cost per kilogram.

The weights of the three tunas are given as 56 kilograms, 46 kilograms, and 26 kilograms. To find the total weight, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Total weight = 56 + 46 + 26

However, since this is a simple addition problem, we can also calculate it directly:

Total weight = 56 + 46 + 26
Total weight = 128 kilograms

Now, we need to find the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the cost per kilogram, which is $0.50.

Total earnings = Total weight * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

The final answer is: $64"
"To calculate Trinity's profit, we need to determine the selling price of the magazines. Given that she sells them at 11/8 of the cost price, we can express this as a multiplier of the cost price.

Let's denote the cost price as CP. The selling price (SP) can be calculated as:

SP = (11/8) * CP

We are given that the cost price (CP) is $72. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

SP = (11/8) * 72
SP = (11 * 72) / 8
SP = 792 / 8
SP = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:

Profit = SP - CP
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To determine the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement, we need to calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then sum these values.

Let's denote the amount of water removed per day on the low setting as L. Given that the medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, the amount of water removed per day on the medium setting is 2L. Similarly, the high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so the amount of water removed per day on the high setting is 2(2L) = 4L.

Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, so the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 3L. For the medium setting, he ran it for 3 days, resulting in a total of 3(2L) = 6L. Lastly, he ran the high setting for 5 days, which yields a total of 5(4L) = 20L.

To find the total amount of water removed, we sum the individual totals: 3L + 6L + 20L = 29L.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the number of balloons thrown during the water balloon fight, we need to calculate the total number of balloons initially available and then subtract the number of balloons left.

The total number of balloons can be found by multiplying the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack: 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons.

Next, we subtract the number of balloons left: 300 - 12 = 288.

Therefore, the number of balloons thrown is 288.

The final answer is: $\boxed{288}$"
"To determine the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we need to calculate the total amount of each medicine in one dose and then multiply it by 8.

The first medicine is 14 mL, and the second medicine is 3 times that amount, which is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

The total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the two medicines: 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8: 56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL.

The final answer is: $\boxed{448}$"
"To determine the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the capacity of John's classes and then sum it with Ali's class capacity.

First, we find the capacity of one of John's classes by taking 1/8 of Ali's class capacity. 

Let's denote Ali's class capacity as A = 120 students. Then, the capacity of one of John's classes is (1/8)A = (1/8)(120) = 15 students.

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his classes is 2 * (1/8)A = 2 * 15 = 30 students.

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of Ali's class and John's classes: A + 2 * (1/8)A = 120 + 30 = 150 students.

The final answer is: 150"
"To determine the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the total interest he owes his sister and subtract the total amount he pays in the first 11 months.

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is 11 * 25 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the initial amount plus the interest minus the amount he paid in the first 11 months. 

So, the amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = 31.

The final answer is: $31"
"Given that Jordan has 2 children who require 5 diaper changes per day each, we can calculate the total number of diaper changes per day as follows:

Total diaper changes per day = Number of children * Diaper changes per child per day
Total diaper changes per day = 2 * 5
Total diaper changes per day = 10

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, we can calculate the number of diapers she changes per day as follows:

Diapers changed by Jordan's wife per day = Total diaper changes per day / 2
Diapers changed by Jordan's wife per day = 10 / 2
Diapers changed by Jordan's wife per day = 5

Since Jordan's wife changes 5 diapers per day, Jordan changes the remaining half, which is also 5 diapers per day.

Therefore, the number of diapers Jordan changes per day is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Given the problem, we can approach it by first calculating the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the jar, is given by the formula:

V = lwh

where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

V = 6 * 6 * 15
V = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans is 80% of the total volume.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Now, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean, which is 0.15 cubic inches.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans he guessed. 

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

The final answer is: 36"
"To determine the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, let's analyze the situation step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, increasing the total to 60. At the second stop, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered the bus, which is 3/4 * 40 = 30 people. Therefore, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, resulting in a total of 2 * 90 = 180 people.

To find the number of remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current number of passengers from the bus's capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

Therefore, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

Initially, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 \* $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 \* $6 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost is 3 \* $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 \* $15 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is $30 + $45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the total time required for all students to try the escape room, we need to calculate the number of groups that can be formed from the total number of students and then multiply that by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

First, let's find the total number of students. There are 4 grades (4-7), and each grade has 10 students. So, the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Next, we need to find the number of groups that can be formed from 40 students, with 8 students in each group. This is a division problem, and we can calculate it as follows:

Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students per group
= 40 / 8
= 5

Now that we know there are 5 groups, and each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room, we can find the total time required for all students to try the escape room by multiplying the number of groups by the time per group:

Total time = Number of groups * Time per group
= 5 * 45
= 225 minutes

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for all students to try the escape room.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To determine the total amount Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.

The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can combine these costs as follows:

Total cost = (4 tables * $20 per table) + (2 frames * $10 per frame)
= (4 * $20) + (2 * $10)
= $80 + $20
= $100.

Therefore, the total amount Ali has to pay John is $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"Given a board that is 40 feet long, we can denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length is 4x.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 40

Dividing both sides by 5, we find:

x = 8

Now that we have determined the length of the shorter piece, we can calculate the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs, we must first calculate the total pounds of ground beef required to produce 80 meatballs. Given that he obtains 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can use the following proportion:

Let x be the total pounds of meat needed. Then, the number of meatballs produced from x pounds of meat is 16x. We want this to be equal to 80, so we can set up the equation:

16x = 80

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 16:

x = 80 / 16
x = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat, we can calculate the total amount of seasoning required. Since he adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound:

Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the amount of fabric Luke should buy, we need to calculate the total width of the windows and then multiply it by 2.

The width of one window is given as 35 inches, and there are 5 windows in total. We can calculate the total width of the windows by multiplying the width of one window by the number of windows.

Total width of windows = 35 inches/window × 5 windows = 35 × 5 = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we can calculate the required fabric by multiplying the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 × 175 inches = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric.

The final answer is: 350"
"To determine the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to consider the rate change after 16 minutes. The cost function can be represented as:

C(x) = 0.25x, for 0 ≤ x ≤ 16
C(x) = 0.2x, for x > 16

We can break down the 36-minute call into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is C(16) = 0.25(16) = $4.

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is C(36) - C(16) = 0.2(20) = $4.

The total cost is the sum of the costs for the two segments: $4 + $4 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"

"To determine the number of cupcakes Carly made, we need to establish a relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as x. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Therefore, the number of brownies can be expressed as 3x - 2.

Since each person in the class receives 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Now, let's solve the equation:

x + 3x - 2 = 10

Combine like terms:

4x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To determine the total cost of the services, we need to calculate the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure, and then add the cost of the nail art.

The original price of the manicure is $35, and the discount is 20% of this amount. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount rate: 0.20 * 35 = $7. Subtracting the discount from the original price gives us the discounted price of the manicure: $35 - $7 = $28.

Similarly, the original price of the pedicure is $40, and the discount is 20% of this amount. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount rate: 0.20 * 40 = $8. Subtracting the discount from the original price gives us the discounted price of the pedicure: $40 - $8 = $32.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is the sum of their discounted prices: $28 + $32 = $60.

The cost of the nail art is $3 per nail, and there are 10 fingers, so the total cost of the nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is the sum of their individual costs: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of magazines Susan receives annually, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and sum them up.

Let's denote the number of issues from the first 3 magazines as 12i, where i is the number of magazines. Since there are 3 magazines, we have 12 * 3 = 36 issues.

The second magazine sends 6 issues per year.

The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives a total of 66 magazines per year.

The final answer is: 66"
"To determine the number of paintings Kim has, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as K, the number of paintings Shelley has as S, and the number of paintings Samantha has as A.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. A = S - 12 (Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley)
2. S = K + 8 (Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim)
3. A = 27 (Samantha has 27 paintings)

Substituting equation (3) into equation (1), we get:

27 = S - 12

Solving for S, we get:

S = 27 + 12
S = 39

Now that we know Shelley has 39 paintings, we can substitute this value into equation (2) to find the number of paintings Kim has:

39 = K + 8

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:

K = 39 - 8
K = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

The final answer is: 31"
"To determine the price of the toy after the discounts, we'll apply the given percentage changes sequentially.

The initial price of the toy in November is $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To calculate the new price, we'll use the formula for percentage increase:

New price = Initial price + (Initial price * Percentage increase)
= $40 + ($40 * 0.8)
= $40 + $32
= $72

Now, in January, the price decreased by 50%. To calculate the new price, we'll use the formula for percentage decrease:

New price = Initial price - (Initial price * Percentage decrease)
= $72 - ($72 * 0.5)
= $72 - $36
= $36

Therefore, the price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"To determine the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the revenue from both the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons.

Let's start by calculating the revenue from the standard rate lessons. Since Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour, we can find the total revenue from these lessons by multiplying the number of lessons by the hourly rate:

Total revenue from standard rate lessons = 4 × $80 = $320

Next, we need to calculate the revenue from the reduced rate lessons. Since Charlie reduces his rate by 25%, the reduced rate is 75% of the standard rate. We can find the reduced rate by multiplying the standard rate by 0.75:

Reduced rate = $80 × 0.75 = $60 per hour

Now, we can find the total revenue from the reduced rate lessons by multiplying the number of lessons by the reduced rate:

Total revenue from reduced rate lessons = 2 × $60 = $120

To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we add the revenue from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons:

Total revenue = Total revenue from standard rate lessons + Total revenue from reduced rate lessons
= $320 + $120
= $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To calculate the mean score, we need to find the arithmetic mean of the given set of scores. The arithmetic mean is calculated by summing all the scores and then dividing by the total number of scores.

Given scores: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, 60

First, let's find the sum of the scores:
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630. There are 9 scores in total.

Now, let's calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the total number of scores:
\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of scores}}{\text{Total number of scores}} = \frac{630}{9}
\]

To find the mean, we perform the division:
\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{630}{9} = 70
\]

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of pomelos Eve gave away as x.

We know that after giving away x pomelos, Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount. This can be expressed as:

20 - x = (1/4) * 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 - x = 5

To find the value of x, we can isolate it by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

-x = 5 - 20
-x = -15

Multiplying both sides by -1 to solve for x:

x = 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

First, we need to find the number of apples Walter ate. This can be calculated as 2/5 of the total number of apples, which is 60.

$$\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24$$

So, Walter ate 24 apples.

Next, we need to find the number of apples remaining. This is the total number of apples minus the number eaten.

$$60 - 24 = 36$$

Now, we need to find the number of apples Walter gave to his sister, which is 25% of the remaining apples.

$$\frac{25}{100} \times 36 = \frac{25}{100} \times \frac{36}{1} = \frac{25 \times 36}{100} = \frac{900}{100} = 9$$

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples.

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. This is the number of remaining apples minus the number given to his sister.

$$36 - 9 = 27$$

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply the number of apples sold by the price per apple.

$$27 \times 3 = 81$$

The final answer is: $81"
"To determine the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we can set up a proportion based on the information given. If 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year, we can represent this as:

9 = (3/4) * x

where x is the total number of novels written this year.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3 to isolate x:

x = 9 * (4/3)

x = 12

Therefore, Regina wrote 12 novels this year.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we first need to calculate the total distance he traveled in 3 days. Given his average speed of 50 km/hr, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed × Time

Since there are 24 hours in a day, Michael traveled for 3 × 24 = 72 hours.

Distance = 50 km/hr × 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the distance covered by dividing the distance traveled by the total distance between Alaska and Texas, and then multiplying by 100.

Percentage covered = (Distance traveled / Total distance) × 100
= (3600 km / 6000 km) × 100
= 0.6 × 100
= 60%

Therefore, the percentage of the distance covered by Michael is 60%."
"To determine the initial number of grapes, let's analyze the situation step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of grapes as x. Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

The remaining grapes are used by their mother to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she can make is x - 36 / 12. However, since the number of pies must be a whole number, we can set up the equation:

x - 36 = 12n

where n is the number of pies. Solving for x, we get:

x = 12n + 36

Since the mother used all the remaining grapes to make 3 pies, we can substitute n = 3 into the equation:

x = 12(3) + 36
x = 36 + 36
x = 72

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider that the mother used all the remaining grapes after Madeline and her brother used 36 grapes. This means that the number of grapes left after Madeline and her brother used their grapes is x - 6 - 30 = x - 36.

"To determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School on that day, we need to consider the number of teachers who were not absent and the number of substitute teachers.

Let's denote the total number of teachers as T, the number of teachers who were sick as S, and the number of substitute teachers as N. We are given that T = 82 and S = 13. The number of teachers who were not sick is T - S.

Number of teachers not sick = T - S
= 82 - 13
= 69

The total number of teachers at school is the sum of the teachers who were not sick and the substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers at school = Number of teachers not sick + Number of substitute teachers
= 69 + 9
= 78

Therefore, the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School that day was 78."
"To determine the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in a year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. 
The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00.
The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total weekly cost of the macaroni and cheese is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To determine the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we first need to calculate the total time spent cleaning and the total available time.

The custodian has 80 classrooms to clean, and it takes them 15 minutes per classroom. Therefore, the total time spent cleaning is 80 * 15 minutes = 1200 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1200 / 60 = 20 hours.

The custodian works 8 hours a day for 5 days, so the total available time is 5 * 8 = 40 hours.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms by dividing the time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiplying by 100: (20 / 40) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms is 50%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we must first calculate the capacity of each shelf. 

Let's denote the capacity of a middle shelf as M. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, its capacity is 2M. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so its capacity is 2M - 5.

The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all its shelves: M + M + 2M + (2M - 5) = 4M - 5.

We are given that each middle shelf can hold 10 books. Therefore, M = 10.

Now, we can substitute M = 10 into the equation for the total capacity of one bookcase: 
4(10) - 5 = 40 - 5 = 35.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are needed to hold all of them. To do this, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 
110 / 35 = 22/7 ≈ 3.14 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase).

However, since each bookcase has 3 shelves and we know that the middle shelves can hold 10 books each, the bottom shelf can hold 20 books, and the top shelf can hold 15 books, we can also calculate the total capacity of one bookcase as 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase gives us: 
110 / 55 = 2.

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate Rose's profit, we first need to determine the total cost of the eggs. Since she bought five dozens for $2.40 per dozen, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Total Cost = Number of Dozens × Cost per Dozen
Total Cost = 5 × $2.40
Total Cost = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Rose bought a total of 5 × 12 = 60 eggs.

Next, we need to find the total revenue. Rose sells the eggs in sets of 3 for $1 per set. To determine the number of sets, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:

Number of Sets = Total Number of Eggs ÷ Number of Eggs per Set
Number of Sets = 60 ÷ 3
Number of Sets = 20

Now, we can calculate the total revenue:

Total Revenue = Number of Sets × Price per Set
Total Revenue = 20 × $1
Total Revenue = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the number of white hats, we'll break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that half of the hats are red. This can be expressed as 0.5 * 100 = 50 red hats.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

Next, we find the number of blue hats, which is 3/5 of the remaining hats. This can be calculated as 50 * (3/5) = 30 blue hats.

Now, to find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats: 100 - 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to calculate the discounted price of the bag and then divide it by the number of sticks.

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's discounted by $3.00. Therefore, the discounted price is:

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

To convert the discounted price to cents, we multiply by 100:

$15.00 × 100 = 1500 cents

Now, we can find the cost of each stick of jerky by dividing the total cost in cents by the number of sticks per bag:

1500 cents ÷ 30 sticks = 50 cents per stick

Therefore, the cost of each stick of jerky is 50 cents.

Let's denote the total number of questions as T. Since she needs to get 70% of T correct, we can express this as 0.7T. We also know that T = 70 (first test) + 40 (second test) = 110 questions.

Now, we can set up the equation: 0.7T = 77 (since 70% of 110 is 77). However, we can also express this as 0.7(70 + 40) = 77, which simplifies to 0.7(110) = 77.

To find the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test, we can subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test (42) from the total number of questions she needs to get right (77). This gives us 77 - 42 = 35.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B.

We are given that B = 5S - 4 and S + B = 116.

We can substitute the expression for B into the second equation: S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

The final answer is: $\boxed{96}$"
"To determine the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we can apply the fundamental principles of arithmetic operations. Specifically, we will utilize the concept of multiplication to calculate the total points.

Let's break down the problem:

- Number of games per year: 40
- Score per game: 21 points
- Number of years: 4

To find the total points scored in one year, we multiply the number of games by the score per game: 40 games/year * 21 points/game = 840 points/year.

Now, to find the total points scored in four years, we multiply the total points scored in one year by the number of years: 840 points/year * 4 years = 3360 points.

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360.

The final answer is: 3360"
"To determine the number of marbles Brendan ended up with, we can break down the sequence of events:

1. Initially, Brendan had 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, which is equivalent to 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. When he searched for the dropped marbles, he found 3 more, resulting in a total of 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. Upon inspecting the marbles, he discovered that one of them was a bead, not a marble, so he removed it from the count, leaving him with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Therefore, the correct answer is 7."
"To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus, we can break down the problem into a series of ratios.

Let's start by establishing the conversion rate from customers to sales: for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold. This can be represented as a ratio of 1:2 or 1/2.

Next, we need to find the conversion rate from telephone calls to customers. Jason knows that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes into the car dealership. This can be represented as a ratio of 1:25 or 1/25.

To find the total number of telephone calls needed to sell 15 cars, we can multiply the number of sales by the conversion rate from customers to sales (2) and then multiply the result by the conversion rate from telephone calls to customers (25).

Let's calculate this:

Number of sales = 15
Conversion rate from customers to sales = 2
Conversion rate from telephone calls to customers = 25

Number of customers needed = Number of sales * Conversion rate from customers to sales
= 15 * 2
= 30

Number of telephone calls needed = Number of customers needed * Conversion rate from telephone calls to customers
= 30 * 25
= 750

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's consider the flashlights. Since there are 4 people in the household, and each person has a flashlight, the total number of flashlights is simply 4.

Next, we'll calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house, and we're told that half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, while the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

To find the number of small candles, we can multiply the number of rooms with small candles (4) by the number of candles per room (4), which gives us 4 * 4 = 16 small candles.

Similarly, to find the number of medium candles, we multiply the number of rooms with medium candles (4) by the number of candles per room (5), which gives us 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.

Now, we add the total number of small candles and medium candles to get the total number of candles: 16 + 20 = 36.

Finally, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 + 36 = 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of chips each family member receives, we first calculate the total number of chips available. Since Mitchell purchases two bags of chips, each containing 55 chips, the total number of chips is given by the product of the number of bags and the number of chips per bag:

2 bags × 55 chips/bag = 110 chips

Now, to find the number of chips each family member receives, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members:

110 chips ÷ 5 family members = 22 chips/family member

Therefore, each family member receives 22 chips.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we can calculate the time for each side and then sum them up. 

Let's denote the time for the first side as $t_1 = 5$ minutes. The second and third sides take twice as long, so $t_2 = t_3 = 2t_1 = 2(5) = 10$ minutes. The last two sides take half as long as the first side, so $t_4 = t_5 = \frac{t_1}{2} = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5$ minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total time by summing up the time for all the sides: $t_{total} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + t_4 + t_5 = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30$ minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"Given the scenario, we can establish a relationship between the number of robots, helmets, and footballs. Let's denote the number of footballs as F, the number of helmets as H, and the number of robots as R.

We are given that H = 20. It is also stated that R = H/2 and H = F/2.

Substituting the value of H into the equation R = H/2, we get R = 20/2 = 10.

Now, substituting the value of H into the equation H = F/2, we get 20 = F/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get F = 40.

To find the total number of items, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs together: R + H + F = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the number of calls Tim deals with in a 5-day work week, we need to calculate the total number of calls he handles in a day and then multiply it by the number of working days.

First, let's find the number of calls Tim handles in a day. We know that he spends 6 hours at work and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call. To convert the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours, we use the conversion factor: 15 minutes = 15/60 hours = 0.25 hours.

Now, we can calculate the number of calls he handles in a day using the formula:

Number of calls per day = Total hours at work / Time per call
= 6 hours / 0.25 hours per call
= 24 calls per day

To find the total number of calls he handles in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he handles in a day by the number of working days:

Total calls in a week = Number of calls per day * Number of working days
= 24 calls per day * 5 days
= 120 calls

Therefore, the total number of calls Tim handles in a 5-day work week is 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the time difference in drying between the old and new varnishes on 6 paintings, we first calculate the total time for each type of varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The time it takes for the old varnish to dry on one painting is 7 minutes. Therefore, the total time for 6 paintings is 6 * 7 = 42 minutes.

The time it takes for the new varnish to dry on one painting is 12 minutes. Consequently, the total time for 6 paintings is 6 * 12 = 72 minutes.

Now, we find the difference in time between the old varnish and the new varnish: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we must calculate the water required for each type of plant and sum these values.

First, we identify the number of plants in each category: 4 plants need half a cup of water, 8 plants need 1 cup of water, and the remaining plants need a quarter of a cup of water. The number of plants requiring a quarter of a cup of water is 20 - 4 - 8 = 8.

Now, we calculate the water needed for each type of plant. For the 4 plants requiring half a cup of water, the total is 4 \* 0.5 = 2 cups. For the 8 plants requiring 1 cup of water, the total is 8 \* 1 = 8 cups. For the 8 plants requiring a quarter of a cup of water, the total is 8 \* 0.25 = 2 cups.

To find the total amount of water Crista needs, we sum the water required for each type of plant: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"Given that Phineas Frog is 200 yards away from his home in the swamp, we can break down his journey into two segments: hopping on land and swimming through water. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we have two equal segments of 100 yards each.

To calculate the time taken for each segment, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

For the land segment, the speed is 20 yards per minute, so the time taken is 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.

For the water segment, the speed is 10 yards per minute, so the time taken is 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

The total time taken to return home is the sum of the times for each segment: 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.

Therefore, the total time taken for Phineas to return home is 15 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of the popsicle sticks, we need to calculate the number of boxes required and then multiply it by the cost per box.

Given:
- Number of popsicle sticks needed: 56
- Popsicle sticks per box: 8

To find the number of boxes needed, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of sticks per box:

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Now, we need to find the total cost of the boxes. The cost per box is $2.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

Total cost = Number of boxes × Cost per box

"Given that the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone and the main phone costs $20, we can establish a relationship between the cost of the main phone and the cost of each additional phone.

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, we can express the cost of the main phone as 2x.

We are given that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

$$
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{20}{2}
$$

$$
x = 10
$$

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

$$
4x = 4 \cdot 10
$$

$$
4x = 40
$$

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

$$
\text{Total cost} = 20 + 40
$$

$$
\text{Total cost} = 60
$$

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine Derrick's daily revenue, we first need to calculate the number of doughnuts he sells in a day. Since he produces 10 dozen doughnuts, and 1 dozen is equivalent to 12, the total number of doughnuts per day is 10 × 12 = 120.

Given that each doughnut is sold at $2, the daily revenue can be calculated as 120 × $2 = $240.

June has 30 days. Therefore, the total revenue for the month can be found by multiplying the daily revenue by the number of days in June: $240 × 30 = $7200.

"To determine the time it takes for John to speak 10 pages, we first need to calculate his new speaking speed after training. 

Let's denote John's original speaking speed as S = 150 WPM. After training, his speed increases by a factor of 2.5, so his new speed is S' = 2.5S = 2.5 * 150 WPM = 375 WPM.

Next, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page contains 450 words, so the total number of words is 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words at a speed of 375 WPM. Time is equal to the total number of words divided by the speaking speed, so the time is t = 4500 / 375 = 12 hours.

Therefore, it would take John 12 hours to speak 10 pages at his new speed.

"To determine the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining four days.

Let's start by calculating the number of people Conor saw on the first three days. On the first day, he saw 50 people. On the second day, the number of people increased by 20, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people. On the third day, the number of people doubled from the second day, so he saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

The final answer is: $\boxed{500}$"
"To determine the total number of popcorn pieces Garrett has to eat, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and add them up.

Let's denote the number of kernels that popped in the first 30 seconds as $K_1 = 20$. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so $K_2 = 3K_1 = 3 \cdot 20 = 60$ kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped, so $K_3 = 4K_1 = 4 \cdot 20 = 80$ kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so $K_4 = 0.5K_3 = 0.5 \cdot 80 = 40$ kernels popped.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so $K_5 = 0.25K_4 = 0.25 \cdot 40 = 10$ kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
$K_{\text{total}} = K_1 + K_2 + K_3 + K_4 + K_5 = 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210$

"To determine the number of lemons required, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade to be made. Since Tim wants to make 4 gallons for the party and an extra gallon for Allen, the total amount of lemonade is 5 gallons.

Given that each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, we can calculate the total cups of juice needed as follows:

Total cups of juice = 5 gallons × 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups

Now, we need to find out how many lemons are required for the extra tart lemonade. This lemonade is twice as tart as the other gallons, which means it requires twice the amount of lemon juice. 

Extra tart lemonade cups = 1 gallon × 2 = 2 cups

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons required for the extra tart lemonade as follows:

Extra tart lemons = 2 cups / (1 cup / 6 lemons) = 2 × 6 = 12 lemons

For the regular lemonade, we need to calculate the number of lemons required for 4 gallons:

Regular lemons = 4 gallons × (1 cup / 6 lemons) × 6 = 4

Now, we can find the total number of lemons required by adding the lemons needed for the regular and extra tart lemonade:

Total lemons = Extra tart lemons + Regular lemons = 12 + 4 = 16 lemons

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total amount of dog food required for the kennel, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both German Shepherds and Bulldogs, and then multiply it by 7 to find the weekly consumption.

The daily consumption of dog food can be calculated as follows:

- German Shepherds: 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg/day
- Bulldogs: 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg/day

Total daily consumption: 15 kg/day + 6 kg/day = 21 kg/day

Now, to find the weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7:

"To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged and 4-legged animals separately and then find the total number of pairs.

Let's denote the number of 2-legged animals as $n_2$ and the number of 4-legged animals as $n_4$. We are given that $n_2 = 10$ and $n_4 = 15$.

The total number of legs from the 2-legged animals is $2n_2 = 2 \cdot 10 = 20$.
The total number of legs from the 4-legged animals is $4n_4 = 4 \cdot 15 = 60$.

The total number of legs on the farm is the sum of the legs from the 2-legged and 4-legged animals: $2n_2 + 4n_4 = 20 + 60 = 80$.

To find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2: $\frac{2n_2 + 4n_4}{2} = \frac{80}{2} = 40$.

Therefore, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"Given the problem, we can approach it by first identifying the number of blue and yellow blocks. We know there are 4 blue blocks, and the number of yellow blocks is twice that, which is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is the sum of these two quantities: 4 + 8 = 12.

Now, we can use the fact that the total number of blocks in the tower is 32 to find the number of red blocks. We can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Total number of blocks = Number of blue blocks + Number of yellow blocks + Number of red blocks
32 = 4 + 8 + Number of red blocks

Subtracting the number of blue and yellow blocks from both sides of the equation gives us the number of red blocks:

Number of red blocks = 32 - 12
Number of red blocks = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the distance Elvis is from his house now, we need to consider the total distance traveled in the eastward direction. 

Since Elvis traveled 5 hours west at 18mph, the distance traveled west is given by the formula d = rt, where d is the distance, r is the rate (or speed), and t is the time. 

d_west = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

Then, Elvis traveled 8 hours east at the same speed of 18mph. The distance traveled east is also given by the formula d = rt.

d_east = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

To find the net distance from his house, we need to subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east.

d_net = d_east - d_west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the value of the boat after three years, we'll apply the concept of depreciation, which is a reduction in the value of an asset over time. 

The initial value of the boat is $9000. 

In the first year, the boat depreciates by 30%, which can be calculated as follows:

Depreciation in the first year = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

In the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30% of its value after the first year:

Depreciation in the second year = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20% of its value after the second year:

Depreciation in the third year = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

Therefore, the value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To determine the number of pink candies in the bag, we need to first calculate the number of orange and yellow candies.

Let's denote the number of red candies as R, the number of orange candies as O, and the number of yellow candies as Y. We are given that R = 54, O = 2R, and Y = R/2.

Given R = 54, we can calculate O as 2 * 54 = 108 and Y as 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we can find the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies: R + O + Y = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, the number of pink candies is 232 - 189 = 43.

The final answer is: 43"
"To calculate the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to consider the expenses for the hotel and the bus trips separately.

The cost of the hotel can be calculated by multiplying the cost of one night by the number of nights. Let's denote the cost of one night as $80 and the number of nights as 3.

$$\text{Total cost of the hotel} = 80 \times 3 = 240$$

The cost of each bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel. We can express this as a decimal by multiplying 80 by 0.1.

$$\text{Cost of one bus trip} = 80 \times 0.1 = 8$$

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the bus trips by multiplying the cost of one bus trip by the number of trips.

$$\text{Total cost of the bus trips} = 8 \times 7 = 56$$

To find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels, we add the total cost of the hotel and the total cost of the bus trips.

$$\text{Total cost} = 240 + 56 = 296$$

The final answer is: $296"
"Given that Mazie has 52 marbles and gives them to twins, Dallas and Darla, and Dallas has a total of 21 marbles after dropping 4 of them in the playground, we can determine the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla.

First, we need to find out how many marbles Dallas initially received. Since he has 21 marbles after dropping 4, we can calculate his initial amount as follows:

Dallas' initial marbles = 21 (current marbles) + 4 (dropped marbles)
Dallas' initial marbles = 25

Now, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting Dallas' initial marbles from the total number of marbles given by Mazie:

Marbles given to Darla = Total marbles given - Dallas' initial marbles
Marbles given to Darla = 52 - 25
Marbles given to Darla = 27

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla."
"To determine the total cost of the family's cinema outing, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately and then add them together.

The cost of the adult tickets is 2 * $12 = $24. This is a straightforward application of the distributive property of multiplication over addition.

The cost of the child ticket is $8. This is a simple arithmetic operation.

The cost of the popcorns is 2 * $3 = $6. Again, this is a straightforward application of the distributive property of multiplication over addition.

Now, let's add the costs together: $24 + $8 + $6 = $38.

In mathematical notation, this can be represented as:

Total Cost = Cost of Adult Tickets + Cost of Child Ticket + Cost of Popcorns
Total Cost = 2 * 12 + 8 + 2 * 3
Total Cost = 24 + 8 + 6
Total Cost = 38

Therefore, the total cost of the family's cinema outing is $38."
"To determine the force required to move the car, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. This can be done by adding their individual weights together.

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can express this as a decimal by multiplying the total weight by 0.01.

Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

Therefore, the force required to move the car is 16 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

Given that the length (l) is 20 feet and the width (w) is 15 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(20) + 2(15)
P = 40 + 30
P = 70

Therefore, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"Given that Mia is 40 years old and she is younger than Emma by 16 years, we can determine Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age. Therefore, Emma's age is 40 + 16 = 56 years.

To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we need to calculate the sum of their ages and divide it by 2. The sum of their ages is 40 + 56 = 96. Dividing this sum by 2 yields the average age: 96/2 = 48.

The average age of Mia and Emma is 48."
"To determine the total number of good seashells, we need to calculate the total number of seashells found and then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

Let's denote the total number of seashells found as S, the number of seashells found by Tom as T, the number of seashells found by Nancy as N, and the number of seashells found by Benny as B. We are given that T = 214, N = 432, and B = 86.

The total number of seashells found is the sum of the seashells found by each individual: S = T + N + B.

S = 214 + 432 + 86
S = 732

Next, we need to subtract the number of cracked seashells, denoted as C, from the total number of seashells found to determine the number of good seashells: G = S - C, where G is the number of good seashells and C = 67.

G = S - C
G = 732 - 67
G = 665

Therefore, the total number of good seashells found is 665.

The final answer is: 665"
"To determine the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then multiply it by the number of people.

Let's denote the cost of dinner plates as $6, bowls as $5, and salad plates as $4. Since Avery needs 12 of each type of plate, we can express the total cost as:

Total Cost = (Cost of Dinner Plates) + (Cost of Bowls) + (Cost of Salad Plates)
Total Cost = (6 * 12) + (5 * 12) + (4 * 12)

Using the distributive property of multiplication, we can simplify the expression:

Total Cost = 6 * 12 + 5 * 12 + 4 * 12
Total Cost = 72 + 60 + 48

Now, we can add the numbers to find the total cost:

Total Cost = 72 + 60 + 48
Total Cost = 180

The final answer is: $180"
"To determine the time it took Anna to complete the puzzle, we need to calculate half of Steve's time and then add 2 hours to it.

Let's denote Steve's time as S. We know that S = 10 hours.

Half of Steve's time is S/2 = 10/2 = 5 hours.

Anna's time is 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, so we can express it as S/2 + 2. Substituting the value of S/2, we get:

Anna's time = 5 + 2 = 7 hours.

Therefore, it took Anna 7 hours to complete the puzzle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the amount of feed left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs and subtract it from the initial amount ordered.

First, let's calculate the daily feed consumption of the pigs. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the daily consumption per pig is 4 × 2 = 8 pounds. Since there are 5 pigs, the total daily consumption is 5 × 8 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the weekly consumption. There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly consumption is 40 pounds/day × 7 days = 40 × 7 = 280 pounds.

Given that Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, the amount left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount John needs to spend on hot dogs, we must first calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party.

Let's denote the number of guests as $g$, the number of hot dogs each guest will eat as $h$, and the number of hot dogs already available as $a$. We are given that $g = 20$, $h = 2$, and $a = 4$. 

The total number of hot dogs required is given by the product of the number of guests and the number of hot dogs each guest will eat, minus the number of hot dogs already available:

Total hot dogs required = $gh - a$

Substituting the given values, we get:

Total hot dogs required = $(20)(2) - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36$

Since each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find the number of packs required. This can be calculated by dividing the total hot dogs required by the number of hot dogs per pack:

Number of packs required = $\frac{36}{6} = 6$

The cost of the hot dogs can be found by multiplying the number of packs required by the cost per pack:

Cost = Number of packs required $\times$ Cost per pack
= $6 \times 2$
= $12$

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine Frances' remaining funds, we need to calculate her total revenue and subtract her total expenses.

First, let's calculate her revenue from cupcakes: 20 cupcakes * $2 = $40. This is a straightforward application of the multiplication operation.

Next, we'll calculate her revenue from cookies: 40 cookies * $1 = $40. Again, this is a simple multiplication operation.

Now, we'll add her revenue from cupcakes and cookies to find her total revenue: $40 + $40 = $80.

Moving on to her expenses, we know she purchased 5 trays at $4 each. To find her total expenses, we'll multiply the number of trays by the cost per tray: 5 trays * $4 = $20.

Finally, we'll subtract her total expenses from her total revenue to find her remaining funds: $80 - $20 = $60.

Therefore, Frances has $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step, applying mathematical principles to determine the final number of children following the ice cream truck.

Initially, we have 5 children. On the second street, each of these children is joined by another child, resulting in a total of 5 + 5 = 10 children.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 additional children. To find the total number of children, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: 

10 + 2(10) = 10 + 20 = 30

However, this calculation only accounts for the children joining the group on the third street. We must also consider the original 5 children who are leaving the group. To find the final number of children, we subtract the original 5 from the total:

30 - 5 = 25

Therefore, the final number of children following the ice cream truck is 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of meals she has and the total number of meals she has already given out.

Let's denote the total number of meals Mamou has as M and the total number of meals given out as G. We are given that M = 1,360 and G = 64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday).

G = 64 + 30 + 48
G = 142

Now, we can calculate the number of meals left to distribute by subtracting G from M.

M - G = 1,360 - 142
M - G = 1,218

Therefore, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.

The final answer is: 1218"
"To determine the total amount of money James has, we need to calculate the value of each coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth 25 cents, which can be represented as 25¢ or $0.25. Two nickels are worth 2 x 5¢ = 10¢. Seven dimes are worth 7 x 10¢ = 70¢.

Now, let's add the values together:
25¢ + 10¢ + 70¢ = 105¢

Converting the total to dollars, we get:
105¢ = $1.05

Therefore, James has a total of $1.05.

The final answer is: $1.05"
"To determine the total age of the siblings, we need to calculate the age of the older brother and then sum the ages of all the siblings.

Let's denote the age of the older brother as x. Since one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother, we can express this relationship as:

x / 2 = 12

To find the value of x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 12 * 2
x = 24

Now that we know the age of the older brother, we can calculate the total age of the 3 sisters, who are all 16 years old:

Total age of sisters = 3 * 16
Total age of sisters = 48

Next, we calculate the total age of the 2 brothers:

Total age of brothers = 12 + 24
Total age of brothers = 36

Finally, we sum the total age of the brothers and sisters to find the total age of all the siblings:

Total age of all siblings = Total age of brothers + Total age of sisters
Total age of all siblings = 36 + 48
Total age of all siblings = 84

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation per week. Since Charisma meditates 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, the total meditation time per day is 30 minutes. With 7 days of meditation per week, the total meditation time per week is:

30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week

Next, we'll calculate the time spent on yoga per week. Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes, 5 days a week. Therefore, the total yoga time per week is:

60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week

Now, we can find the total time spent on meditation and yoga per week by adding the time spent on each activity:

210 minutes/week (meditation) + 300 minutes/week (yoga) = 510 minutes/week

To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly time by 4:

510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2040}$"

Let's denote the number of small shirts as S, medium shirts as M, and large shirts as L. We are given that S = 11, M = 8, and L = 6.

The area of a small shirt is 3 square feet, a medium shirt is 4 square feet, and a large shirt is 6 square feet. Therefore, the total area of the quilt can be calculated as:

Total Area = (3 * S) + (4 * M) + (6 * L)
Total Area = (3 * 11) + (4 * 8) + (6 * 6)
Total Area = 33 + 32 + 36
Total Area = 101

The final answer is: 101"
"To determine the total number of sunflower seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower. 

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has $3 \times 12 = 36$ seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by $\frac{1}{2}$, which is $36 \times \frac{1}{2} = 18$. Then, we add this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower: $36 + 18 = 54$ seeds in a large sunflower.

Now, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower to find the total number of seeds: $36 + 54 = 90$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"Given that George has 18 pens, we can determine the number of pens Timothy and Sarah have by applying basic arithmetic operations.

Let's start by finding the number of pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, we can express this relationship as:

Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Now, we need to find the number of pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can express this relationship as:

Sarah's pens = (1/2) * Timothy's pens
Sarah's pens = (1/2) * 54
Sarah's pens = 27

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"Given the problem, we can establish a series of equations to solve for Jackie's height before summer.

Let's denote Jackie's height before summer as J, and Albert's height as A. We know that Albert is 36"" tall, so A = 36.

We are also given that Anne is twice the size of Albert, so Anne's height is 2A = 2 * 36 = 72"".

Since Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, we can express her current height as A + 2 = 72 + 2 = 74"".

However, we also know that Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, so her current height is J + 3. Equating this to her current height of 74"", we get J + 3 = 74.

To find Jackie's height before summer, we need to solve for J. Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation, we get J = 74 - 3 = 71"".

Therefore, Jackie's height before summer was 71"".

The final answer is: $\boxed{71}$"
"To determine the total revenue generated by the company, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

First, let's find the total number of bars produced in one week. Since the company produces 5000 bars per day, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bars produced in one week is:

5000 bars/day × 7 days/week = 35000 bars/week

Now, we need to find the total number of bars produced in two weeks. We can simply multiply the number of bars produced in one week by 2:

35000 bars/week × 2 weeks = 70000 bars

The price per bar is $2. To find the total revenue, we multiply the total number of bars by the price per bar:

70000 bars × $2/bar = $140000

Therefore, the company will receive $140000 for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks.

The final answer is: $140000"
"To determine the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's consider the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, we can use the formula for the total cost of the T-shirts:

Total cost of T-shirts = (2 * original price of one T-shirt) - (1 * discount on one T-shirt)
= (2 * $8) - (1 * $8 * 0.5)
= $16 - $4
= $12

Alternatively, we can use the concept of average cost to simplify the calculation:

Average cost of one T-shirt = (original price of one T-shirt + discounted price of one T-shirt) / 2
= ($8 + $4) / 2
= $12 / 2
= $6

Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total cost of the T-shirts is 2 * $6 = $12.

Next, let's consider the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:

Discount = original price * discount percentage
= $40 * 0.4
= $16

The discounted price of the shoes is the original price minus the discount:

Discounted price of shoes = original price - discount
= $40 - $16
= $24

Now, we can find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store by adding the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes:

Total amount spent = cost of T-shirts + cost of shoes
= $12 + $24
= $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the number of movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to calculate his total earnings from his allowance and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan's weekly allowance is $6, and he completed his chores for 3 weeks. Therefore, his total earnings from allowance are:

$$
\text{Total Allowance} = 6 \times 3 = 18
$$

The cost of ice cream cones for Ryan and his 3 friends is $1.25 per cone, and they bought a total of 4 cones. So, the total cost of ice cream cones is:

$$
\text{Cost of Ice Cream Cones} = 4 \times 1.25 = 5
$$

Now, we subtract the cost of ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:

$$
\text{Remaining Money} = \text{Total Allowance} - \text{Cost of Ice Cream Cones} = 18 - 5 = 13
$$

To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket:

$$
\text{Number of Tickets} = \frac{\text{Remaining Money}}{\text{Cost of a Ticket}} = \frac{13}{6.50} = 2
$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani, we need to add up the costs of all the items purchased.

Ellen's purchases can be represented as:
Ellen's total = Cost of leggings + Cost of photo frame
Ellen's total = $100 + $5
Ellen's total = $105

Lani's purchases can be represented as:
Lani's total = Cost of sunglasses + (2 x Cost of bathrobes)
Lani's total = $30 + (2 x $100)
Lani's total = $30 + $200
Lani's total = $230

Now, we can find the total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani by adding their individual totals:
Total amount spent = Ellen's total + Lani's total
Total amount spent = $105 + $230
Total amount spent = $335

The final answer is: $335"

"To determine the amount of money Janet has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract that from the amount her parents gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on movie tickets. Since she bought two tickets at $7.50 each, we can express this as a simple multiplication problem:

2 × $7.50 = $15

Now, let's add the cost of the ice cream and the bracelet to the total amount spent on movie tickets:

$3.50 (ice cream) + $15 (movie tickets) + $8.50 (bracelet) = $27

Now, we can subtract the total amount spent from the amount her parents gave her:

$40 (initial amount) - $27 (total spent) = $13

"To determine Josh's earnings over a 2-week period, we need to calculate the number of days he is open and the number of cars he services in that time.

Josh operates his car shop 5 days a week, as he is closed on Sundays and Wednesdays. Therefore, in a week, he is open for 5 days. 

In a week, Josh services 3 cars per day, so the total number of cars serviced in a week is 5 days/week * 3 cars/day = 15 cars/week.

Over a 2-week period, Josh services 15 cars/week * 2 weeks = 30 cars.

Given that Josh earns $4 per car, his total earnings over 2 weeks can be calculated as follows:

Total earnings = Number of cars serviced * Earnings per car
Total earnings = 30 cars * $4/car
Total earnings = $120

"To determine the number of cookies Randy has now, we need to apply basic arithmetic operations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. We can represent this as a sum of the individual cookie quantities:

Total cookies initially = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18

Randy then consumes 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This can be represented as a subtraction from the total:

Cookies eaten = 3

Randy also eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. We can update the oatmeal cookie quantity by subtracting 2 from the initial quantity:

Oatmeal cookies remaining = 9 - 2 = 7

Now, let's update the total number of cookies eaten:

Cookies eaten = 3 (snack) + 2 (lunch) = 5

Randy gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. We can update the sugar cookie quantity by subtracting 2 from the initial quantity:

Sugar cookies remaining = 5 - 2 = 3

Now, let's update the total number of cookies eaten or given away:

Cookies eaten or given away = 5 (eaten) + 2 (given away) = 7

Randy bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. This can be represented as an addition to the initial quantities:

New oatmeal cookies = 7 + 4 = 11
New chocolate chip cookies = 4 + 4 = 8
New sugar cookies = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has now:

Total cookies now = New oatmeal cookies + New chocolate chip cookies + New sugar cookies
Total cookies now = 11 + 8 + 7
Total cookies now = 26

"To determine the total amount Matthew would earn from selling his collection of 12 unique toy soldiers, we need to calculate the revenue from the two halves of the collection separately and then sum them.

Let's denote the number of toy soldiers in each half as $n$. Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can express this as $2n = 12$, which implies $n = 6$.

For the first half, Matthew would receive $5 per toy, so the revenue from this half is $5n = 5(6) = 30$.

For the second half, he would receive $7 per toy, so the revenue from this half is $7n = 7(6) = 42$.

To find the total revenue, we add the revenues from both halves: $30 + 42 = 72$.

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many days it takes Nate to fill them in.

First, let's find the total number of holes dug by the dog. Since the dog digs 6 holes per day and Nate is on vacation for 14 days, we can use the formula:

Total holes = Rate of digging × Time
Total holes = 6 holes/day × 14 days
Total holes = 84 holes

However, the dog digs 6 new holes every night, so we need to add these to the total holes dug during the day. Since Nate fills the holes for the same number of days he was on vacation, we can assume the same time frame for filling the holes.

Holes dug at night = 6 holes/day × 14 days
Holes dug at night = 84 holes
Total holes = 84 + 84
Total holes = 168 holes

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. He fills 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is:

Net holes filled per day = 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day
Net holes filled per day = 3 holes/day

To find the number of days it takes to fill the holes, we can use the formula:

Days to fill holes = Total holes / Net holes filled per day
Days to fill holes = 168 holes / 3 holes/day
Days to fill holes = 56 days

Since we need to find the number of weeks, we'll divide the total days by 7:

Weeks to fill holes = Days to fill holes / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 56 days / 7 days/week
Weeks to fill holes = 8 weeks

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first determine the average enrollment at Butler High School. Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can express this relationship as a ratio.

Let's denote the average enrollment at Norman High School as N = 4000. The average enrollment at Butler High School can be represented as (3/4)N.

Average enrollment at Butler High School: (3/4)N = (3/4)(4000) = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in enrollment: N - (3/4)N = (1/4)N = (1/4)(4000) = 1000

Therefore, the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School is 1000 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"

T = 7995
R = 2595
O = 3075

We can calculate the number of chocolate chip cookies as follows:

C = T - (R + O)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

Therefore, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2325}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes as t, b, and p, respectively.

We are given the following information:

1. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: t = 16 / 2 = 8.
2. Igor gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested: t = p + 2. However, we already know t = 8, so p + 2 = 8, which implies p = 6.
3. Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers: b = 7.
4. The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29: t + b + p = 29.

Now, let's substitute the known values into the equation: 8 + 7 + 6 = 21. However, we know that the total number of items is 29, so we need to find the number of beakers that Igor lost.

Let's denote the number of beakers lost as x. Then, the total number of items Igor had is 8 + 7 - x + 6 = 21 - x. Since this total is equal to 29, we can set up the equation 21 - x = 29.

Solving for x, we get x = 21 - 29 = -8. However, since we cannot lose a negative number of beakers, this is not a valid solution.

Let's re-examine the information. We know that Igor gathered 8 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 6 Petri dishes. The total number of items he gathered is 8 + 7 + 6 = 21. Since the total number of items on the lab bench is 29, Igor must have lost 29 - 21 = 8 beakers.

"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. Therefore, the total number of screws needed for each table is 4 legs * 2 screws/leg = 8 screws/table.

Since James is assembling 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 screws/table * 4 tables = 32 screws.

Now, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws James has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"Given that there are 10 eggs in the first basket, and the second basket contains twice as many eggs, we can express this relationship as a simple ratio. Let's denote the number of eggs in the first basket as x, and the number of eggs in the second basket as 2x.

We are given that x = 10, so the number of eggs in the second basket is 2x = 2(10) = 20.

To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we can add the number of eggs in each basket: x + 2x = 3x.

Substituting the value of x, we get 3(10) = 30.

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"

Let's denote the amount raised by Alexandra as A. Since Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, we can express Kim's contribution as A + $320.

Given that Alexandra raises $430, we can set up the equation A = $430. Substituting this value into Kim's expression, we get Kim's contribution as $430 + $320 = $750.

Next, let's consider Maryam's contribution. We know she raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. Therefore, Maryam's contribution can be expressed as $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we can calculate the total amount raised by adding the individual contributions: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Given the scenario, let's analyze the information provided:

Let's denote Aaron's speed as A miles per minute and Vanessa's speed as V miles per minute. We are given that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so we can express this relationship as:

A = 2V

We are also given that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. Since distance equals speed multiplied by time, we can express this relationship as:

V * t = 2 * A * t', where t is the time Vanessa takes to run her part of the race and t' is the time Aaron takes to run his part.

Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can express this as:

V * t = 2 * A * t'

We are also given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs half the distance of Vanessa, we can express this as:

A * t' = 2 miles

Substituting A = 2V into the above equation, we get:

2V * t' = 2 miles

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

V * t' = 1 mile

Since V * t = 2 * A * t', we can substitute A = 2V into this equation to get:

V * t = 2 * 2V * t'

Simplifying, we get:

V * t = 4V * t'

Dividing both sides by V, we get:

t = 4t'

Substituting V * t' = 1 mile into this equation, we get:

t = 4 * (1 / V)

Since A = 2V, we can express A in terms of t' as:

A = 2V = 2 / t'

Substituting A = 2 / t' into the equation A * t' = 2 miles, we get:

(2 / t') * t' = 2 miles

Simplifying, we get:

2 = 2 miles

This equation is true, so we can proceed with the substitution A = 2 / t' into the equation V * t = 2 * A * t'.

Substituting A = 2 / t' into this equation, we get:

V * t = 2 * (2 / t') * t'

Simplifying, we get:

V * t = 4

Since V * t = 4, we can substitute V * t' = 1 mile into this equation to get:

4 = 4 * (1 / V)

Simplifying, we get:

V = 1

Now that we know V = 1, we can find the time it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile:

t = 1 / V
= 1 / 1
= 1 minute

However, this is the time it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can multiply this time by 4 to get the total time it takes Vanessa to complete her part of the race:

t = 1 minute * 4
= 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs to buy, we must first calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we can use the formula:

Total line required = Length of dock * Line per foot of dock
Total line required = 200 feet * 3 feet/foot
Total line required = 600 feet

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. To find out how much he needs to buy, we subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required:

Line to buy = Total line required - Line already available
Line to buy = 600 feet - 6 feet
Line to buy = 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To determine the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue. Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, and each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. Therefore, the daily revenue can be calculated as follows:

Daily revenue = (2 meals * $5) + $5 (bottle of wine)
             = (2 * $5) + $5
             = $10 + $5
             = $15

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, we can now calculate the weekly revenue by multiplying the daily revenue by the number of days open:

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * Number of days open
               = $15 * 2
               = $30

Therefore, Tom's restaurant makes $30 per week."
"To determine the selling price of each watermelon, we need to calculate the cost and selling price of the watermelons.

Given that the fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, we can find the cost price of one watermelon by dividing the total cost by the number of watermelons:

Cost price of 1 watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
= $80 / 50
= $1.60

Now, we are told that the vendor sold all the watermelons at a profit of 25%. This means the selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit). We can calculate the selling price of one watermelon as follows:

Selling price of 1 watermelon = Cost price of 1 watermelon * (1 + Profit percentage)
= $1.60 * (1 + 25/100)
= $1.60 * 1.25
= $2

Therefore, the selling price of each watermelon is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Given the information provided, we can deduce the current age of James and subsequently determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years.

Let's denote the current age of Dora as D. Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2D. We are also given that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years. Therefore, D = 9.

Now, we can find James' current age: 2D = 2(9) = 18 years.

However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the information provided. If John had James when he was 19, and James is currently 18, it implies that John is not the father of James. This inconsistency suggests that the problem statement may contain an error.

Assuming the problem is intended to be solvable, let's proceed with the information given. We are told that John had James when he was 19, but this statement is inconsistent with the information that James is 18. Therefore, we will ignore this statement and focus on the information about Dora and James.

We are also given that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. Let's denote the current age of John's youngest son as Y. Since John was 32 when his youngest son was born, Y = 32.

To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: Y + 3 = 32 + 3 = 35 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after an hour, we need to calculate their respective rates of peeling oranges and then find the difference.

Let's denote the number of oranges Ana peels in 1 hour as A and the number of oranges Jane peels in 1 hour as J. We know that Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so her rate of peeling oranges is 60 / 3 = 20 oranges per hour. Similarly, Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so her rate of peeling oranges is 60 / 4 = 15 oranges per hour.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is A - J = 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

Therefore, the correct answer is 5."
"To determine the total cost of the new radiator and installation, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the labor cost.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. To find the cost after an 80% discount, we can use the formula:

Discounted Cost = Original Cost - (Original Cost * Discount Rate)
Discounted Cost = 400 - (400 * 0.8)
Discounted Cost = 400 - 320
Discounted Cost = 80

The cost of the radiator after the discount is $80.

Next, we need to calculate the labor cost. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so the labor cost is:

Labor Cost = Hourly Rate * Number of Hours
Labor Cost = 50 * 3
Labor Cost = 150

The total cost is the sum of the discounted cost of the radiator and the labor cost:

Total Cost = Discounted Cost + Labor Cost
Total Cost = 80 + 150
Total Cost = 230

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's analyze the problem. We have two types of animals: chickens and cows. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can express this as an equation: C + W = 20, where C is the number of chickens and W is the number of cows.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can express the total number of legs as 2C + 4W = 70.

To solve for the number of chickens, we can use the substitution method. We can express W in terms of C from the first equation: W = 20 - C.

Substituting this expression for W into the second equation, we get 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

Therefore, the number of chickens is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we calculate the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is given by the product of the number of pizzas and the number of slices per pizza: $7 \times 8 = 56$.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find out how many slices each person can have: $\frac{56}{4} = 14$.

Therefore, each person can have $\boxed{14}$ slices."
